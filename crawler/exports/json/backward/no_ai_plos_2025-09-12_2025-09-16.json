    "title": "Impaired hematopoiesis and embryonic lethality at midgestation of mice lacking both lipid transfer proteinsVPS13AandVPS13C",
    "abstract": "VPS13 is the founding member of a family of proteins that mediate lipid transfer at intracellular membrane contact sites by a bridge-like mechanism. Mammalian genomes comprise 4VPS13genes encoding proteins with distinct localizations and function. The gene duplication resulting inVPS13AandVPS13Cis the most recent in evolution and, accordingly, these two proteins are the most similar to each other. However, they have distinct subcellular localizations and their loss of function mutations in humans are compatible with life but result in two different age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases, chorea-acanthocytosis and Parkinson’s disease, respectively. Thus, it remains unclear whether these two proteins have overlapping functions. Here, we show that whileVps13aKO andVps13cKO mice are viable, embryonic development ofVps13a/Vps13cdouble knockout (DKO) mice is arrested at midgestation. Prior to death, DKO embryos were smaller than controls, were anemic and had a smaller liver, most likely reflecting defective embryonic erythropoiesis which at this developmental stage occurs primarily in this organ. Further analyses of erythroid precursor cells showed that their differentiation was impaired and that this defect was accompanied by activation of innate immunity as revealed by upregulation of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Additionally, the RIG-I and MDA5 components of dsRNA triggered innate immunity were found upregulated in the DKO fetal liver. Activation of innate immunity may result from loss of integrity of the membranes of intracellular organelles, such as mitochondria and autophagic lysosomes, or to impaired autophagy, due to the absence of these lipid transport proteins. The surprising and striking synthetic effect resulting for the combined loss of VPS13A and VPS13C suggests that despite of the different localization of these two proteins, the lipid fluxes that they mediate are partially redundant.",

    "abstract": "Discriminative learning enhances contrast between sensory inputs to allow fast and accurate decision-making. However, the neural mechanisms that selectively enhance sensory representations to improve discrimination remain unclear. Here, we show that learning-induced differential gating of olfactory inputs takes place at the first stage of sensory processing in the mouse olfactory bulb and requires dopaminergic short axons cells (SACs). Optical imaging, spatial transcriptomics, and electron microscopy experiments reveal that synaptic and structural plasticity in SACs allows odor valence-based modulation of their interactions with other cell types in the olfactory glomeruli. Importantly, an increase in tyrosine hydroxylase expression by SACs surrounding responding glomeruli, with a bias towards those activated by reward odors, creates a valence-based modulation of sensory input. Further, we identify cholinergic input from the horizontal limb of the diagonal band as the valence-dependent signal that modulates SAC activities and refines sensory representation via disinhibition. Our findings reveal a circuit mechanism where an interneuron population serves as a central hub integrating sensory input and top–down signal to enhance sensory acuity.",

    "abstract": "By selectively amplifying relevant sensory input, animals efficiently allocate limited cognitive resources to improve decision-making. Allocation of attention is aligned with behavioral goals and adaptive to cognitive demand, but the circuit mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identify an attention circuit for odor processing where cholinergic neurons in the horizontal nucleus of the diagonal band provide top–down control through inhibitory dopaminergic short-axon cells in the mouse olfactory bulb. Attentional cue triggered cholinergic activity provides preparatory disinhibition of olfactory sensory axons to enhance response to reward-associated odors and improves decision-making. Preparatory, but not reward-dependent, cholinergic activity is disengaged in proficient animals when the task becomes routine, underlying a trade-off between proficiency and attention engagement. Direct manipulation of the disinhibitory circuit reinstates attentional effect without eliciting general arousal. A computational model of the circuit recapitulates the dynamic change in attention responses and illustrates a two-stage adaptation that efficiently allocates cognitive resources.",

    "abstract": "Individual variation in sociability is a central feature of every society. This includes honey bees, with some individuals well connected and sociable, and others at the periphery of their colony’s social network. However, the genetic and molecular bases of sociability are poorly understood. Trophallaxis—a behavior involving sharing liquid with nutritional and signaling properties—comprises a social interaction and a proxy for sociability in honey bee colonies: more sociable bees engage in more trophallaxis. Here, we identify genetic and molecular mechanisms of trophallaxis-based sociability by combining genome sequencing, brain transcriptomics, and automated behavioral tracking. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with variation in sociability. Several SNPs were localized to genes previously associated with sociability in other species, including in the context of human autism, suggesting shared molecular mechanisms of sociability. Variation in sociability also was linked to differential brain gene expression, particularly genes associated with neural signaling and development. Using comparative genomic and transcriptomic approaches, we also detected evidence for divergent mechanisms underpinning sociability across species, including those related to reward sensitivity and encounter probability. These results highlight both potential evolutionary conservation of the molecular roots of sociability and points of divergence.",

    "title": "Hexokinase 2 is an RNA-binding protein that regulates mRNA translation independently of glycolysis and induces melanoma cell proliferation",
    "abstract": "Although metabolic benefits of glycolysis have been extensively described in tumor cells, the extra-metabolic functions linked to this energetic pathway in tumor growth and cell proliferation have not been clearly established yet. Recently, some key glycolytic enzymes, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase 2, were reported to regulate mRNA translation. Translational control of gene expression is considered as a critical effector in cancer biology, representing a highly promising area of research. Here, we report that Hexokinase 2 (HK2), a glucose kinase that catalyzes the first step of glycolysis at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), is an RNA-binding protein (RBP) that regulates mRNA translation in melanoma cell lines. Polysome profiling experiments followed by RNA sequencing indicate that the translational regulation exerted by HK2 is partly independent of the metabolic status or the glycolytic pathway. We found that HK2 specifically regulates translation of the mRNA encoding SOX10, a transcription factor implicated in the regulation of tumor initiation, maintenance, and progression in melanoma. RNA-protein interaction assays, including CrossLinking ImmunoPrecipitation (CLIP), indicate that HK2 is an RBP whose interaction with RNA is independent of its enzymatic activity, its ability to bind glucose or its association with the OMM. HK2 directly interacts with the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR) of theSOX10mRNA through a stem-loop RNA secondary structure. Using RNA-protein proximity ligation assays and a fluorescence-based ribosome-bound mRNA mapping method, we found that high glucose conditions, which promote the release of HK2 from the OMM, induce an increase in HK2-SOX10mRNA interaction andSOX10mRNA translation in the cytoplasm. We further showed that HK2-dependentSOX10mRNA translation is involved in melanoma cell proliferation and colony formation. Collectively, our data highlight a nonmetabolic function of HK2 acting as an RBP and translation regulator.",

    "title": "Jointly representing long-range genetic similarity and spatially heterogeneous isolation-by-distance",
    "abstract": "Isolation-by-distance patterns in genetic variation are a widespread feature of the geographic structure of genetic variation in many species, and many methods have been developed to illuminate such patterns in genetic data. However, long-range genetic similarities also exist, often as a result of rare or episodic long-range gene flow. Jointly characterizing patterns of isolation-by-distance and long-range genetic similarity in genetic data is an open data analysis challenge that, if resolved, could help produce more complete representations of the geographic structure of genetic data in any given species. Here, we present a computationally tractable method that identifies long-range genetic similarities in a background of spatially heterogeneous isolation-by-distance variation. The method uses a coalescent-based framework, and models long-range genetic similarity in terms of directional events with source fractions describing the fraction of ancestry at a location tracing back to a remote source. The method produces geographic maps annotated with inferred long-range edges, as well as maps of uncertainty in the geographic location of each source of long-range gene flow. We have implemented the method in a package calledFEEMSmix(an extension toFEEMS), and validated its implementation using simulations representative of typical data applications. We also apply this method to two empirical data sets. In a data set of over 4,000 humans (Homo sapiens) across Afro-Eurasia, we recover many known signals of long-distance dispersal from recent centuries. Similarly, in a data set of over 100 gray wolves (Canis lupus) across North America, we identify several previously unknown long-range connections, some of which were attributable to recording errors in sampling locations. Therefore, beyond identifying genuine long-range dispersals, our approach also serves as a useful tool for quality control in spatial genetic studies.",

In mammalian cells, Ld live in vacuolar compartments calledLeishmaniaparasitophorous vacuoles (LdLPVs) that enigmatically divide following parasite replication. We evaluated the role of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery in the scission of LdLPVs. We found that ESCRT components are constitutively recruited to LdLPVs. We propose that this recruitment depends on the expression of PI(3,4)P2 on LdLPVs. The knockdown (KD) of upstream components of the ESCRT machinery revealed that ALIX, but not TSG101 or VPS28, led to a significant reduction in the parasite burden in infected cultures. Interestingly, LdLPVs in ALIXKDs were more distended and harbored more than 2 parasites. Incorporation of BrdU intoLeishmaniain THP-1 macrophages revealed that parasite replication was inhibited in ALIXKD due to defective LdLPV scission. These findings establish that non-canonical activation of the ESCRT machinery is required forLeishmaniato replicate within macrophages.",

    "title": "A BRC1-modulated switch in auxin efflux accounts for the competition between Arabidopsis axillary buds",
    "abstract": "As part of their modular development, plants continuously adapt their shoot branching architecture according to environmental conditions. This occurs by regulating the activity of axillary buds established in each leaf axil. Whether a bud grows into a shoot depends partly on the presence of other active shoots, which can inhibit bud activation. This systemic coordination is proposed to be mediated by the transport network of the plant hormone auxin, with buds competing to establish sustained transport of auxin, termed canalized auxin transport, into the main stem. A second hormone, strigolactone, tunes this competition by influencing the removal of the PIN1 auxin export protein from the plasma membrane, and hence the dynamics of canalization. Strigolactone also regulates the expression of another key regulatory hub, the bud-expressed transcription factorBRANCHED1(BRC1). The interplay between auxin transport and BRC1 in regulating bud activity is poorly understood. Here, we investigate this interplay in the context of competition between buds, using Arabidopsis explants with two axillary buds as a minimal system. Using experimental data, we develop a mathematical model of bud-bud competition in which BRC1 influences the establishment of canalized auxin transport by regulating the basal rate of auxin efflux in buds. We identify single model parameters that plausibly correspond to the dual impact of strigolactone onBRC1expression and PIN1. We show that modulating these two parameters reproduces the dynamics of bud growth and bud-bud competition observed in relevant mutants and treatments. Our model produces testable hypotheses, which we validate by generating a chimeric PIN1 auxin transporter with impaired strigolactone sensitivity, helping us uncouple the effects of strigolactone on PIN1 and BRC1. These results support the hypothesis that BRC1 influences local bud competitiveness by downregulating the basal rate of auxin efflux in buds. Together with the systemic feedbacks in the auxin transport network, this enables plants to adjust dynamically the number and location of growing branches.",

    "abstract": "Cell survival depends upon the ability to adapt to changing environments. Environmental stressors trigger an acute stress response program that rewires cell physiology, downregulates proliferation genes and pauses the cell cycle until the cell adapts. After the acute response is resolved, cells resume cycling but at a reduced rate. The importance of cell cycle changes for survival in chronic stress is not clear. Here, we show that dynamic phosphorylation of the yeast cell cycle-regulatory transcription factor Hcm1 is required to maintain fitness in chronic stress. Hcm1 is activated by cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) during S-phase and is inactivated by the phosphatase calcineurin (CN) in response to stressors that signal through increases in cytosolic Ca2+. Cells expressing a constitutively active, phosphomimetic Hcm1 mutant exhibit a reduction in fitness in stress, suggesting Hcm1 inactivation promotes survival. However, a comprehensive analysis of Hcm1 phosphomutants revealed that Hcm1 activity is also important to survive stress, and that all mutants with fixed phosphorylation states are less fit in stress. Moreover, our data suggests that pulses of Hcm1 activity are necessary to maximize target gene expression in stress. These findings demonstrate that expression levels of Hcm1 target genes influence fitness in stress and suggest that the dynamic phosphorylation of cell cycle regulators plays a crucial role in promoting survival in stressful environments.",

    "title": "Parallel regulatory circuits orchestrate biofilm formation in response to c-di-GMP levels and growth phase",
    "abstract": "Biofilm formation is a highly regulated process that contributes to the environmental fitness of microorganisms, including pathogenic bacteria. The second messenger c-di-GMP is a critical regulator of biofilm formation whose cellular levels are tightly regulated by the abundance and activity of diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and phosphodiesterases (PDEs). These enzymes synthesize and degrade c-di-GMP, respectively. TheVibrio choleraeVpvABC system encodes a DGC and is critical for biofilm formation; however, much remains unknown about its regulation. Here we demonstrate that thevpvABCsystem is transcriptionally regulated by c-di-GMP and the master biofilm regulators VpsT and VpsR. However, we also identify the alternative sigma factor RpoS as a positive regulator ofvpvABC. RpoS is involved in the regulation of many c-di-GMP metabolism genes and plays a role in biofilm architecture, likely mediated in part throughvpvC. In mature biofilms,vpvAtranscription was highest near the biofilm substratum and VpsT, VpsR, and RpoS were critical forvpvABCtranscription. Overall, our genetic dissection reveals thevpvABCsystem is regulated by two parallel circuits: a c-di-GMP sensing-circuit acting through VpsT and VpsR and a stationary growth phase circuit via RpoS. These findings underscore the multilayered regulatory mechanisms that precisely govern biofilm formation by a pathogen.",

    "abstract": "The gonad ofCaenorhabditis eleganshermaphrodites is a longstanding model of cell migration, stem cell niche function, and organogenesis, but it has not yet been investigated using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). Using a recently published scRNA-seq dataset of adultC. eleganshermaphrodites, we identified a previously unknown regulator of the leader cell of gonad migration (the distal tip cell, or DTC). The genemig-21is both highly and specifically expressed in the DTC, yet has no known role in that cell. However,mig-21regulates cell migration in other developmental contexts. Using classical genetics techniques, RNAi knockdown, and live cell imaging, we discovered thatmig-21acts synergistically with the Wnt and Netrin pathways to guide anteroposterior and dorsoventral phases of migration in the DTC at the level of signaling, not DTC cell structure. Known interactors ofmig-21in other cell types–like PTP-3C–also act with MIG-21 in DTC migration. Despite its expression in stationary adult DTCs,mig-21does not play a role in the cessation of DTC migration but instead seems to impart continued sensitivity of the DTC to Wnt and Netrin in adulthood. This study reveals additional complexity of signaling integration between major regulators of germline stem cell niche migration, and as a proof of concept it demonstrates the utility of scRNA-seq datasets in revealing testable hypotheses about genetic networks that were masked by redundancy in traditional screening methods.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, repression of germline-specific gene expression is essential for preserving somatic cell identity and preventing disease. Germline gene silencing is often dependent on the presence of promoter 5-cytosine DNA methylation (5meC). Early mammalian development, however, is marked by a dramatic loss of 5meC levels genome-wide. Recent research has highlighted a specialized variant of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1, PRC1.6, as a key regulator that maintains transient silencing of germline genes in this embryonic window. Eventually, PRC1.6 seems to stimulate the recruitment ofde novoDNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), although the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Evidence suggests a coordinated epigenetic relay, potentially involving direct protein interactions and shaping the local histone modification landscape. This review explores PRC1.6 as a central epigenetic hub that connects Polycomb repression, histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation, and DNA methylation pathways. Unraveling this interplay will provide key insights into the mechanisms that maintain the critical barrier between the germline and the soma, essential not only for proper development but also for preserving somatic cell function and health throughout life.",

    "title": "A genome-wide analysis of YY1 and TFAP2 competition on overlapping motifs reveals their roles in HPV-induced carcinogenesis",
    "abstract": "The long non-coding RNA lnc-FANCI-2 acts as a host defense RNA and is highly expressed in HPV-positive cervical lesions. Its activation relies on the binding of the transcription factor YY1 to two conserved motifs in its promoter. We used DNA oligo pull-down combined with mass spectrometry to identify proteins binding to the lnc-FANCI-2 promoter, discovering new TFAP2 family members that compete with YY1 for binding at overlapping sites. In primary epithelial cells, TFAP2 binding led to lnc-FANCI-2 silencing. However, in HPV-positive cancer cells, increased YY1 levels displaced TFAP2, alleviating repression. Genome-wide predictions using the JASPAR database identified thousands of YY1 and TFAP2 competition binding sites (CBSs), many overlapping with CHIP-seq peaks for YY1, TFAP2A, and TFAP2C, predominantly in promoter regions. We validated competition at two CBSs in the promoter and found it likely regulates cancer-related genes PPP1R15B and LRRC37A. This suggests that YY1 and TFAP2 competition might influence a broader transcriptional regulation network in HPV-induced cancer. This study reveals a novel transcriptional antagonism mechanism affecting lnc-FANCI-2 and other cancer-related genes, highlighting YY1 and TFAP2 as potential therapeutic targets in HPV-driven carcinogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires’ disease, exists ubiquitously in natural and artificial water systems. This pathogen poses serious threat to human health. One salient feature ofL. pneumophilapathogenesis is the hundreds of effectors delivered into host cells by its Dot/Icm transporter. These virulence factors interfere with multiple hosts signaling pathways to subvert host defense. The ubiquitin network is essential in host signaling involved in immunity and thus is a common target ofL. pneumophilaeffectors. At least thirteen Dot/Icm effectors have been shown to function as E3 ubiquitin ligases that cooperate with the host ubiquitination machinery by distinct mechanisms. In addition, seven deubiquitinases (DUBs) have been characterized. Furthermore, effectors that utilize catalysis mechanisms that are chemically distinct from the canonical one found in eukaryotes have been reported, indicating that hijacking of the host ubiquitin network byL. pneumophilais extensive and complex. Here, we identified ubiquitin interacting proteins with a proximity labeling method and found that the effector Lug14 (Lpg1106) functions as a novel ubiquitin ligase. Lug14 works with the E2 UbcH5c to catalyze ubiquitination with a preference for K11-linked chains by a mechanism that does not require a cysteine residue. Finally, we found that Lug14 targets ARIH2, a member of the host RBR E3 ligase family, leading to increased activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages.",

    "abstract": "The Tripartite Attachment Complex (TAC) is essential for mitochondrial DNA (kDNA) segregation inTrypanosoma brucei, providing a physical link between the flagellar basal body and the mitochondrial genome. Although the TAC’s hierarchical assembly and linear organization have been extensively studied, much remains to be discovered regarding its complete architecture and composition – for instance, our identification of a new TAC component underscores these knowledge gaps. Here, we use a combination of proteomics, RNA interference (RNAi), and Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (U-ExM) to characterize the TAC at high resolution and identify a novel component, TAC53 (Tb927.2.6100). Depletion of TAC53 in both procyclic and bloodstream forms results in kDNA missegregation and loss, a characteristic feature of TAC dysfunction. TAC53 localizes to the kDNA in a cell cycle-dependent manner and represents the most kDNA-proximal TAC component identified to date. U-ExM reveals a previously unrecognized tubular architecture of the TAC, with two distinct TAC structures per kDNA disc, suggesting a mechanism for precise kDNA alignment and segregation. Moreover, immunoprecipitation and imaging analyses indicate that TAC53 interacts with known TAC-associated proteins HMG44, KAP68, and KAP3, forming a network at the TAC–kDNA interface. These findings redefine our understanding of TAC architecture and function and identify TAC53 as a key structural component anchoring the mitochondrial genome inT. brucei.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying insect resistance to Cry toxins produced by the soil bacteriumBacillus thuringiensis(Bt) is crucial for the sustainable utilization of Bt-based products. Previously, we identified that the reduced expression of theCAD,ABCC2andABCC3genes through a eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is associated with Bt Cry1Ac resistance in the cotton bollworm,Helicoverpa armigera. Here, we found that an eIF2 alpha kinase, GCN2, is highly conserved in Lepidoptera insects. Its inhibitor GCN2iB (ATP-competitive inhibitor of serine/threonine protein kinase, stress-responsive kinase) could decrease the toxicity of Cry1Ac, and the GCN2 enzyme activities decreased after larvae fed Cry1Ac. The expression level of theHaGCN2gene and the enzymatic activity of its corresponding protein were significantly down-regulated in the BtR resistant strain. Moreover, both BiFC and Y2H assays demonstrated that eIF2 could interact with GCN2. Finally, the silencing ofHaGCN2expression not only decreased the protein and phosphorylation levels of eIF2α but also reduced the expression ofHaCAD,HaABCC2, andHaABCC3. This consequently led to a decrease in the toxicity of Cry1Ac towardHelicoverpa armigera. These results indicate that GCN2 conferring Cry1Ac resistance inH. armigerathrough regulating the expression of eIF2. This finding deepens our understanding of the transcriptional regulation of midgut Cry receptor genes and the molecular basis of insect resistance to Bt Cry toxins.",

    "abstract": "Invasive candidiasis, primarily caused byCandida albicans, represents the most common fungal disease among hospitalized patients and poses a significant threat to human health. Intrinsic or acquired immunosuppression serves as a critical risk factor predisposing individuals to this disease, while simultaneously reducing the efficacy of conventional antifungal therapies and worsening clinical outcomes. Given the central role of immune dysfunction in the pathogenesis of invasive candidiasis, immunotherapeutic strategies hold substantial promise. We targeted dectin-1, the primary pattern recognition receptor for β-1,3-glucan, by engineering XJ104, a bispecific T-cell engager that fuses dectin-1 to the light chains of an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody. This construct is designed to bridgeCandidaβ-1,3-glucan with CD3 on T cells, thereby inducing anti-Candidaimmunity. Our results demonstrate that XJ104 exhibits high specificity for β-1,3-glucan and activates effector cells in aCandida-dependent mannerin vitro. In murine models, XJ104 enhances Th1 and Th17 responses and confers significant protection against bothC. albicansandnon-albicansinfections. Crucially, CD3+T-cell depletion and cytokine neutralization abolished this protection, confirming the T-cell-dependent protective efficacy of XJ104. These results establish that enhancing the endogenous T-cell function represents an effective strategy against invasive candidiasis. In conclusion, our study presents a novel therapeutic approach that bridges T cells andCandidapathogens, promoting robustCandida-specific immunity and controlling invasive infections caused byCandida spp. These findings underscore the potential of XJ104 as a clinically promising immunotherapy for the treatment of invasive candidiasis.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium (S.Typhimurium) is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that grows within a specialized membrane-bound compartment known as theSalmonella-containing vacuole (SCV). The molecular composition and regulatory mechanisms governing SCV dynamics remain incompletely understood. In this study, we employed proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) to analyze the SCV proteome during infection. For this, we targeted the UltraID biotin ligase to the SCV by fusing it to a type 3 secreted effector. We demonstrate that the bacteria express and translocate the effector-UltraID fusion protein directly into host cells for labeling of the cytosolic face of the SCV surface. Proteomic analysis of biotinylated proteins revealed previously undescribed proteins associated with the SCV, including regulators of vesicular trafficking, cellular metabolism and lipid transport. Among these, VPS13C, a lipid transporter and membrane contact site protein, was identified as a critical regulator of SCV morphology and fission. Functional studies revealed that VPS13C also promotes ER-SCV contact formation, controls SCV positioning in host cells, and facilitates cell-to-cell spread by the bacteria. Together, our findings highlight the utility of BioID as a tool to study host-pathogen interactions in the context of infection and characterize VPS13C as a novel modulator of the intracellular life cycle ofS.Typhimurium.",

Pathogenesis inK. pneumoniaeis attributed to a range of largely horizontally-acquired virulence or fitness factors that collectively mediate immune evasion, attachment, intermicrobial competition and nutrition in different niches within the host. An outstanding research question is how expression of these factors is coordinated during infection, and how this regulatory control varies in genomically distinct lineages. Here we review recent progress in understanding the regulators and networks that controlK. pneumoniaevirulence or host fitness factor expression, discuss the role of plasmid–chromosome regulatory crosstalk in pathogenesis, and explore the potential of new global approaches to enhance our understanding.

    "abstract": "Influenza D virus (IDV) utilizes bovines as a primary reservoir causing periodical spillover to pigs and other hosts. In this study, we utilized ferrets to study IDV with a focus on the role of the Hemagglutinin-Esterase-Fusion (HEF) protein in the replication, tissue tropism, and transmission of two dominant clades of IDV– swine D/OK, and bovine D/660. In addition to swine D/OK, we rescued a chimeric virus (D/OK660HEF) expressing the bovine D/660 HEF using reverse genetic system. Two isogenic IDVs differing only in the HEF protein were characterized in ferrets with respect to viral shedding, tissue tropism, transmission, and pathogenesis. Ferrets intranasally infected with D/OK and D/OK660HEFshowed similar levels of viral shedding but exhibited slight differences in transmission efficiency to contact sentinel ferrets. Specifically, D/OK replicated mostly in the upper respiratory tract and transmitted to 2/3 naive ferrets, while D/OK660HEFreplicated in both upper and lower respiratory tract (trachea) but transmitted only to 1/3 naive ferrets. Both direct inoculated and contact sentinel ferrets seroconverted at 14 days post-infection, which indicated an association with viral replication fitness and transmission efficiency. Distinct receptor fine specificities plus six amino acid mutations in the receptor binding domain of the HEF protein between swine D/OK and bovine D/660 viruses may explain the different tissue tropism and transmission efficiency observed between these two viruses. Furthermore, while no detectable virus titers were observed in the lungs and intestines of ferrets, fluorescent RNAscope probe-basedin-situhybridization assay detected viral RNAs in these tissues. Finally, deep-sequencing revealed ferret-adapted mutations in PB1, PB2, and M segments that have not appeared in natural IDV isolates from bovines or pigs which need further characterization. Taken together, results of this study demonstrate that IDV is optimized for replication and spread in mammals and subtle mutations in HEF protein may affect viral tropism and transmission efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Single-round infectious rotavirus, which lacks a gene essential for virion assembly, serves not only as a safe and effective rotavirus vaccine but also as an orally-administrable viral vector vaccine that induces mucosal immunity. Previously, we generated a single-round infectious rotavirus by partially deleting the viral VP6 gene, and demonstrated its potential as a promising vaccine platform. However, this system has several limitations; namely, low viral protein expression levels and safety concerns. Here, we addressed these challenges by introducing large deletions into the VP7 or VP4 genes, which are dispensable for viral protein expression but essential for virion assembly. These VP7- or VP4-defective viruses exhibited markedly higher protein expression in wild-type MA104 cells than the previously developed VP6-defective virus. In addition, the large deletions reduce the risk of viral reversion, thereby increasing both efficacy and safety. In a mouse model, these viruses induced neutralizing antibodies at levels comparable with those elicited by wild-type rotavirus, indicating their potential as rotavirus vaccines. Moreover, a VP4-defective rotavirus harboring a heterologous gene achieved high expression of heterologous proteins, warranting its application as a viral vector vaccine. To further increase safety, we established a reverse genetics system for the bovine rotavirus WC3 strain, a parental strain of the licensed live attenuated rotavirus vaccine, and successfully generated a single-round VP4-defective rotavirus based on the WC3 backbone. Taken together, these optimizations facilitate development of safe and effective single-round infectious rotavirus platforms suitable for human use.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, neuromuscular synapses rely on clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in the muscle plasma membrane, ensuring optimal stimulation by motor neuron-released acetylcholine neurotransmitter. This clustering depends on a complex pathway based on alternative splicing ofAgrinpre-mRNAs by the RNA-binding proteins Nova1/2. Neuron-specific expression of Nova1/2 ensures the inclusion of small “Z” exons inAgrin, resulting in a neural-specific form of this extracellular proteoglycan carrying a short peptide motif that is required for binding to Lrp4 receptors on the muscle side, which in turn stimulate AChR clustering. Here we show that this intricate pathway is remarkably conserved inCiona robusta,a non-vertebrate chordate in the tunicate subphylum. We use in vivo tissue-specific CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis and heterologous “minigene” alternative splicing assays in cultured mammalian cells to show thatCionaNova is also necessary and sufficient forAgrinZ exon inclusion and downstream Lrp4-mediated AChR clustering. We present evidence that, although the overall pathway is well conserved, there are unexpected differences in Nova structure-function betweenCionaand mammals. We further show that, inCionamotor neurons, the transcription factor Ebf is a key activator ofNovaexpression, thus ultimately linking this RNA switch to a conserved, motor neuron-specific transcriptional regulatory network.",

However, it remains elusive why organisms have evolved such an astonishing diversity of isoforms. Here, we show that fitness and immunity properties have driven the modern evolution ofDscam1isoform diversity. We assess multiple aspects of fly fitness in deletion mutants harboring exon 4, 6, or 9 clusters, respectively, reducing ectodomain isoform diversity stepwise from 18,612 to 396. All fitness-related traits generally improved as the potential number of isoforms increased; however, the magnitude of the changes varied remarkably in a variable cluster-specific manner. Correlation analysis revealed that fitness-related traits were much more sensitive to reductions in Dscam1 diversity compared to canonical neuronal self/non-self discrimination. We conclude that the role of Dscam1 isoforms in canonical neuronal self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination is mediated by a small fraction of all isoforms (<1/10), whereas a separate role essential for other developmental contexts and resistances, likely in fitness and immunity, requires almost full isoform diversity. Thus, fitness and immunity properties, rather than canonical neuronal functions, are the dominant drivers during the modern diversification of the Dscam1 isoform. Our findings suggest that Dscam1 diversity is closely linked to adaptation and species diversification in arthropods.",

In mice that lack ATRX in microglia, CA1 hippocampal neuron morphology and electrophysiological properties are affected, and the mice display specific behavioral deficits. These findings demonstrate that ATRX is required in microglia to preserve chromatin structure and maintain microglial homeostasis.

We confirmed a large overlap in the genetic architecture of continuous BMI and severe obesity phenotypes, suggesting little genetic heterogeneity in common variants, between obesity subgroups. Systematic analyses combining functional mapping, polygenic risk scores (PRS), phenome wide association studies (PheWAS) and environmental risk factors further reinforce shared downstream comorbidities associated with continuous measures of BMI and the importance of known lifestyle factors in interaction with genetic predisposition to SevO.

Utilizing mass spectrometry, we identified histone deacetylases 6 (HDAC6) or Aurora A (AurA) as binding partners of PEDV or PDCoV membrane (M) proteins. Immunofluorescence studies corroborated that the AurA-HDAC6 axis serves as a principal regulator of ciliary disassembly. Additionally, M proteins from all four CoV genera—PEDV, SARS-CoV-2, PDCoV, and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)—were observed to congregate at the ciliary base. Molecular techniques, including immunoprecipitation and molecular docking combined with molecular mechanics/generalized born surface area (MM/GBSA) free energy decomposition analysis, further revealed that CoV M proteins interact with both AurA and HDAC6. These interactions depend on conserved residues at the transmembrane-cytosolic junction of M proteins, essential for their binding to the AurA-HDAC6 axis. Mutations disrupting these residues significantly impaired the binding affinity, thus inhibiting the associated ciliary disassembly process. Collectively, our findings illuminate a conserved regulatory mechanism involving CoV M proteins across all four genera, contributing to ciliary disassembly during early infection. This work enhances our understanding of the fundamental interactions between CoVs and host cells, positioning AurA and HDAC6 as potential therapeutic targets for a broad spectrum of CoV infections.",

    "title": "Fish TOLLIP manipulates ATG5 for autophagic degradation of STING to attenuate antiviral interferon responses",
    "abstract": "While robust interferon (IFN) responses in fish are critical for viral clearance, dysregulated signalling can trigger detrimental hyperinflammation, necessitating precise immunoregulatory mechanisms. This study identified Toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP) as a pivotal negative regulator of IFN production in grass carp(Ctenopharyngodon idella). Upon grass carp reovirus (GCRV) infection, TOLLIP expression increases significantly in tissues and cells. Furthermore, TOLLIP overexpression reduced GCRV- and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C)-induced IFN expression, whereastollipknockdown increased the cellular IFN production capacity. TOLLIP subsequently binds and degrades STING. Further mechanistic studies revealed that TOLLIP degrades STING in a dose-dependent manner via an autophagy-lysosome-dependent pathway. Interestingly, autophagy-related protein 5 (ATG5) was found to interact with TOLLIP and reduce TOLLIP-mediated STING degradation afteratg5knockdown. In addition, TOLLIP attenuated STING-driven IFN activation and compromised antiviral efficacy. These findings demonstrate that fish TOLLIP plays a specialized regulatory role in antiviral innate immunity, balancing immune defence with homeostasis maintenance.",
