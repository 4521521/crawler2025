    "abstract": "AbstractThe multiprotein complex mTORC1 is essential for the increase in protein synthesis and bioenergetic metabolism that supports the proliferation of many cell types, including natural killer (NK) cells, which are important innate effectors of the antitumoral response. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of mTORC1 activation in NK cells by interleukin-15 (IL-15) and IL-18, which promote NK cell function and are components of a cytokine cocktail used to preactivate NK cells for cancer immunotherapy. Through genetic and pharmacological approaches, we showed that IL-15 activated mTORC1 through the PI3K/Akt/ERK pathway, whereas IL-18 signaled through the p38 effectors MK2 and MK3 in both murine and human primary NK cells. Both pathways synergized to promote NK cell proliferation and effector functions in an mTORC1-dependent manner. Moreover, both pathways operated independently of the inhibitor TSC and the activator Rheb, revealing a noncanonical mode of mTORC1 activation by cytokines. Treating mice with IL-15 and IL-18 in combination led to increased NK cell numbers and improved antitumoral activity, suggesting that this cytokine combination could be exploited to enhance NK cell potential in therapeutic settings.",

    "title": "Wild-type RAS signaling is an essential therapeutic target inRAS-mutated cancers",
    "abstract": "AbstractMutated RAS proteins activate downstream effector pathways (RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT) to drive oncogenic transformation and progression. Because RAS family members differentially engage these pathways, combined inhibition of both pathways is required to effectively treatRAS-mutated cancers. Here, we found that this was due to signaling contributed by wild-type RAS family members that activated an effector pathway that was poorly engaged by the mutant RAS family member. Wild-type KRAS and NRAS promoted RAF-MEK-ERK signaling in cells expressing mutant HRAS, whereas wild-type HRAS and NRAS promoted PI3K-AKT signaling in cells expressing mutant KRAS. Combining inhibitors targeting the poorly engaged RAS effector pathways with inhibitors targeting the mutant RAS resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity in a manner that depended on wild-type RAS expression. The farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib blocked mutant HRAS-PI3K signaling and synergized with MEK inhibitors inHRAS-mutated cells, whereas KRASG12Cinhibitors blocked mutant KRAS-MEK signaling and synergized with PI3K inhibitors inKRASG12C-mutated cells. Synergy was abolished in MEFs lacking all RAS proteins and in cancer cell lines in which nonmutated RAS family members were deleted. Our data highlight the critical role of wild-type RAS family members in supporting mutant RAS signaling and its importance as a therapeutic cotarget inRAS-mutated cancers.",

The blowout persisted for 112 days, releasing ~109,000 metric tons of methane into the atmosphere. Elevated air toxics and fine particle pollutant levels were also measured in nearby communities. We used California’s birth records and a quasiexperimental design to assess whether pregnant women living in affected communities during the disaster experienced more adverse birth outcomes than expected. Overall, the prevalence of low birthweight and term low birthweight were 45 to 100% higher than expected among women living in the affected communities whose late pregnancy overlapped with the blowout. The strongest effects were observed among women living directly south and southwest of the facility. Furthermore, we observed a dose-response effect, where the odds of low birthweight were highest among women living closest to the well and attenuated out.",

The molecular catalysts with precise structures are unique platform to decipher the electrocatalytic mechanism, but they usually suffer from low performance. Herein, we report a strain-optimized dual copper complex immobilized in mesoporous carbon, which exhibits remarkable ethylene (C2H4) Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 49.9% along with a multicarbon (C2+) product’s FE up to 65.2% at −1.19 volts versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Concurrently, the catalyst displays considerable stability for 15 hours at a full cell potential of −3.1 volts. The density functional theory calculation reveals that the strain effect imposed by mesoporous carbon regulates the neighboring dual copper sites in the electrocatalyst to decrease the energy barrier of rate-determining step (*COCO → *COCOH), thus significantly promoting ethylene production.",

Current approaches typically rely on interconnected modules, facing challenges such as large footprint, high energy consumption, and fabrication complexity.

The OECTC leverages the electronic wettability switch characteristic of conjugated polymers to convert sensed signals into a valve mechanism for controlling the release of chemical substances (e.g., drugs and neurotransmitters). This provides an all-in-one solution for synchronized signal recording and substance release for physiological modulation.

Here, we find a group of quasi-1D superconducting materials among hexagonal perovskite chalcogenides with face-sharing connectivity. Resistance and magnetization measurements demonstrate anisotropic superconductivity in compressed barium titanium trisulfide (BaTiS3) at a low hole carrier concentration of (1.6 ± 0.1) × 1021per cubic centimeter, with the highest superconducting temperature (Tc) reaching ~9.3 kelvin. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction indicates that the superconducting phase retains a hexagonal perovskite structure consisting of quasi-1D infinite titanium hexasulfide chains. Density functional theory calculations, combined with the observed decrease in the maximumTcfrom ~9.3 to ~6.2 kelvin upon substituting sulfur with selenium, suggest that electron-phonon interactions play a key role in the pairing mechanism of superconducting BaTiX3(X = sulfur and selenium).

Here, we developed a universal enzymatic O2scavenger composed of alcohol oxidase, catalase, and paraformaldehyde to eliminate O2within the sensor by converting it to water. Unlike other oxidases, alcohol oxidase exclusively uses O2as an electron acceptor, preventing interference with the electron transfer chain involving the sensing oxidase. We demonstrated the compatibility of this O2scavenger for calibration-free sensing of glucose, lactate, and creatinine in the concentration range relevant to human health. Without the O2scavenger, sensor readings were less than 50% of those under inert gas conditions. With the O2scavenger, the accuracy improved to 99%, even at low substrate concentrations. The general compatibility and performances of this alcohol oxidase-based O2scavenger unlock the full potential of oxidase-based biosensors for reliable point-of-use sensing.",

The advent of reconfigurable electronics, modifying its circuits after manufacture, has unlocked the potential for devices to perform adaptive roles as needed. However, the trade-off between the degree of freedom to reform its structure and electrical stability restricts its potential roles, diminishing the system’s significance. Here, we present a reconfigurable assembly of magnetic nanoparticles in a phase transitional matrix (RAMP) system capable of seamlessly transforming their structure with robust electrical junctions. Nanoparticles form conductive percolation under a precisely patterned magnetic field. Within a phase transitional matrix, junctions between nanoparticles are tightened, enhancing electrical performance during transitions. We demonstrated in situ electrical switching and high-resolution alternating current electroluminescence display using the RAMP system. With enhanced reconfigurability and electrical reliability, we anticipate that the RAMP system will suggest a previously unexplored approach to on-demand electronics.",

We design a two-dimensional lattice of 261 coupled silicon nitride ring resonators that supports nested mode-locked states with fast (≈1 terahertz) single-ring and slow (≈3 gigahertz) topological super-ring timescales. We observe clear signatures of multi-timescale mode locking, including a quadratic distribution of pump noise across both azimuthal mode families, consistent with theory. These findings are supported by near-transform–limited repetition beats and the emergence of periodic temporal patterns on the slow timescale. The edge-confined states show distinct dynamics from bulk and single-ring modes, enabling clear identification. Our results establish topological frequency combs as a robust platform for independently tunable, lattice-scale synchronization, opening new directions for exploring the interplay of nonlinearity and topology in integrated photonics.",

In contrast, agents that decelerate relaxation were hitherto unknown. Such agents are highly desirable for metabolic imaging with hyperpolarized tracers such as15N-pyridine, 1,4-13C2-succinate, and 1-15N-nicotinamide, where valuable polarization decays rapidly, especially at low fields during transfer between polarizer and scanner. Here, we report on a previously unrecognized effect in which the tracers’ longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates in aqueous solution are substantially reduced by adding nicotinamide, urea, glycerol, or dendrons. The impact on longitudinal relaxation is particularly pronounced at low magnetic fields and near the tracer’s pKawhereT1can be tripled. This mitigates polarization loss during transfer, so hitherto unsuitable, fast-relaxing molecules can be used now. This way, we achieved the15N hyperpolarization of nearly 30% for 1-15N-nicotinamide. This chemically induced deceleration of nuclear spin relaxation (CIDER) was confirmed using magnetic field–cycling experiments and offers broad potential for hyperpolarized magnetic resonance and beyond.",

Tachykinins contract the visceral muscles, particularly the P4 pump of the foregut, and suppress myosuppressin release from pars intercerebralis neurons, thereby promoting crop motility. We further demonstrate the conservation of key genes involved in mammalian vomiting regulation. Overall, this study provides a molecular and cellular framework for understanding vomiting and introducesDrosophilaas a genetic model for mechanistic studies.",

    "title": "Bi-handed assembly chaperones regulate protein complex assembly through an intramolecular handover mechanism",
    "abstract": "AbstractA critical yet challenging step in protein complex assembly is the formation of a dimeric intermediate that serves as a seed for incorporating additional subunits. We hypothesized that this step could be facilitated by “bi-handed” chaperones that recognize two different subunits through distinct domains (hands). However, whether such chaperones exist remained unknown. Here, we identify AAGAB as a bona fide bi-handed chaperone. AAGAB uses its C-terminal domain (CTD) to bind the α subunit and its GTPase-like domain (GD) to bind the σ2 subunit of the AP2 adaptor complex, a central player in membrane trafficking. AAGAB first recruits α via its CTD; σ2 then joins through interaction with α, forming a conformationally immature α:σ2 hemicomplex at the CTD. This hemicomplex is subsequently transferred to the GD via a GD:σ2 binding interface, accompanied by conformational maturation. These findings establish AAGAB as the founding member of a bi-handed chaperone family and reveal an intramolecular handover mechanism that underlies their mode of action.",

    "title": "Temporal biphasic regulation of photoreceptor degeneration by microglial TREM2: A metabolic-immune nexus in retinitis pigmentosa",
    "abstract": "AbstractRetinitis pigmentosa (RP), the leading cause of inherited blindness, lacks therapies because of undefined photoreceptor degeneration mechanisms. While microglia/myeloid cells drive RP progression, their phenotype-regulating determinants remain unclear. Using rd10 mice, we reveal TREM2 as a biphasic RP regulator via STAT2–mediated microglial reprogramming. Early TREM2 loss amplifies neuroinflammation through STAT2 hyperactivation, while late deficiency triggers NF-κB/STAT2–driven microglial apoptosis, impairing phagocytosis yet preserving photoreceptors. We uncover a photoreceptor-microglia metabolic axis where apoptotic photoreceptors release arachidonic acid, salicylic acid, and creatinine to induce STAT2-dependent apoptosis in TREM2-deficient cells. Crucially, we identify intermicroglia PSAP/GPR37 signaling as a self-propagating apoptotic mechanism—the first evidence of apoptotic transmission in retinal degeneration. This study establishes three advances: (i) TREM2 exhibits stage-dependent neuroprotective/neurotoxic roles, (ii) photoreceptor metabolites dictate microglia/myeloid cell fate via STAT2, and (iii) microglial apoptosis spreads through membrane signaling complexes. Our findings redefine neuroimmune dynamics in retinal degeneration, propose chronotherapeutic TREM2 targeting, and extend to Alzheimer’s and other microglia-associated CNS disorders via metabolic-immune interplay.",

    "title": "RNA binding protein DDX3X drives pancreatic cancer progression via the TLE2-MYL9 axis",
    "abstract": "AbstractCurrent treatments for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) fall short of meeting clinical needs, highlighting the urgent need for a comprehensive understanding of PDAC progression, which involves not only biochemical signals but also essential biomechanical cues. Here, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 screen in an orthotopic xenograft model to explore PDAC dynamics. The RNA binding protein DEAD-box helicase 3X-linked (DDX3X) was identified as a pivotal oncogene and biomechanical checkpoint. Specifically, DDX3X up-regulation in PDAC promoted tumorigenesis and metastasis, primarily through the transcriptional repressor TLE family member 2 (TLE2). Dysregulation of DDX3X in the tumor destabilized TLE2 messenger RNA and therefore disrupted the interaction with KLF4 (KLF transcription factor 4), leading to increased expression of myosin light chain 9 (MYL9). This change remodeled F-actin, enhancing tumor cell traction forces and consequently facilitating tumor metastasis. Targeting the DDX3X-TLE2-MYL9 pathway considerably reduces PDAC progression. This research reveals a promising approach for treating PDAC by focusing on biomechanical cues.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPosttranslational protein modifications have emerged as a mechanism regulating progenitor cell state transitions during tissue formation. Herein, we exploit the stereotyped hair follicle development to delineate the function of PADI4, an enzyme converting peptidylarginine to citrulline. Single-cell sequencing placesPadi4in both progenitor and differentiated hair lineage cells and indicates that PADI4 acts to repress transcription during hair follicle development. We establish PADI4 as a negative regulator of proliferation, acting on LEF1-positive hair shaft committed progenitor cells. Mechanistically, PADI4 citrullinates proteins associated with mRNA processing and ribosomal biogenesis, and lack of PADI4 promotes protein synthesis and ribosomal RNA transcription in vivo. Characterizing key translational effectors, we demonstrate that PADI4 citrullinates the translational repressor 4E-BP1 and reveal a cross-talk between PADI4 activity and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. This work sheds light on how posttranslational modifications affect progenitor cell states and tissue formation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAdoptive transfer studies of ex vivo–expanded autologous cytomegalovirus (CMV)–specific CD8+T lymphocytes (CTLs) in immunocompromised hosts demonstrate a central role for viral control, but this therapeutic approach is not generally feasible. We present T cell–redirecting bispecific antibodies (TRBAs) that cross-link CD3ε on CTLs to gH protein on CMV-infected cells, including versions where a single-chain antibody is appended to the carboxyl terminus of the heavy chain of a regular antibody, or where both light and heavy chains have two tandem variable regions in a crossover ordered design. Both versions bind both antigens and mediate the specific clearance of infected cells with the release of interferon-γ when added to CTLs with CMV-infected cells. TRBA-mediated clearance is visualized with physical clustering of CTLs with CMV-infected cells. These results illustrate the mechanism and utility of these TRBAs as potential therapeutic candidates for disseminated CMV infection, with potential advantages compared to two prior CMV-specific TRBAs.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe kinetochore corona, a polymeric fibrous structure, facilitates chromosome biorientation and mitotic checkpoint signaling during mitosis. How its main building block, the ROD-Zwilch-ZW10 (RZZ) complex, assembles on the outer kinetochore remains poorly understood. Harnessing corona biochemical reconstitutions and cell biology, we reveal that the paralogous spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) proteins BUB1 and BUBR1 promote nonredundant branches of corona assembly. MPS1 kinase–dependent kinetochore docking of BUB1 and subsequent recruitment of BUBR1 initiates assembly. Disrupting the first branch by depleting CENP-E, a kinesin that links BUBR1 to RZZ, uncovered a second assembly pathway mediated by a direct interaction between BUB1 and ROD. Discovery of a direct interaction with the RZZ explains how the SAC protein MAD1 fits this corona assembly scheme. Our findings solve the long-standing puzzle of corona assembly and demonstrate the intimate interweaving of chromosome biorientation and checkpoint signaling.",

    "title": "Elucidating the mechanism by which HIV-1 nucleocapsid mutations confer resistance to integrase strand transfer inhibitors",
    "abstract": "AbstractPersons with HIV (PWH) receiving integrase (IN) strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) have been reported to experience virologic failure (VF) in the absence of resistance mutations in IN. We previously reported that mutations in the viral nucleocapsid (NC) are selected in the presence of the INSTI dolutegravir (DTG). Here, we show that these NC mutations accelerate the kinetics of viral DNA integration, suggesting that they limit the window of time available for INSTIs to block viral DNA integration. We find that in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, HIV-1 acquires mutations in the viral envelope glycoprotein, NC, and occasionally IN during selection for INSTI resistance. Notably, the selected NC and IN mutations act in concert to reduce the susceptibility of the virus to INSTIs. These results provide insights into the mechanism by which HIV-1 escapes the inhibitory activity of INSTIs and underscore the importance of genotypic analysis outside IN in PWH experiencing VF on INSTI-containing drug regimens.",

    "title": "Metabolism-driven posttranslational modifications and immune regulation: Emerging targets for immunotherapy",
    "abstract": "AbstractThe interplay between cellular metabolism and immune regulation is central to immune function and disease progression, revealing notable therapeutic opportunities. Upon activation, immune cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to meet heightened demands for energy and biosynthesis, reshaping regulatory networks across epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic layers. Metabolite-derived posttranslational modifications (PTMs) serve as pivotal mechanisms integrating metabolic intermediates with immune signaling pathways. Beyond classical acetylation, diverse nonacetyl PTMs—including lactylation, succinylation, malonylation, palmitoylation, and myristoylation—modify histone and nonhistone proteins, regulating gene expression, protein stability, subcellular localization, enzymatic activity, and protein-protein interactions. Advances in mass spectrometry and bioinformatics now enable precise characterization of these PTMs, uncovering their broad roles in immune regulation. This review summarizes current progress in immunometabolism and explores future directions such as mechanistic studies, combination strategies, and clinical applications. Metabolite-driven PTMs critically connect metabolism to immune regulation, suggesting promising therapeutic approaches for cancer, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBone marrow–derived multipotent hematopoietic progenitors seed the thymus and generate early thymic progenitors (ETPs). However, the factors governing ETP formation remain poorly defined. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (scATAC-seq), we dissected the heterogeneity of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility landscapes in murine ETPs. Whereas Tcf1−ETPs exhibited higher proliferative capacity, Tcf1+ETPs appeared to be immediate, more robust precursors to T lineage–specified early thymocytes. Prethymic ablation of Tcf1 and its homolog Lef1 severely impaired ETP formation in vivo. Whereas ablating Tcf1 alone had limited impact, loss of both Tcf1 and Lef1 impaired transcriptional activation ofNotch1and Notch pathway effector molecules, includingHes1andHhex, accompanied by aberrantly induced B cell and myeloid gene programs. Acute deletion of both factors compromised Notch pathway, glycolysis, and T cell gene programs in emergent ETPs ex vivo. Thus, Tcf1 and Lef1 act upstream of the Notch pathway, functioning as prethymic initiators of ETP fate and intrathymic gatekeepers of ETP identity and T lineage potential.",
