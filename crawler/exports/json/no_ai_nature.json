    "title": "NLRP3 autophagic degradation disruption in melanocytes contributes to vitiligo development",
    "abstract": "NLRP3 functions as a critical intracellular danger sensor for inflammasome activation, playing a crucial role in autoimmune diseases. Vitiligo progression has been linked to NLRP3, yet its specific involvement in melanocytes of vitiligo remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that NLRP3 expression is significantly upregulated in the melanocytes of vitiligo patients and melanoma-Treg-induced vitiligo mouse model. Genetic knockout of NLRP3 effectively alleviates vitiligo progression in these mice. Our mechanistic investigations reveal that the downregulation of the E3 ligase β-TrCP1 in vitiligo melanocytes decreases K27-linked ubiquitination levels of NLRP3, which in turn weakens its interaction with the autophagy receptor NDP52. This disruption impairs the selective autophagic degradation of NLRP3, leading to hyperactivation of inflammation and pyroptosis in melanocytes, thereby accelerating vitiligo pathogenesis. Notably, melanocyte-specific knockdown of NLRP3 using lysine-proline-valine (KPV)-modified deformable liposomes (KPV-Lipos) carryingNlrp3shRNA significantly alleviates vitiligo development. This study elucidates the mechanism by which autophagy dysfunction mediated excessive NLRP3 inflammasome activation in melanocytes contributes to vitiligo pathogenesis, highlighting potential therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways for the treatment of vitiligo and other pigment-related skin diseases.Overview of disrupted NLRP3 autophagic degradation in vitiligo melanocytes. In healthy melanocytes, NLRP3 expression is upregulated when subjected to oxidative stress, along with an increase in the E3 ligase β-TrCP1, which enhances the K27-linked ubiquitination of NLRP3 and further strengthens its binding to the autophagy receptor protein NDP52, thus effectively suppressing the excessive inflammatory response. Whereas in the melanocytes of vitiligo patients, decreased expression of β-TrCP1 leads to downregulation of K27-linked ubiquitination in NLRP3, thus inhibiting its autophagic degradation. The persistent activation of NLRP3 in vitiligo melanocytes promotes the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and GSDMD. GSDMD-N subsequently forms pores on the cell membrane, which causes the release of IL-1β and results in melanocyte pyroptosis. In our study, we utilize KPV-Lipos withNlrp3shRNA to precisely knockdown NLRP3 expression in melanocytes and effectively alleviate vitiligo development, which provide a potentially promising strategy for the treatment of vitiligo.

The implemented biomimicry of slowly adapting and fast-adapting type II primary afferents, cuneate neurons with overlapping receptive fields and neuroplasticity, enable unsupervised learning in localizing tactile stimuli with an error lower than 10 mm, and two-point discrimination thresholds matching human psychophysical thresholds in the forearm. These results align with biological findings and offer a promising step towards the development of bionic systems, opening new avenues for both practical applications and scientific explorations of somatosensation.",

    "title": "A prudent planetary limit for geologic carbon storage",
    "abstract": "Geologically storing carbon is a key strategy for abating emissions from fossil fuels and durably removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere1,2. However, the storage potential is not unlimited3,4. Here we establish a prudent planetary limit of around 1,460 (1,290–2,710) Gt of CO2storage through a risk-based, spatially explicit analysis of carbon storage in sedimentary basins. We show that only stringent near-term gross emissions reductions can lower the risk of breaching this limit before the year 2200. Fully using geologic storage for carbon removal caps the possible global temperature reduction to 0.7 °C (0.35–1.2 °C, including storage estimate and climate response uncertainty). The countries most robust to our risk assessment are current large-scale extractors of fossil resources. Treating carbon storage as a limited intergenerational resource has deep implications for national mitigation strategies and policy and requires making explicit decisions on priorities for storage use.",

    "title": "Global geopolitics should not stall science — 5 ways to push back",
    "abstract": "Pressing challenges, from the climate emergency to pandemic preparedness, demand concerted efforts at the global scale. But the growth in the use of international sanctions since the Second World War1, although mostly targeted at economic growth and military capacity, has also affected science and scientific cooperation (see ‘Science, restricted’ and Supplementary information for raw data). Many nations have suspended publicly funded collaborations with the scientific institutions of several countries, including Iran, North Korea and Russia.Even when they don’t target science specifically, sanctions hinder cross-border collaborations by increasing bureaucracy, restricting exports of equipment and financial transactions, as well as skewing where research is done2. Sanctions can also evolve rapidly, and changes in international relations can be hard to foresee, making long-term projects — such as the monitoring of changes in climate and ecosystems — difficult to sustain.As academics focused on environmental hazards and science diplomacy, we outline five ways to help develop and maintain scientific collaborations in a world that is fragmenting geopolitically. We urge researchers, national academies, funders, universities, governments and intergovernmental agencies to work together to ensure that, when governments decide to deploy sanctions, the impact they might have on science is fully considered.Source:www.globalsanctionsdatabase.comSanctions stymie scienceWithin four days of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia more than three years ago, the International Science Council in Paris — although emphasizing that the impacts on Ukrainian scientists were the largest concern — was warning that measures against Russia could have important implications for Arctic research. This turned out to be true.These Gaza scientists are keeping research alive amid war, destruction and uncertaintyThesanctions imposed on Russiahave led to gaps in data underpinning global climate models3. Russia is the fourth-biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, and the country includes more than half of the Arctic coastline, making it one of the most important locations for monitoring changes in the climate. Funding and access restrictions mean that many Arctic data sets, such as those on wildfires, permafrost and animal migrations, are not being recorded. And even when data are collected by Russian scientists, they are often not shared with the wider community.As a result, many researchers arepivoting to other areas of the Arctic, such as Canada or Greenland. But this change in coverage leads to biases in the data available and limits the ability of scientists to observe environmental change3. For example, the International Network for Terrestrial Research and Monitoring in the Arctic (INTERACT), a European Union-funded project, has lost access to data from 21 Russian monitoring stations (out of a total of 94 in the region).Other fields are also affected4. In astronomy, for example, eROSITA, a German–Russian satellite observing black holes, was switched off in 2022, and CERN, Europe’s particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, hashalted collaboration with most Russian institutions.Lessons from North KoreaNorth Korea is another case in point. One of us (J.O.S.H.) has been working for 14 years with Earth scientists there — and saw at first hand how hard it can be to engage in research amid rapidly changing geopolitics and an evolving sanctions regime.‘Science saved my life’ — and it must save other at-risk scholarsFrom 2002 to 2005, Mount Paektu, a volcano on the border of North Korea and China (where it is known as Mount Changbai) showed signs of activity. It was responsible for one of the largest eruptions in human history5inad946. In 2011, North Korean scientists invited J.O.S.H. and volcanologist Clive Oppenheimer at the University of Cambridge, UK, tovisit and discuss the volcano’s unrest. Funds were sourced from the Richard Lounsbery Foundation in Washington DC, which focuses on science diplomacy.Many hurdles had to be overcome just to start the project. UK universities were reluctant to sign agreements with their North Korean counterparts, and it was hard to find out how to conduct financial transactions with and export equipment to North Korea. Help came from the UK Royal Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, both advocates for science diplomacy (see ‘The different facets of science diplomacy’).The different facets of science diplomacyThe interaction between science and diplomacy has historically encompassed three aspects.Science for diplomacy is theuse of science to improve international relations. Scientific engagement can help to build trust and understanding between countries; for example, work by one of us (J.O.S.H.) in North Korea represents the only active bilateral project between the United Kingdom and North Korea today. Collaboration in health and environmental matters was the focus of science-diplomacy engagement between the United States and Cuba, starting in 2014 (ref. 7).Then there is diplomacy for science, in which diplomats help to facilitate scientific projects by developing funding schemes, such as Horizon Europe, or by ensuring that scientific projects can be maintained when sanctions are imposed, such as those affecting North Korea.Finally, there is science in diplomacy, the use of scientific advice to underpin foreign policy. For example, government science advisers in foreign ministries can embed scientific evidence in foreign-policy decisions on topics ranging from climate-change mitigation to protecting access to sensitive research (seego.nature.com/3jcvmrd).In practice, none of these is easy8. Science diplomacy is entwined with national interests, and science can, at times, be used ‘transactionally’ as part of wider negotiations9or as a stick to achieve foreign-policy goals (seego.nature.com/45phmqk). The use of sanctions, in particular those that specifically target science, is one clear example. This led the UK Royal Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science toupdate their language: the more nuanced ‘diplomacy impacting science’ replaces ‘diplomacy for science’, to recognize that diplomacy can harm as well as help scientific collaboration.In 2012, the Royal Society signed agreements with North Korean and Chinese organizations on the researchers’ behalf, and the institutions helped to communicate the importance of the project to the UK and US governments.UK policy towards North Korea is one of‘critical engagement’. It condemns North Korea’s weapons-development programme, arms transfers and human-rights record, for example, but seeks to engage with North Korea in areas of mutual interest that can facilitate continued and consistent collaboration. In 2013, the UK and US governments decided that studying Mount Paektu would not violate the spirit of the sanctions. This offered a chance to engage in the science of a potentially large volcanic eruption, of clear interest for all sides.Even so, the collaboration was challenging to develop. For example, the UK government refused an export licence for induction coils, sensitive magnetometers that could also be used to detect submarines. The decision was a setback for a planned measurement of subsurface electrical conductivity, and the project had to be modified to a purely seismological one. In July 2013, J.O.S.H. was allowed to travel to North Korea with six seismometers and begantwo years of geological and geophysical fieldwork.Diplomatic support helped to bring UK volcanologists to Mount Paektu in North Korea.Credit: Clive OppenheimerHowever, a difficult situation arose after North Korea’snuclear test on 9 September 2016. A United Nations Security Council resolutionexplicitly forbade scientific collaboration with the North Korean state. This was just after the project’s first publication, which was led by North Korean scientists6, and an international conference hosted in Pyongyang designed to develop further studies of the volcano. These more-ambitious projects seemed doomed never to start.But the resolution had two caveats: it exempted medical exchanges from the sanctions, and it gave UN member states leeway to review scientific activity with North Korea and contact the Security Council when projects did not violate the sanctions. With the UK government’s support, the second approach allowed the volcanology research to continue — which it does to this day.Protect science and scientistsThe North Korean example shows that, with careful development, key scientific efforts can be maintained, even in the face of blanket sanctions. Collaborations with Russia continue where legal obligations demand it, when stopping the project would harm national interests, and in areas of science built around large infrastructure. For example,Russia is a founding member of ITER, the organization behind the nuclear-fusion reactor being built in France, and the Russian space agency isone of the operators of the International Space Station. And although CERN has decided to expel most Russian scientists unless they find new affiliations outside Russia, itmaintains some collaborations with researchersat the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, north of Moscow.",

    "abstract": "Like a spider web that flexes to compensate for a broken strand1,2, steel truss bridges, which are built from a framework of connected elements, can sometimes withstand the failure of a load-bearing component by activating hidden structural responses. However, predicting whether a truss bridge will survive damage depends on many interacting factors, from geometry to the way in which the elements are bolted together and the choice of materials. How a bridge has been used — or overused — and maintained during its lifetime also has an important role.Writing inNature, Reyes-Suárezet al.3report six ‘secondary resistance mechanisms’ that might enable these bridges to avoid collapse. By combining physical experiments on a scaled-down railway bridge with simulations, the authors show that a combination of flexing and twisting can safely redistribute the forces acting on a truss bridge after it loses a load-bearing element. The researchers’ findings offer a framework for designing robust bridges in an era of ageing infrastructure and environmental pressures.",

    "title": "Cas9 senses CRISPR RNA abundance to regulate CRISPR spacer acquisition",
    "abstract": "Prokaryotes create adaptive immune memories by acquiring foreign DNA snippets, known as spacers, into the CRISPR array1. In type II CRISPR-Cas systems, the RNA-guided effector Cas9 also assists the acquisition machinery by selecting spacers fromprotospaceradjacentmotif (PAM)-flanked DNA2,3. Here, we uncover the first biological role for Cas9 that is independent of its dual RNA partners. Following depletion of crRNA and/or tracrRNA,NeisseriaapoCas9 stimulates spacer acquisition efficiency. Physiologically, Cas9 senses low levels of crRNA in cells with short CRISPR arrays – such as those undergoing array neogenesis or natural array contractions – and dynamically upregulates acquisition to quickly expand the small immune memory banks. As the CRISPR array expands, rising crRNA abundance in turn reduces apoCas9 availability, thereby dampening acquisition to mitigate autoimmunity risks associate with elevated acquisition. While apoCas9’s nuclease lobe alone suffices for stimulating acquisition, only full-length Cas9 responses to crRNA levels to boost acquisition in cells with low immunity depth. Finally, we show that this activity is evolutionarily conserved across multiple type II-C Cas9 orthologs. Altogether, we establish an auto-replenishing feedback mechanism in which apoCas9 safeguards CRISPR immunity depth by acting as both a crRNA sensor and a regulator of spacer acquisition.",

    "abstract": "Steel truss bridges are constructed by connecting many different types of bars (components) to form a load-bearing structural system. Several disastrous collapses of this type of bridge have occurred as a result of initial component failure(s) propagating to the rest of the structure1,2,3. Despite the prevalence and importance of these structures, it is still unclear why initial component failures propagate disproportionately in some bridges but barely affect functionality in others4,5,6,7. Here we uncover and characterize the fundamental secondary resistance mechanisms that allow steel truss bridges to withstand the initial failure of any main component. These mechanisms differ substantially from the primary resistance mechanisms considered during the design of (undamaged) bridges. After testing a scaled-down specimen of a real bridge and using validated numerical models to simulate the failure of all main bridge components, we show how secondary resistance mechanisms interact to redistribute the loads supported by failed components to other parts of the structure. By studying the evolution of these mechanisms under increasing loads up to global failure, we are able to describe the conditions that enable their effective development. These findings can be used to enhance present bridge design and maintenance strategies, ultimately leading to safer transport networks.",

    "abstract": "Nuclease–helicase DNA2 is a multifunctional genome caretaker that is essential for cell proliferation in a range of organisms, from yeast to human1,2,3,4. Bi-allelicDNA2mutations that reduce DNA2 concentrations cause a spectrum of primordial dwarfism disorders, including Seckel and Rothmund–Thomson-related syndromes5,6,7. By contrast, cancer cells frequently express high concentrations of DNA2 (refs.8,9,10,11). The mechanism that precludes cell proliferation in the absence of DNA2 and the molecular aetiology ofDNA2-linked diseases remain elusive. Here we used yeast and human cells to demonstrate thatDNA2suppresses homologous recombination-restarted replication and checkpoint activation at stalled DNA replication forks. Loss of this control mechanism upon degradation of DNA2 in human cells causes recombination-dependent DNA synthesis and build-up of RPA-bound single-stranded DNA in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Consequently, DNA2 deprivation triggers the DNA damage checkpoint and invariably leads to ATR–p21-dependent cell-cycle exit before mitosis. These findings explain whyDNA2is essential for cell proliferation and reveal that replication fork processing to restrict recombination is indispensable for avoiding cellular senescence. Stochastic entry into senescence stifles the proliferative potential of cells following the expression of a Seckel syndrome patient-derived DNA2 hypomorph or partial degradation of DNA2, providing a conceptual framework to explain global growth failure inDNA2-linked primordial dwarfism disorders.",

    "abstract": "Ischaemic heart disease is an important cause of death in humans, and resupply of blood to damaged myocardium can exacerbate the risk of cardiac I/R injury. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play an important role in cardiovascular disease. In this study we investigated the regulatory role of circDhx32 in the progression of I/R injury. Cardiac I/R model was established in mice by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) for 45 min, followed by blood reperfusion for 24 h or 2 weeks. For in vitro study, neonatal mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes were subjected to hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R) assault. CircDhx32 was significantly upregulated in I/R-treated mice and H/R-treated cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocyte-specific knockdown of circDhx32 ameliorated the pathological outcomes of cardiac I/R injury including improved cardiac function, reduced infarct size and reduced release of cardiac injury biomarkers. The protective effects of circDhx32 silencing were also observed in cardiomyocytes after H/R. We demonstrated that ALKBH5 functioned as an m6A demethylase, removing the m6A modification sites of circDhx32. Reduced m6A modification inhibited recognition and bindingby the m6A readers YTHDF2 and YTHDC1, leading to circDhx32 degradation and diminished nucleoplasmic export under pathological conditions. Elevated circDhx32 inhibited the transcriptional activation of AdipoR1 by binding to FOXO1. Conversely, circDhx32 deficiency alleviated the inflammatory responses in I/R-treated mice and H/R-treated cardiomyocytes including decreased mRNA expression levels and release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β potentially through modulation of the AdipoR1-AMPK-NF-κB signaling pathway. In conclusion, ALKBH5 acted as m6A eraser accompanied by the m6A readers YTHDF2 and YTHDC1 to promote high expression and nuclear retention of circDhx32 under pathological conditions. CircDhx32 regulated the inflammatory responses to cardiac I/R injury by targeting the AdipoR1-AMPK-NF-κB signaling pathway, which competed with AdipoR1 for FOXO1. These results reveala novel mechanism underlying cardiac ischaemic injury, and circDhx32 is expected to be a potential therapeutic target for early intervention in ischaemic cardiac disease.",

    "abstract": "Temozolomide (TMZ) is an alkylating agent recommended as the first-line pharmaceutical for glioblastoma (GBM), but its efficacy is limited by the development of acquired resistance in GBM cells. TMZ resistance is regulated by multiple factors such as MGMT upregulation and metabolism reprogramming, its underlying mechanism still remains elusive. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) is a transcription factor regulating the metabolism of lipid and glucose, while histone 3 lactylation at lysine on position 18 (H3K18la) could promote cancer cells’ resistance to therapeutic drugs. In this study we investigated the role of PPARα in regulating H3K18la and TMZ sensitivity in glioblastoma (GBM) cells. We established TMZ-resistant U87TR, U251TR, and U118TR cells by treating the parental U87, U251, and U118 cells with increased dosages of TMZ until the cells could resist TMZ (200 μM). We found that in TMZ-resistant cells, H3K18la level was apparently upregulated accompanied by increased ECAR (extracellular acidification rate) and intracellular lactate levels, whereas lactate (20 mM) time-dependently upregulated H3K18la in U87 and U251 cells. We found that PPARα was activated by TMZ in U87, U251, and U118 cells, but was inactivated when the cells became resistant to TMZ. In TMZ-sensitive glioma cells, TMZ triggered PPARα activation by causing DNA DSBs-dependent p38 MAPK activation. The activated PPARα upregulated its downstream signal ACOX1, which not only inhibited lactate-mediated H3K18 lactylation by promoting ROS-dependent PKM2 downregulation, but also reversely enhanced PPARα activation through ROS-activated ASK1/p38 MAPK pathway. In GBM cells resistant to TMZ, PPARα and p38 MAPK were both inactivated, but H3K18 lactylation was obviously upregulated. Targeting activation of PPARα with gemfibrozil or GW7647 not only sensitized GBM cells to TMZ but also effectively reversed the acquired resistance of GBM cells to TMZ by suppression of H3K18 lactylation through upregulation of ACOX1. Taken together, PPARα contributed to TMZ-induced growth arrest in GBM cells by inhibiting lactate-mediated H3K18 lactylation, targeting activation of PPARα may be a new strategy to improve the treatment effect of TMZ against GBM.",

Indeed, no additional cell death was observed in H9 human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived CMs (H9-CMs) after treatment with 20 μmol/L of nutlin-3a, a p53 activator, for 4 days (Fig.1b). We thus tested whether activating p53 can selectively purify hPSC-CMs by killing non-CM cells. Various concentrations of nutlin-3a were tested for purification of H9-CMs from differentiation day 21 for a 2-day treatment followed by a 4-day recovery. As shown in Fig.S1, flow cytometry analysis showed that the CMs represented by CTNT positive cells were 60.84% ± 2.35%, 65.4% ± 0.19%, 80.9% ± 1.21%, 90.74% ± 0.56%, 93.46% ± 0.80%, and 96.12% ± 0.55% in the cells treated with nutlin-3a at 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 μmol/L, respectively.

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are characterized by progressive neuronal dysfunction and anatomical changes caused by neuron loss and gliosis, ultimately leading to severe declines in brain function. While these disorders arise from a variety of pathological mechanisms, a common molecular feature is the accumulation of misfolded proteins, which occurs both inside and outside neurons. For example, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is defined by extracellular β-amyloid plaques and intracellular tau neurofibrillary tangles. These pathological protein aggregates are often resistant to traditional small molecule drugs. Recent advances in proximity-inducing chimeras such as proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), lysosome-targeting chimeras (LYTACs), autophagy-targeted chimeras (AUTOTACs), dephosphorylation-targeting chimeras (DEPTACs) and ribonuclease-targeting chimeras (RIBOTACs) offer promising strategies to eliminate pathological proteins or mRNAs through intracellular degradation pathways. These innovative approaches open avenues for developing new therapies for NDDs. In this review we summarize the regulatory mechanisms of protein aggregation, highlight the advancements in proximity-inducing modalities for NDDs, and discuss the current challenges and future directions in therapeutic development.",

    "title": "Complexin 2 contributes to the protective effect of NAD+on neuronal survival following neonatal hypoxia-ischemia",
    "abstract": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a key coenzyme involved in cell metabolism associated with aging, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic disorders. We recently showed that NAD+therapy significantly improved neurobehavioral outcomes in neonatal mice after hypoxia-ischemia (HI), and bioinformatics analysis revealed that the expression of complexin 2 (CPLX2) in the injured cerebral cortex was significantly decreased 24 h after HI injury but could be reversed by NAD+intervention. In this study we explored the role of CPLX2 in the survival and function of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic cortical neurons. HI models were established by permanent ligation of the left common carotid artery in mice. CPLX2-knockdown lentiviral vector was injected intraventricularly on postnatal day 1 (P1); CPLX2 knockout mice were also used. NAD+(5 mg·kg−1·d−1, i.p.) was administered before HI surgery, thereafter once a day until sampling. We showed that NAD+administration significantly ameliorated the morphological damages and neurobehavioral defects, and elevated the seizure thresholds in HI mice. All the beneficial effects of NAD+were abolished by CPLX2 knockdown or knockout. In HT22 neuronal cells subjected to OGD/R, pretreated with NAD+(100 μM) for 12 h significantly increased the cell viability, decreased the LDH levels, and inhibited the ferroptosis evidenced by the changes in redox-related parameters including concentrations of Fe2+, GSH, MDA, H2O2as well as the expression of GPX4 and SLC7A11. CPLX2 knockdown in HT22 neuronal cells blocked the protective effects of NAD+as in HI mice, whereas CPLX2 overexpression enhanced the inhibitory effects of NAD+on ferroptosis in HT22 neuronal cells.",

    "title": "Microglial STING activation promotes neuroinflammation and pathological changes in experimental mice with intracerebral haemorrhage",
    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation, a significant contributor to secondary brain injury, plays a critical role in the pathological process and prognosis of intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Thus, developing interventions to mitigate secondary neuroimmune deterioration is of paramount importance. Currently, no effective immunomodulatory drugs are available for ICH. The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)−stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a recently identified innate immune-sensing pathway primarily expressed in microglia within the central nervous system (CNS) that has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various neurological diseases. In this study we investigated the role of cGAS-STING pathway in ICH. A collagenase model of ICH was established in mice. Brain tissues were collected on D1 or D3 post-ICH. We observed a significant increase in double-stranded (dsDNA) levels and activation of the cGAS-STING pathway in the perihaematomal region of ICH mice. Administration of a blood brain barrier-permeable STING antagonist H151 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly decreased cell apoptosis, alleviated hematoma growth, and improved motor impairments in ICH mice, accompanied by inhibiting the STING pathway in microglia, reducing production/release of the cGAS-STING pathway downstream inflammatory factors, NLRP3 inflammasome activation and gasdermin D (GSDMD)-induced microglial pyroptosis. MicroglialStingconditional knockout significantly mitigated ICH-induced neuroinflammatory responses, pathological damage and motor dysfunction. These results suggest that the microglial STING pathway promotes brain pathological damage and behavioural defects in ICH mice by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome and microglial pyroptosis. The STING pathway may serve as a potential therapeutic target for ICH-induced secondary brain injury.",

    "title": "The PIWI-interacting RNA CRAPIR alleviates myocardial ischemia‒reperfusion injury by reducing p53-mediated apoptosis via binding to SRSF1",
    "abstract": "Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury refers to the secondary damage that occurs when blood flow is restored to heart tissues and organs following a period of prolonged ischemia. This damage is exacerbated primarily through mechanisms such as oxidative stress, inflammatory responses and apoptosis, all of which can severely impact patient prognosis. PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) represent a novel class of small noncoding RNAs that play pivotal roles in regulating gene expression and cellular functions. However, the precise role and underlying mechanisms of piRNAs in I/R injury remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the role and molecular mechanisms of a cardiac regeneration-associated PIWI-interacting RNA (CRAPIR), previously identified by our team, in I/R injury. An I/R injury model was established in adult male mice. The protein levels of cleaved caspase-3, Bax, Bcl2 and p53 were assessed using Western blotting, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis was detected via TUNEL staining. Our study revealed that, in I/R-damaged heart tissues and hypoxia‒reoxygenation (H/R)-induced cardiomyocyte models, CRAPIR was upregulated 24 h after I/R and H/R but was markedly downregulated at 72 h after I/R injury and 48 h after H/R injury. In the I/R mouse model, agomir-mediated overexpression of CRAPIR alleviated heart dysfunction and reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis caused by I/R injury. Conversely, CRAPIR knockdown via an antagomir exacerbated I/R-induced cardiac dysfunction and increased the number of apoptotic cardiomyocytes. Mechanistically, CRAPIR interacts with serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1), triggering the upregulation of murine double minute 2 (MDM2) expression. The increased MDM2 promoted p53 ubiquitination, leading to reduced p53 levels. Furthermore, silencing SRSF1 or MDM2 attenuated the protective effect of CRAPIR against cardiomyocyte apoptosis following H/R injury. These findings suggest that CRAPIR serves as a critical regulator of I/R injury via the SRSF1/MDM2/p53 signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "The anti-HER2 antibody‒drug conjugate (ADC) DS-8201 presents new hope for patients with advanced HER2-positive tumors. Its clinical application, however, is hindered by serious adverse reactions and reduced efficacy following long-term treatment. In this study, we investigated the factors influencing the sensitivity of DS-8201 and developed effective combination regimens to optimize its therapeutic efficacy. We showed that HER3 upregulation diminished the sensitivity of HER2-positive tumor cells to DS-8201. We found that DS-8201 treatment activated DNA damage repair responses in BT-474 cells, in which the ATR kinase pathway induced the expression of the HER3 transcription factor FoxO1, leading to increased HER3 levels. This process was triggered by the payload component of DS-8201, the topoisomerase I inhibitor DXd, rather than the antibody. Based on this finding, we showed that combining DS-8201 with either a HER3-targeting antibody (SIBP-03) or an ATR inhibitor (BAY1895344) resulted in significant synergistic antitumor efficacy without substantial toxicity in vitro or in vivo. Overall, this study revealed that the ATR/FoxO1/HER3 pathway plays a critical role in modulating the efficacy of DS-8201, suggesting that combining DS-8201 with ATR or HER3 inhibition represents a promising therapeutic strategy for HER2-positive cancers.",

    "title": "Antiemetic drug fosaprepitant exerts anti-tumor effects against NSCLC by targeting FAK to inhibit AKT and JNK/c-Jun pathways",
    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Abnormal expression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is closely linked to NSCLC progression, highlighting the need for effective FAK inhibitors in NSCLC treatment. In this study we conducted high-throughput virtual screening combined with cellular assays to identify potential FAK inhibitors for NSCLC treatment. Fosaprepitant (FOS), a clinical antiemetic drug, exhibited a high affinity for FAK with aKDvalue of 4.35 × 10⁻⁵ M. The direct interaction between FOS and FAK was confirmed by molecular docking, molecular dynamics, drug affinity responsive target stability and surface plasmon resonance analysis. We showed that FOS (15, 25 μM) dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of A549 and H1299 cells by targeting FAK. The IC50values in inhibiting the cell viability at 24 h were 73.05 and 126.1 μM, respectively. Knockdown FAK reversed the inhibitory effects of FOS on A549 cells. Using RNA sequencing and Western blotting analysis, we demonstrated that FOS treatment led to downregulation of the AKT and JNK/c-Jun signaling pathways in A549 and H1299 cells. Importantly, point mutation analyses revealed that FOS primarily targeted the Y925 phosphorylation site on FAK. In A549 cells xenograft nude mouse model, administration of FOS (20, 60 mg/kg, i.p. every 2 d for 2 weeks) dose-dependently suppressed the tumor growth. Collectively, FOS exhibits significant anti-NSCLC activity both in vitro and in vivo by binding to FAK and inhibiting its phosphorylation, thereby blocking the AKT and JNK/c-Jun signaling pathways. These results suggest FOS as a novel FAK inhibitor for NSCLC treatment.",

    "abstract": "Recent investigations into the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine, along with studies on schizophrenia-related susceptibility genes, have highlighted the GluN2A subunit as a critical regulator of both emotion and cognition. However, the specific impacts of acute pharmacological inhibition of GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors on brain microcircuits and the subsequent behavioral consequences remain poorly understood. In this study, we first examined the effects of MPX-004, a selective GluN2A NMDA receptor inhibitor, on behavior within the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Local administration of MPX-004 in the dmPFC led to a reduced immobility duration in the forced swim test, an acute antidepressant-like effect, impairments in sensorimotor gating, and a schizophrenia-like phenotype. In vivo multiple-channel recordings and c-Fos staining revealed that MPX-004 decreases the activity of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV-INs) and increases the activity of pyramidal neurons (PYNs). In vivo patch-clamp recordings further confirmed that PV-IN inactivation leads to an elevated PYN firing rate in the PFC. In vitro whole-cell recordings demonstrated that PV-INs receive stronger excitatory synaptic input and respond more robustly to presynaptic stimulation than do somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs) and PYNs, rendering them susceptible to GluN2A inhibition. Finally, the specific knockdown of GluN2A in prefrontal PV-INs abolished the behavioral effects of MPX-004, underscoring a critical role of the GluN2A-mediated modulation of PV-INs in these phenotypes. Together, these findings reveal that PV-INs are particularly vulnerable to GluN2A inhibition, leading to disinhibition of prefrontal circuits and resulting in both antidepressant-like and schizophrenia-like behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapeutic resistance is a significant issue in the treatment of breast cancer, which is related to pyroptosis inhibition. Increasing evidence suggests that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to tumorigenesis and drug resistance. In this study we investigated the role of the lncRNA STMN1P2 in doxorubicin resistance in breast cancer, as well as its correlation with pyroptosis inhibition. Our results showed that the expression levels of lncRNA STMN1P2 were significantly elevated in doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer tissues and cells. We demonstrated that knockdown of STMN1P2 reduced doxorubicin resistance in breast cancer cells; overexpression of STMN1P2 inhibited doxorubicin-induced pyroptosis by reducing the expression of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1 and GSDMD. Furthermore, STMN1P2 directly bound to and positively regulated heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNPU), and knockdown of hnRNPU reversed the inhibitory effect of STMN1P2 on pyroptosis and its ability to promote chemoresistance. In doxorubicin-resistant cells, hnRNPU directly bound to enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), and STMN1P2 enhanced hnRNPU recruitment of EZH2 and increased EZH2 protein stability. EZH2 acted as a transcription factor to inactivate TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), thereby repressing the binding of TRAF6 with MALT1 and caspase-1, attenuating the canonical pathways of pyroptosis. In MCF7/DOX cells xenograft nude mouse model, we demonstrated that knockdown of STMN1P2 significantly enhanced the suppression of doxorubicin on the tumour growth. This study provides new clues and approaches for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer chemoresistance.",

    "abstract": "Negative-stranded segmented RNA viruses (NSVs) employ a cap-snatching mechanism for transcription, which makes cap-dependent endonuclease (CEN) an attractive target for drug development. Pathogenic arenaviruses pose a serious threat to humans, yet no approved treatments exist, underscoring the importance of discovering novel compounds targeting arenaviral CENs. Therefore, this study aimed to identify novel CEN inhibitors for arenaviruses and investigate their antiviral mechanisms. A high-throughput screening system based on enzymatic activity of CEN was established for discovering inhibitors of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Several hit compounds were screened from a vast natural product library, and then evaluated for both toxicity and inhibition through cellular and animal experiments. One candidate compound was finally identified, and its mechanism of action on CEN was elucidated through simulation analysis and biochemical studies. Moreover, its broad-spectrum effects were investigated among pathogenic arenaviruses as well as representative NSVs. Consequently, salvianolic acid A (SAA) fromSalvia miltiorrhizawas identified as a promising compound that effectively inhibited LCMV infection and significantly reduced the viral load via intravenous administration. It was shown to bind to the active pocket of arenaviral CENs while chelating their metal ions through its acid carboxyl group, acting in a substrate-competitive manner. Additionally, SAA exhibited broad-spectrum inhibition of pathogenic arenaviruses as well as representative viruses from the orderBunyavirales. This study identified SAA as a novel CEN inhibitor, particularly for pathogenic arenaviruses, showcasing its promise for antiviral drug development.",

    "title": "Sirtuin 6 mitigates thoracic aortic aneurysm progression via maintenance of mitochondria homeostasis in vascular smooth muscle cells",
    "abstract": "Progressive loss of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is the pathophysiological basis for aortic aneurysm and dissection (AAD), a life-threatening disease, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), a class III histone deacetylase, is critical for maintenance of VSMC homeostasis and prevention of vascular remodeling-related diseases. In this study, we investigated the role of VSMC SIRT6 in AAD and the molecular mechanism. We showed that the expression levels of SIRT6 were significantly reduced in VSMCs of the thoracic aorta in AAD patients. We constructed a VSMC-specificSirt6deficient mouse line and found that loss ofSirt6in VSMCs dramatically accelerated angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced AAD formation and rupture, even without anApoe-deficient background. In human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs), knockdown ofSIRT6led to mitochondrial dysfunction and accelerated VSMC senescence. We revealed that SIRT6 bound to and deacetylated NRF2, a key transcription factor for mitochondrial biogenesis. However,Sirt6deficiency inhibited NRF2 and reduced mRNAs encoding mitochondrial complex proteins. Notably, MDL-811, a newly developed small-molecule SIRT6 agonist, effectively reversed Ang II-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in HASMCs. In a BAPN-induced TAAD mouse model, administration of MDL-811 (20 mg/kg, i.p., every other day for 28 d) effectively mitigated AAD progression and reduced mortality. These results suggest that SIRT6 plays a protective role against AAD development, and targeting SIRT6 with small-molecule activators such as MDL-811 could represent a promising therapeutic strategy for AAD.",

    "abstract": "Despite optimized guideline-directed medical therapy, patients with myocardial infarction (MI) often develop heart failure (HF) primarily because of excessive fibrosis. Bone morphogenetic protein 1 (BMP1) plays a critical role in the fibrotic process, yet its specific role in post-MI myocardial fibrosis remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the complex dynamics between BMP1 and fibrotic processes, offering critical insights for novel strategies to mitigate pathological fibrosis in cardiovascular diseases. An experimental MI model was established in mice by ligating the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. We found that the expression levels of BMP1 were significantly elevated in both the serum of MI patients and the cardiac tissues of MI mice. Administration of the BMP1 inhibitor UK383367 (2 mg/kg, i.p., t.i.d., starting the day of myocardial infarction modeling and maintained for 7 days) in MI mice markedly improved cardiac function, reduced myocardial fibrosis, and attenuated the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6 and MCP-1. Proteomic profiling revealed that BMP1 was associated with inflammation and oxidative phosphorylation pathways after MI. We demonstrated that UK383367 (250, 500, and 1000 nM) dose-dependently attenuated M1 macrophage polarization, protected mitochondrial function in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated primary macrophages, and inhibited collagen synthesis in Ang II-stimulated cardiac fibroblasts. Overall, these results reveal a pivotal yet detrimental role for BMP1 in driving myocardial fibrosis and amplifying inflammatory cascades after MI. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of the BMP1 inhibitor UK383367 as a promising alternative to conventional antifibrotic strategies, potentially curbing the progression toward HF.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are not only the most important organelles in eukaryotic cells that participate in energy metabolism, signal transduction, cell apoptosis and other physiological processes, but also essential regulators of neurodevelopment, neuroplasticity, survival and adult neurogenesis. The mitochondria-localized hydroxylase Clk-1 is involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis. Recent evidence shows that Clk1+/−mutant mice are resistant to morphine- and methamphetamine-induced conditioned place preference. Given the critical role of learning and memory in drug dependence, we herein explored whether and how Clk1 deficiency affected the cognitive processes in mice. We found that mutant Clk1 mice (Clk1+/−) exhibited recognition memory impairment in novel object recognition (NOR) and novel arm recognition (NAR) tests. In addition, we observed in Clk1+/−mutant mice a selective reduction in dendritic spine density in prefrontal cortex (PFC) but not in the hippocampus (HIP). The expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was also decreased in PFC but not in HIP. Furthermore, Clk1+/−mutant mice displayed impairment in the ERK/CREB signaling pathway in PFC that might underlie Clk1+/−mutation-induced changes in BDNF and dendritic morphology. Administration of antipsychotic drugs aripiprazole (0.3 mg·kg−1·d−1, i.p.) or risperidone (1 mg·kg−1·d−1, i.p.) for 7 days fully rescued Clk1 mutation-induced recognition memory deficits. This study provides primary evidence highlighting the role of mitochondrial Clk1 in the regulation of recognition memory and presents an informative model for investigating mitochondrial function in learning and memory.",

    "abstract": "Enteric glial cells (EGCs) play an important role in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) functions as a catalyzing enzyme targeting hydrolyzation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased PDE4 activity promotes excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in various immune and epithelial cells, exacerbating immune cell activation and infiltration in inflamed tissues, inhibition of PDE4 has been proven to be an important strategy for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In this study we investigated the pathological role of PDE4 and the therapeutic effects of a PDE4 inhibitor apremilast in IBS. 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced IBS model was established in mice, the mice were treated with apremilast (50 mg/kg, i.g.) for 7 days. After treatment, the intestinal motility and visceral sensitivity were assessed. At the end of the study, the mice were euthanized and the blood and colon tissues were collected for analyses. We showed that apremilast treatment significantly ameliorated IBS symptoms in the mice, evidenced by improvement on delayed intestinal motility and visceral hypersensitivity. We found that EGCs were activated in the colon of IBS mice. We then demonstrated that apremilast (10 μM) significantly suppressed TNF-α/IFN-γ stimulated activation of rat EGC cell line CRL-2690 and primary EGCs in vitro, as well as the secretion of EGCs-derived pain mediators and inflammatory factors while ameliorating oxidative stress. These effects depended on the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) signaling pathway, which was validated in Nrf-2 knockout EGCs. These results suggest that inhibition of PDE4 by apremilast suppresses EGCs activation by activating the Nrf-2 signaling pathway, leading to decreased expression of pain mediators and inflammatory factors while ameliorating oxidative stress, ultimately alleviating IBS.",

    "title": "Supervised toothbrushing: What oral healthcare teams  in practice need to know",
    "abstract": "ByAnna Hunt1,Samantha Watt2andZoe Marshman2 In March, the government announced an investment of £11 million, for 2025-26 to support supervised toothbrushing programmes (STP) for children aged 3-5 years living in the most deprived areas of England. The funding aims to support up to 600,000 children to undertake supervised toothbrushing and has been given to local authorities (LAs) who are responsible for the commissioning of oral health promotion programmes. In 2024, there was an estimated 150,000 children taking part from 90 LAs across England.1Additionally, the government announced a collaboration withColgate-Palmolivewho have pledged to provide 23 million toothbrushes and fluoride toothpaste over five years to support both supervised toothbrushing schemes and at-home brushing. Evidence fromChildsmile, the national child oral health programme in Scotland, suggests that supervised toothbrushing can be effective in reducing the prevalence and social inequalities in dental caries and is cost-effective.2The evaluation ofChildsmilefound that to reduce the prevalence of tooth decay children needed to be involved in supervised toothbrushing for at least 12 months with the greatest benefit seen when children participated for 36 months. For every £1 spent on STP, there is an estimated return on investment for the NHS of £3 over a 5-year period.2,3,4Improving children's oral health is a priority for government departments of both health and education because of the impact dental caries can have on young children's health, development, educational attendance and quality of life.5Supervised toothbrushing is included in the recent NHS 10 year plan6and the Department for Education's ‘Giving every child the Best Start in Life' strategy.7Dental health is already part of the Early Years statutory requirements.8Running a toothbrushing club is one way early years settings can show they are meeting this part of the curriculum and helping to support children to be ‘school ready'.9 Supervised toothbrushing takes place in early-years settings (schools, nurseries or childminders) where children brush their own teeth daily with fluoride toothpaste (1,350 to 1,500ppm) overseen by trained early-years staff. The whole activity typically takes less than ten minutes and is undertaken at a convenient time as part of the daily timetable. There are lots of ‘myths' circulating about children queuing for teachers to brush their teeth and schools needing to install lots of sinks. However, in most parts of the country, nurseries and schools use a ‘dry brushing' approach without the use of water, or a sink. Children sit on the carpet or at tables with their own identifiable brush and fluoride toothpaste dispensed onto a paper towel or plate. The brushes are rinsed and stored individually in specifically designed racks. Most early years settings use songs or video clips of two minutes duration to help make toothbrushing more engaging. This daily activity ensures an additional exposure to fluoride toothpaste as well as helping children develop their toothbrushing skills. Supervised toothbrushing is intended to supplement home-based toothbrushing undertaken by parents and carers. National guidance was published in April to support the commissioning and delivering of supervised toothbrushing schemes.10Supervised toothbrushing programmes are commissioned either by a single local authority (LA) or across a larger footprint with some funded by both LA and the NHS. The LA Public Health team and early years teams are involved alongside local Consultants in Dental Public Health who provide specialist advice to the STP. The STP provides the protocol for early years settings, training, support and a quality assurance process. Early years staff are trained by oral health teams employed by an LA or the NHS. Quality assurance takes place regularly to check that it is being provided in a safe and effective way. Oral healthcare teams have a vital role in advocating for and promoting the uptake of STP with families. Oral healthcare professionals should be proactive in discussing these programmes with children and their parents and carers, explaining the benefits of being involved. If a parent or carer reports that their child's early years setting runs a STP, but their child is not participating, the oral healthcare team can offer reassurance. They can explain that STP follow strict quality and infection control standards, and that participation offers significant oral health benefits, as shown inBox 1.For those whose early years setting does not currently offer an STP, dental teams can encourage and empower parents and carers to raise the issue with the setting. As a result of the government announcement, many LAs are looking to expand STPs, and parental interest can be a key driver in encouraging early years settings to get involved. Through these actions, oral healthcare teams can contribute significantly to increasing participation in STPs and improving oral health outcomes for young children.Box 1.  Practical tips for oral healthcare professionals to promote supervised toothbrushing.Questions for the oral healthcare team to ask children and their parents and carers:1.Have you heard about supervised toothbrushing in nurseries and schools?2.Does the early years setting they go to have one?3.Does their child take part?Benefits of supervised toothbrushing schemes:Prevention of tooth decay and its consequencesTeaching and instilling lifelong toothbrushing skillsEncourages and helps with home brushing. Parents of young children find a lot of resistance from children brushing at home and do report that when their children take part in supervised toothbrushing at nursery/school it makes the children happier to do it at home.Similarities and differences between brushing at home and at nursery/school:Similarities:Own brushFluoride toothpasteBrush for 2 minutesAn adult checks that they are doing it rightDifferencesNo mirrorsNo sinksBrush sitting down rather than standing upOften brush along to a video or song As described above, there are many stakeholders involved in STP who are key to the programmes being effective at reducing dental caries and to sustaining the STPs long term. Below, key stakeholders involved in STP share their perspectives.Jill Allbutt, Oral Health Improvement Service Lead, Shropshire Community Health NHS TrustI led the development of a supervised toothbrushing programme in Stoke-on-Trent in 2016 and I am now the Lead for an Oral Health Improvement Service in a Community NHS Trust which is commissioned by Integrated Care Boards. The service delivers a range of evidence-based community interventions, including STP, across four LAs. I work closely with the local Consultant in Dental Public Health who provides leadership to support the programmes and their ongoing development.At a strategic level I oversee the expansion and delivery of the supervised toothbrushing programme. This includes engaging with LAs, headteachers, early years leads and wider education and health partners to support settings and promote the benefits of daily supervised toothbrushing.Locally, I lead on the training and development of oral health improvement practitioners to deliver the programmes, and am responsible for planning the delivery, activity and quality monitoring, and rollout out of our local STP for 3-5-year-olds in day nurseries, mainstream schools, and 3 years upwards in SEND schools. The programme specifically targets early years settings serving the 20% most deprived areas. We follow the national guidance for supervised toothbrushing to ensure it is delivered safely, effectively and consistently and in accordance with current Infection Prevention and Control standards.I believe supervised toothbrushing is one of the simplest, most effective ways we can support children's oral health, especially in communities where tooth decay is still far too common.I have seen first-hand how a small daily habit - taking only 5-10 minutes in a nursery or school, can make a big difference, not just in oral health outcomes but in building school readiness and confidence in young children. For me, it is about more than just brushing teeth. It's about giving the young children the best possible start in life and helping to remove preventable barriers to learning and thriving.In our area the supervised toothbrushing has been well received. We have over 160 targeted settings currently participating and it continues to grow. We focused on making the programme as simple and practical as possible - providing clear guidance, ready to use resources, training that fits around busy school routines and promotional material to raise awareness of the programme. The success we have seen so far, I feel comes down to strong partnerships. Day nursery managers, early years leads and headteachers are often enthusiastic once they understand how little time it takes, how well it fits into existing routines and how much it benefits the children. Consent rates in settings are almost 100%.The programme is intended to be in addition to any home toothbrushing and many parents report their child being more willing to clean their teeth at home and allow their parents to help them, which reduces some of the stresses experienced when getting children ready for nursery/school or at bedtime.We are continuing to grow participation steadily and feedback from schools has been key to refining our approach. It has become a valued part of the wider work to reduce inequalities in oral health in areas where a high percentage of children starting nursery already experienced tooth decay.Victoria Major, Children's Health Improvement Coordinator, Herefordshire Public Health, Herefordshire CouncilMy role in Herefordshire supervised toothbrushing has largely been project management. I am the person who works with the early years settings delivering the STP. I have lots of oral health promotion experience in my previous roles in early years and family support; rather than a dental background, with oral health advice coming from the local Consultant in Dental Public Health.It has been an honour and delight to build this programme from scratch in 2021 with 0 settings involved to now in 2025 a total of 45 early years providers involved and enjoying the programme. Initially my role at the council allowed my full focus to be on children's oral health which meant I could learn more about the settings involved, build relationships and trust and then create an ‘offer' that was localised and fit the needs of our area. Our offer incorporates fun and creative ideas to maintain engagement with the settings and parents which is so important to keeping up momentum.Herefordshire is a highly rural and agricultural area. Compared to urban areas, while the number of children living in deprived areas may be lower, the poverty some families experience is still really significant. So families may be seen to live in large farm houses but their income is very low. Families also have to travel miles to get to an early years setting highlighting the importance of these settings to promote oral health. Knowing the needs of the area and the families living there has been vital to the success of the programme.‘ Improving children's oral health is a priority for government departments of both health and education because of the impact dental caries can have on young children's health, development, educational attendance and quality of life.'I have watched our STP grow from strength to strength and witnessed huge progression among the children. Something I always reiterate to settings is that supervised toothbrushing isn't a replacement for home brushing it's to encourage a positive experience of toothbrushing, it's about getting children to watch their peers, have fun with oral health, learn different techniques in a relaxed and positive capacity, this is to take the chore out of brushing!Laura MacRae, Teacher and Early Years Foundation Stage Leader and Abbie Smith, Teacher and SEND co-ordinator, St Nicholas Church of England Primary Academy, Boston, LincolnshireA lot of our children come to school with really poor teeth. It's heart-breaking to see the amount of children we've had in pain and agony, how can you learn if you're in pain? You can't! I remember one child who had to have all of his baby teeth removed, and the effect on his speech was so upsetting because he just couldn't talk. So, we feel it's a real big need for our children to get that extra brushing, or actually the only brush that they will have every day. Dental health is part of our curriculum. It is part of our science curriculum and part of relationships education, relationships and sex education and health education (RSHE). We have the educational side built in and the actual physical daily toothbrushing for two minutes and then we send the toothbrush and toothpaste pack home with them to make sure they have what they need to brush their teeth at home too. The Lincolnshire Smiles team come in at the start of each year to introduce the programme and then once every term to check we are doing it correctly.Parent of a 3-year-old girl attending a nursery in SheffieldWe had problems with toothbrushing to begin with and my daughter was taking food from her brother when I wasn't looking and she got hooked on sweets at a very young age. I was very gentle with her at first when she didn't want to brush, just giving her the toothbrush and letting her do it herself but obviously she wasn't doing a good job and she ended up having teeth out. It scared me! When she woke up from the anaesthetic, I've never seen her so angry, and blood was dripping from her mouth. Then she couldn't speak for a few days and her mouth was sore. It has taught me a lesson though that even when my child doesn't want something, it doesn't mean it's good for them. I will pin my child down and make sure they brush their teeth now. They have really encouraged toothbrushing at the nursery and I think it's really helped at home too. It would be nice to come in and watch them brush their teeth in there, we could pick up some tips as well on how to help brush their teeth!Jennie Ross, Associate Dentist, Richmond Dental Care, SheffieldWorking in NHS General Dental Practice I have had young patients come in really proud to tell me that they are brushing their teeth at nursery or pre-school and what they have learnt about doing it properly. They tell me about brushing for two minutes and making sure not to rinse afterwards. I have even had one parent tell me how their child now makes sure all the other family members are brushing twice a day too. Initially, I was not sure how the programme worked but I have now seen some videos online and learnt how schools and nurseries are able to integrate it into their day.‘ Oral healthcare professionals should be proactive in discussing these programmes with children and their parents and carers, explaining the benefits of being involved'It is great to hear that the messages we are giving families are being supported in other settings, and so regularly compared to the two to four times a year we would normally see children in practice. This is also being reinforced through dental nurses from our practice visiting local community centres, GPs or family hubs to discuss oral health and offer access to appointments at our practice, as part of a contract that has been commissioned locally. STPs are simple and effective at preventing dental caries in young children. While they require funding and stakeholder engagement to be successfully established and maintained, they can be integrated with other initiatives within early years settings to align with national requirements for early years education. The whole dental team has an important role to play in promoting STPs to their practice population. Dental professionals can contact their local Consultants in Dental Public Health for further information or approach their Local Authorities to learn more about STPs available in their area.More details about STP can be found at:https://www.supervisedtoothbrushing.com/.

    "abstract": "When I first started working in the dental industry back in 2006, the landscape looked quite different. It was standard for associates to be on a 50% split - straightforward, generous, and frankly not much of a negotiation point. Recruitment was relatively easy too. There was a steady stream of dentists looking for work, and principals generally had the upper hand. Fast-forward nearly two decades, and it's fair to say the balance of power has shifted quite dramatically.As dentistry evolved, so too did the web of compliance, regulation, and financial pressure. Remember the dreaded HTM01-05? That was a defining moment in modern dental compliance. Infection control protocols went from being good practice to rigidly enforced policy, and with that came mounting costs - for equipment, training, documentation, audits, refurbishments, and more. Understandably, principals couldn't absorb all of those expenses indefinitely.",

Employees have a statutory right to be accompanied by a TUR during such hearings, and they often exercise this right when formally invited.It is essential to understand the legal rights of employees in these situations. Under Section 10 of the Employment Relations Act 1999, employees are entitled to be accompanied at disciplinary hearings by a companion of their choosing.

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhite spot lesions (WSLs) is a caries lesion distinguished by white opacity due to subsurface enamel demineralization. These lesions resulting from a disparity between detrimental and protective factors and can continue to demineralize if untreated. Early diagnosis and remineralization can reverse WSLs, supporting minimally invasive dental care.AimTo compare and assess the color of WSLs through spectrophotometer after application of Self-assembling peptide P11-4, 2% Arginine Enriched Sodium Fluoride varnish and Functionalized Tri Calcium Phosphate Fluoride varnish.MethodsThis randomized controlled triple-blind clinical trial enrolled pediatric participants (ages 8–12 years) presenting with moderate caries risk as defined by CAMBRA (Caries Management By Risk Assessment) criteria, with visible white spot lesions (WSLs) on the labial surfaces of maxillary permanent anterior teeth, classified as ICDAS scores 1 or 2. A total of 39 WSLs were incorporated into the study and randomly allocated into one of the three groups 13/each. Group I: Self-assembling peptide P11-4 varnish (study group), Group II: Arginine-enriched Sodium Fluoride varnish (study group) and Group III: Tri Calcium Phosphate Fluoride varnish (positive control group). The color change ΔE of each WSL was quantified using a spectrophotometer at the baseline. Dimensions of WSLs were assessed by digital photography, remineralizing agents were applied then patients were recalled for further applications after 3 and 6 months and for WSLs assessment after 3, 6 and 9 months.ResultsAll groups demonstrated progressive color improvement over time. At 3 months, Group I showed the least improvement (ΔE = 16.39 ± 3.04), followed by Group III (14.80 ± 3.11) and Group II (14.06 ± 4.46). By 9 months, Group II achieved (ΔE = 9.37 ± 3.79), and Group III (9.15 ± 2.74) surpassing Group I (12.21 ± 3.03). so both Group II and III ultimately outperformed Group I in color correction by the study’s end. Group II achieved significantly greater WSL reduction (14.98 ± 7.55%) compared to both Group I (27.93 ± 8.98%) and Group III (22.32 ± 8.61%), with no significant difference observed between Groups I and III.ConclusionsAlthough all the three tested materials demonstrated an enhancement in the color and dimension of WSLs, 2% of Arginine Enriched Sodium Fluoride showed the best results followed by Functionalized Tri Calcium Phosphate Fluoride varnish, while self-assembling peptide P11-4 showed the lowest results.",

    "title": "Clinical and radiographic outcomes after pulpotomies using mineral trioxide aggregate mixed with distilled water or 2.25% sodium hypochlorite gel: a randomized controlled clinical trial",
    "abstract": "ObjectivesSodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) gel is an effective additive for white mineral trioxide aggregate (WMTA) that enhances its chemical and physical characteristics and significantly reduces setting time while maintaining biocompatibility. The study sought to compare the outcomes of pulpotomies performed in primary teeth using WMTA mixed with 2.25% NaOCl gel or WMTA mixed with distilled water (DW).Materials and methodsIt was a randomized, triple-blinded, split-mouth, controlled clinical trial. Forty primary second molars from cooperative children aged 5–10 who required pulpotomy were randomly assigned to the control group—WMTA  + DW or experimental group—WMTA + NaOCl gel for clinical and radiographic assessments at 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up. The clinical evaluation involved checking for spontaneous pain, pain on percussion, tooth mobility, abscesses, sinus tracts, and the exfoliation of the treated tooth. The periapical radiographic evaluation identified whether there was furcal radiolucency, internal or external root resorption, and widening of the periodontal ligament. Canal obliteration was not considered a failure.ResultsThe WMTA + NaOCl gel group showed a 90% and 95% clinical and radiographical success rate, respectively, at 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up. In the control group, the clinical success rate was 90% after 3, 6, and 12 months, whereas the radiographical success rate was 100% at 3 months and decreased to 95% after 6 and to 85% after 12 months. No statistically significant difference was detected between the two groups (p> 0.05).ConclusionsThe present research validated WMTA + NaOCl gel as a potentially effective material for pulpotomy in primary molars.",

    "title": "Enhanced anti-influenza virus activity of saliva following toothbrushing",
    "abstract": "ObjectiveInfluenza, a respiratory infection caused by the influenza virus, has been associated with good oral hygiene, which correlates with a reduced incidence of the disease. Saliva possesses inherent antiviral properties against the influenza virus. However, the relationship between toothbrushing, a common oral hygiene practice, and the antiviral activity of saliva remains poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of toothbrushing on the anti-influenza virus activity of saliva.Materials and methodsSixteen adults without oral disease participated in this open-label, single-arm study. Resting saliva and mouth-rinsed water samples were collected before toothbrushing. Participants then brushed their teeth with a toothbrush and toothpaste for five minutes, after which additional saliva and mouth-rinsed water samples were collected at five minutes and one-hour post-brushing. The total bacterial amount in the mouth-rinsed water was measured by qPCR. The anti-influenza virus activity of saliva was determined using the TCID₅₀ method.ResultsSaliva’s anti-influenza virus activity increased significantly five minutes after toothbrushing compared to pre-brushing levels, but no significant difference was observed at 1 h, as follows [Δlog, median (min-max)]: Before brushing: 0.625 (−0.25–1.75), at 5 min: 1.25 (0.5–2), and at 1 h: 0.75 (0.5–2). A correlation analysis between total bacterial amount and antiviral activity revealed a negative correlation.ConclusionsImproving the oral environment through toothbrushing enhances salivary antiviral activity. Maintaining oral hygiene may help prevent influenza virus infection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVirtual reality (VR) technologies are increasingly being adopted in dental education, particularly in restorative dentistry, due to their capacity to simulate realistic clinical scenarios and enhance student learning. However, despite the growing interest, the overall research landscape in this field remains unclear. This study aimed to conduct a bibliometric analysis to evaluate the most influential research contributions, publication trends, and collaborative patterns related to VR in restorative dentistry.MethodsAn advanced search of the Web of Science Core Collection (WoS-CC) database was performed on 29th October 2024 using a combination of keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms relevant to VR and restorative dentistry. Only original research and review articles in English were included. Bibliometric parameters such as citation metrics, authorship, institutional affiliations, countries of origin, and keywords were extracted and analyzed using Bibliometrix (R) and VOSviewer software.ResultsOut of 434 retrieved records, 62 articles met the inclusion criteria. A marked increase in publications was observed after 2019, with the USA, UK, and Netherlands emerging as the leading contributors. The most cited article received 73 citations, focusing on haptic simulators for motor skill acquisition. TheJournal of Dental Education, theEuropean Journal of Dental Education, andBMC Medical Educationwere among the most prolific journals. Despite global contributions, the analysis revealed limited interdisciplinary and international collaboration.ConclusionThis bibliometric study highlights the increasing research activity surrounding VR in restorative dentistry and its potential to transform dental education. While considerable progress has been made, further high-quality research and broader collaborative efforts are necessary to address existing gaps and fully harness the capabilities of VR and related immersive technologies in dental education.",

    "title": "Performance of nitric acid and mineral enriched system versus phosphoric acid and universal adhesive in cervical carious lesions: a randomized clinical trial",
    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo evaluate the clinical performance of nitric acid associated with a mineral-enriched adhesive system compared to the conventional approach of phosphoric acid and a universal adhesive in cervical carious lesion restorations.Materials and methodsTwenty-six individuals with 44 cervical anterior carious lesions were randomized into two equal parallel groups. The intervention group received a nitric acid etch(Clean and Boost dentin enamel cleanser, Vista Apex, USA)in conjunction with a mineral-enriched adhesive and a flowable composite liner(RE-GEN, Vista Apex, USA). Control group treated with phosphoric acid(Scotchbond Universal Etchant, 3 M ESPE), a universal adhesive(Single Bond Universal Adhesive, 3 M ESPE), and a standard liner(Filtek Supreme, 3 M ESPE). All cavities were restored using nanohybrid resin composite(Filtek Z350XT, 3 M ESPE). Postoperative sensitivity was assessed both qualitatively, using the modified USPHS criteria, and quantitatively, using a visual analog scale (VAS), as the primary outcome. In addition, clinical performance regarding marginal discoloration, adaptation, secondary caries, and retention was evaluated as secondary outcomes using modified USPHS criteria. Outcomes were assessed at 24 h, 6, 12, and 18 months. The data was statistically analyzed using intention-to-treat analysis. Intergroup comparisons were performed using the Chi-Squared test with a significance level (p≤ 0.05), and intragroup comparisons were analyzed using Cochran’s Q test with a confidence level of 95% and a study power of 80%. Relative risk was used to assess clinical significance. The survival rate was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier and Log-rank tests. The study was conducted following the CONSORT 2025 guidelines.ResultsBoth groups demonstrated similar performance in terms of postoperative sensitivity, retention, secondary caries, and marginal adaptation, as assessed using modified USPHS criteria. However, there was a significant increase in marginal discoloration within the phosphoric acid groups after 18 months. There was 50% less risk of sensitivity with nitric acid compared to phosphoric acid using the VAS scale (CI (0.2512 to 0.9953);p= 0.0485). The tested groups showed an equal survival rate (p= 0.3771).ConclusionCombining nitric acid with a mineral-enriched system is a promising approach for restoring cervical carious lesions.",

    "title": "Introducing flowable resin composite as a novel palatal dressing after free gingival graft harvesting: a randomized clinical trial",
    "abstract": "ObjectivesThis study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of using a flowable resin composite compared to periodontal pack in reducing postoperative morbidity after free gingival graft (FGG) harvesting.Materials and methodsIn this randomized controlled clinical trial, 34 patients requiring FGG were allocated into two equal groups. The intervention group received a flowable resin composite dressing over the palatal wound, while the control group received Coe-Pak. Postoperative pain was assessed using a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and mean analgesic consumption over 14 days. Secondary outcomes included wound size and color match of the healing site assessed at weeks 1, 2, 3, and 6.ResultsThe control group reported significantly higher VAS pain scores than the intervention group on days 1–4 and 10 (p< 0.05), and highly significant differences on days 5, 6, 8, and 9 (p< 0.001). Analgesic use decreased significantly in both groups (p< 0.001), with no intergroup differences. Wound size and color match improvements were comparable between groups.ConclusionThe application of flowable resin composite significantly reduces early postoperative pain following FGG harvesting without compromising healing outcomes. Its ease of application, patient comfort, and comparable clinical performance make it a promising alternative to traditional dressings. However, further investigations are warranted to confirm the biocompatibility of flowable resin composites and their impact on soft tissue healing.",

This analysis can be used on radiographic and non-radiographic images in dentistry. In this review we aim to identify the usefulness of fractal analysis in dentistry in radiographic images, its applications and future scope.Materials and MethodsArticles published between 1992 and 2024 were retrieved through an electronic search of Medline via PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. The search, which was limited to articles published in English, aimed to identify relevant studies by employing the following keywords: “fractal analysis,” “dental radiographs,” “mandibular,” “panoramic radiographs,” and “radiography.” Ultimately, 76 articles that addressed the application of fractal analysis in dental radiographs were selected.ResultsFractal analysis can reveal alterations in bone and in images of morphologically altered tissue, however no set values exist which could be used as a standard for diagnosing various conditions.ConclusionFractal Analysis can potentially be used as an adjunct to diagnostic tests as it is shown to identify alterations in bony and trabeculae patterns.",

    "title": "Discussing the various space-replacement treatment modalities possible following extraction of an unrestorable upper central incisor",
    "abstract": "Insertion of an acrylic immediate partial denture following extraction will aid socket haemostasis, and serve as an aesthetic, space-maintaining, and functional interim replacement while a period of bony healing occurs over three-to-six-months.1Construction of a permanent replacement will be necessary if a removable partial denture (RPD) is selected as the definitive treatment modality, and a chairside or laboratory reline may also be required during the interim phase. This is to account for the hard and soft tissue remodelling processes that occur following tooth loss, resulting in a significant loss of alveolar ridge volume.2Although more costly than acrylic and subject to the patient's periodontal health, a cobalt-chrome RPD employs a rigid substructure to gain support from both the hard and soft tissues, utilising rest seats to transmit occlusal loads down the long axis of supporting teeth.3Cobalt-chrome RPDs may also incorporate a gingivally-free design to minimise plaque accumulation, with no element of the RPD crossing the interproximal gingival margin in accordance with Scandinavian design principles.4Had it not been deemed unrestorable, elective endodontic treatment of the upper central incisor and its maintenance as an overdenture abutment could also be considered to provide proprioception for increased biting forces, improved denture retention, and contribute to maintaining the alveolar bone.Learning how to function with an RPD for processes such as mastication and speech can take time to develop neuro-muscular control for. Concerns regarding denture retention coupled with the psychological acceptance of wearing an RPD may be challenging for the patient.5Furthermore, studies present a strong relationship between RPDs and both root caries and gingival recession associated with abutment teeth, regardless of adequate oral hygiene measures.6Patient factors, such as a high smile line, also increase the difficulty of achieving an aesthetic result. Retention using ball-ended cribs on maxillary first permanent molars can avoid visible clasping of abutment teeth, and the use of an open-faced, or ‘gum-fit', design will conceal the junction between labial flange and mucosa, provided no significant labial resorption has occurred.7",

    "title": "Irrigation: The most important stage of endodontic treatment? A discussion",
    "abstract": "Historically, the cornerstone of endodontic success has been the achievement of a tight seal to prevent reinfection. However, in recent years, increasing emphasis has been placed on the role of irrigation. Many contemporary research papers in the field of endodontics have focused on advancements in irrigation protocols, materials, and associated technologies.1This volume of research highlights the pivotal role of irrigation in the success of endodontic treatment.Success in root canal treatment depends on a combination of factors: mechanical preparation, disinfection, obturation, and coronal sealing. Although the importance of irrigation cannot be dismissed, whether it outweighs all other factors in determining success is debatable. This discussion will critically appraise the research and provide a perspective on whether irrigation can indeed be considered the most critical component of endodontic success.",

    "title": "Give yourself  some  curing time",
    "abstract": "Coming to terms with the workload that life as a dental student brings can be a challenge and remembering that you need to balance a personal life with this is even more demanding. Being efficient whilst also being effective is a skill that takes years to master, both academically and clinically. The pursuit of success can easily lead to non-stop work, making careful balance essential. Relentless scheduling often leads to burnout, which is why tools like to-do lists (Todoist), paper planners and simply knowing deadlines in advance help keep track; whether you prefer to meet or beat them. Intertwined with being an academic weapon, it's imperative to plan for some downtime, because sometimes it's good to be busy… doing nothing.Achieving good overall well-being helps in many areas; a state of being both healthy and happy. Stress can be a good motivating force, but when it crosses a certain threshold, it can become harmful to well-being. Developing self-awareness and recognising when stress shifts from being productive to detrimental is key to maintaining balance and preventing burnout. This idea is further explored later, focusing on accepting the journey of development and rewards of marginal gains. Understanding the benefits of self-care, mindfulness and resilience is essential for dental students to navigate the demands of training.1Prioritising these helps maintain optimal mental and physical well-being, while balancing sustainable habits fosters long-term success and professional growth.",

    "title": "Breaking free: Empowering youth to overcome vaping and nicotine addiction",
    "abstract": "While the long-term effects of vaping are still being studied, evidence suggests that the chemicals found in vape liquids may pose significant health risks. Most vape liquids contain nicotine, propylene glycol, vegetable glycerine, and various flavouring agents.2When heated, these substances form an aerosol mist which can be inhaled into the lungs for nicotine delivery.At high temperatures, propylene glycol and vegetable glycerine breaks down into formaldehyde and other carcinogenic aldehydes. These carcinogens increases the risk of lung damage and may contribute to respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular disease.2,3,4What's more, nicotine exposure during adolescence can interfere with brain development, potentially leading to cognitive impairments, reduced attention span, and alterations in working memory.5Studies have also shown that nicotine can reduce prefrontal cortex activation, which plays a crucial role in decision-making and impulse control.5",

    "abstract": "Rebekah Martindescribes the importance of educating children about oral health early in their lives, and her activities visiting local schools and nurseries. When I began my dental nursing journey in October 2020, one of the first things that truly surprised me was discovering how many patients either didn't brush their teeth at all or only brushed once a day. Having grown up with the routine of brushing twice daily, I had assumed it was the norm for everyone. It was a real eye-opener - and it made me realise just how much work there is to do in raising awareness about oral hygiene.This realisation was reinforced when I came across the findings from the 2022 National Dental Epidemiology Programme (NDEP) survey, which revealed that 29.3% of five-year-olds in England had enamel or dentine decay.1That's nearly one in three children starting school already experiencing tooth decay - something that is largely preventable with the right education and habits.It was then that I realised I wanted my role to go beyond the dental chair. I felt a real passion to help shape healthier habits from the very beginning - starting with children. Reaching them early, before poor routines take hold, gives us the best chance of setting them up for a lifetime of confident, healthy smiles.Since then, I've embraced every opportunity to promote oral health education. As a dental nurse in the East Midlands with Bupa Dental Care, and in my role as the Oral Health Education Representative for the British Association of Dental Nurses (BADN), I've found a real sense of purpose in this work. Educating children about how to care for their teeth isn't just a job - it's a passion. The earlier we start, the more natural these habits become, and the greater the long-term impact on their health and wellbeing. One of the most rewarding parts of my role is visiting local schools and nurseries to deliver fun, engaging oral health sessions. These visits are more than just educational - they're interactive experiences designed to make learning about teeth exciting and memorable.Before each visit, we coordinate with the school to understand the number of children we'll be speaking to and the preferred style of presentation. For younger children, we keep things short and sweet with group chats followed by hands-on activities. For older students, we often deliver assembly-style talks that allow us to reach a larger audience with age-appropriate messaging.We usually attend as a dentist-and-nurse team, and we always welcome extra hands from our practice to join in the fun! One recent visit took us to Busy Bees Nursery, where I was joined by Dr Humzah Jessa and Leah Blakeman, a soon-to-be-qualified dental nurse. We had the pleasure of speaking to two groups of children aged two to four.We began by introducing ourselves and explaining our roles in simple terms. Then came the fun part - talking about brushing teeth and healthy eating through games and activities. One of the children's favourites was our ‘thumbs up/thumbs down' food game, where they guessed whether different foods were good or bad for their teeth. Cheese sparked some debate, which gave us a great opportunity to explain its benefits.We wrapped up the visit by handing out toothbrushes, toothpaste, brushing charts, and stickers - leaving behind a room full of smilesAfter our group talk, we moved into activity stations. The most popular? The ‘Dress Like a Dentist/Dental Nurse' corner, where children donned gloves, masks, visors, and even used real dental tools like mirrors and suction tubes (safely, of course!). Other stations included:Toothpaste Matching Game (thanks to Twinkl)Toothbrush Line TracingPlaque Brushing Challenge - where children used toothbrushes to clean laminated ‘plaque-covered' teeth.We wrapped up the visit by handing out toothbrushes, toothpaste, brushing charts, and stickers - leaving behind a room full of smiles. Another recent visit took me and my fellow dental nurses, Laura Burd and Joanne Bagshaw, to a local primary school where we presented to a reception class. The children were full of energy and curiosity, and it was a joy to see how engaged they were throughout the session. We introduced ourselves, explained our roles, and then launched into a fun and interactive talk about brushing, healthy eating, and visiting the dentist. The teachers were incredibly supportive and commented on how valuable the session was - not just for the children, but for reinforcing oral health messages already being taught in class. It's always rewarding to hear that our visits are making a difference, and this one was no exception. Last year, I also had the pleasure of being invited to my children's primary school to take part in their first career fair morning. I eagerly accepted the invitation, as it was a wonderful opportunity to not only promote oral health but also to inspire young children to consider a career in dentistry. The career fair was a great success, and I am looking forward to attending again this July.I'd love to see oral health education become a standard part of the national curriculum. Many schools don't realise that local dental practices are eager to support them with visits and resources. Back in the surgery, I continue to champion oral health by providing young patients with brushing charts, toothbrushes, and timers to encourage good habits at home. Many children feel nervous about visiting the dentist, so we do our best to make each appointment as enjoyable and reassuring as possible. We guide them through every step, offering the comfort of sitting on a parent's knee or holding their hand - whatever helps them feel safe. It's especially rewarding to see children who've been coming since they were babies now hop confidently into the chair. It's a clear sign that we're no longer seen as so scary. I truly believe that when children learn positive habits early on, they're more likely to carry them throughout their lives.I'd love to see oral health education become a standard part of the national curriculum. Many schools don't realise that local dental practices are eager to support them with visits and resources. It's a part of my job I find incredibly fulfilling, and I'm always encouraging others to get involved.One great way to do that is through Dentaid's Bright Bites programme,2which I volunteer for.

    "title": "Empowering patients to take control of their oral health",
    "abstract": "A structured, whole-person approach is the best way to promote oral health to patients, saysCheryl Goodenough. Promoting oral health has always been a key part of my career in dental nursing over the past 25 years, but over time, I've realised that lasting change comes from a structured, whole-person approach. At my practice in Gloucestershire, we have integrated aspects of the British Society of Periodontology (BSP) guidelines1into our patient journey, ensuring prevention, risk management, and education are embedded into every appointment. Our goal is not just to treat periodontal disease, but to empower our patients to take control of their oral and general health. The approach gives us a clear framework to follow, allowing us to deliver high-quality, consistent care. In every appointment, whether it's an examination, hygiene visit, or a follow-up, with a team approach, we use this structure to guide conversations, build rapport, and deliver targeted oral health advice. Patients benefit from understanding where they are on their periodontal journey and what steps they need to take next take to improve their oral care.©Oleksandra Polishchuk/iStock/Getty Images Plus As a dental nurse who is oral health qualified, I am lucky enough to be given my own clinic within practice. These prescribed appointments from our clinicians are bespoke 40-minute slots which allow me to build trust with patients and explain things in a relatable way. Using the BSP model, we now ensure that every interaction reinforces the message of prevention and selfcare.For example, when discussing staging and grading of periodontal disease with the patient, we use visuals in the form of PowerPoint slides highlighting stages of gum disease using simplified terminology, to explain what their current diagnosis means and how lifestyle factors like smoking, diabetes, or oral hygiene influence outcomes. Patients often engage more when they understand how their personal risk factors link to their gum health. We also explain the long-term benefits of stabilisation and helping them see that regular visits and home care are not just routines, but part of a personalised health plan.With challenges like misinformation online and stretched resources, the need for strong, structured oral health promotion has never been greater. Successful implementation requires teamwork. At my practice our dentists, dental hygienists, and dental nurses all play a part in delivering consistent, evidence-based messages. Our nursing sessions encourage and demonstrate the use of interdental brushes, brushing techniques and follow up on lifestyle advice like smoking cessation, diabetes awareness, and connections to other oral health conditions, all tailored to the patient's needs. We also make sure patients understand their responsibility in maintaining gum health between visits. Our patients have achieved many positive results and their periodontal conditions have stabilised, making these appointments absolutely invaluable. The guidelines help us move away from one-size-fits-all advice. By combining staging and grading with age-appropriate education, we personalise our oral health messaging:Childrenlearn through interactions and visuals, focusing on brushing technique, disclosing to highlight plaque and sugar awarenessTeenagersbenefit from understanding how gum health affects appearance and confidenceAdultsare supported with habit change, diet, smoking, and oral hygiene routinesOlder adultsreceive guidance on dry mouth, medication interactions, and general mouth care.We also consider accessibility, adjusting our approach for patients with additional needs or neurodiversity. With challenges like misinformation online and stretched resources, the need for strong, structured oral health promotion has never been greater. As a practice we use this framework to benefit all our patients, and we would highly recommend dental practices utilise their oral health trained dental nurses to implement a similar programme. Our programme feedback has been nothing but positive from our patients and the results speak for themselves. We have even been lucky enough to win the Impact Award for this programme from the Society of British Dental Nurses. Outside of the practice, we continue to promote oral health messages through local school visits with the support of Dentaid, educating our younger generations. Our appointments have become opportunities to prevent, personalise, and empower. Oral health promotion isn't just about telling patients how to brush their teeth, it's about helping them understand their risk, make informed decisions, and take charge of their own health.By working as a team, supporting each patient's journey, and reaching out to them, we can reduce the burden of periodontal disease and improve overall wellbeing one conversation at a time.

    "title": "‘When you work as an oral health promoter, you are in the driving seat'",
    "abstract": "BDA Education'sAnne-Marie Moisleyinterviews Sheryll, the student who wanted ‘to know the science behind oral health education' and was determined to wear the BDA OHE badge, to ask about her journey and how she achieved her ‘dream to become an oral health promoter'.©Dmitry Volkov/iStock/Getty Images Plus The British Dental Association (BDA) offers a nationally recognised BDA Education Certificate in Oral Health Education (OHE), which qualifies individuals to work as an oral health educator within their practice. Sheryll John-Vidot is an oral health promoter (OHP) involved in a variety of operational aspects of an oral health promotion team for three London boroughs. Sheryll qualified with the BDA as an oral health educator in November 2024.Sheryll John-Vidot Tell us a little about your background and your route to becoming an OH promoter.The first seeds were sown at a young age. I was 12 when I sat in the dental chair looking at the orthodontist and dental nurse working together to fit my braces, listening to the radio and also having a laugh, and thought to myself, ‘this would be a nice place to work'.My assessor from the dental nursing course recorded me giving oral health advice to a patient and said I should become an oral health promotor. At the time, I didn't know what that was, so they explained that I would see my own patients and give them tailored advice. This sounded good and something I hoped to do in the future.Once I had qualified as a dental nurse,  I secured a job in a private practice in 2006.Keen to broaden my skill set, I then secured a job in what went on to be an award-winning private practice for children. Here I had a more vocal role in providing children's oral health advice to their guardians and learned a lot from the dentists I was working with. But I wanted more knowledge in this area.Whilst working at the children's practice, I completed the BDA Education Certificate in Dental Radiography, which I found daunting at first, but really enjoyed. I also qualified in fluoride application. These courses helped me to feel more involved in patients' care.Next, I joined special care dentistry in a hospital. I enjoyed my extended duties working in the community, visiting patients in their homes and going on domiciliary visits. But something was still missing. I regularly asked during my appraisals about joining the Oral Health Promotion Team. Then one day a job came up and I was appointed to the position. I was so thrilled!Is this role very different to dental nursing?Yes, as a dental nurse, you take the lead from the dentist, but when you work as an OHP, you are in the driving seat. For example, if I attend a play group to give advice, there is no receptionist; I need to make my own bookings and manage my own diary. I need to make a lesson plan and take the time to consider what I want my audience to take away from our interaction. Instead of a mirror, probe and tweezers, I may need giant teeth, a giant toothbrush and some leaflets. Planning my resources is important.What prompted you to complete the BDA OHE qualification?Though I have learnt so much from the dental professionals I have worked with over the years, I had always wanted to obtain a Certificate in Oral Health Education. I felt like I had the knowledge but wanted to know the science behind it. I had to do it - I owed it to myself, plus I wanted the OHE badge!My week is completely variable; it's exciting and never the same each day.Tell us about how the new supervised tooth brushing programme for nursery and reception pupils, that was launched in January 2025, has been received.The programme, in my opinion, has been very well received. The children enjoy brushing their teeth with their peers and doing it as part of the school day. Parents have commented that their children are more interested in brushing at home since the programme started. The staff tell me they are relieved that the programme is running as they are aware of the impact of child dental decay. It affects the whole family with missed workdays for parents and missed school for the child due to feeling unwell or being sent home due to pain and being unable to focus.Can you briefly describe a working week?My week is completely variable; it's exciting and never the same each day. One day I could be attending a meeting in a school to discuss the possibility of implementing supervised tooth brushing. The next I could be visiting parents/guardians and their children (with additional needs), to provide tailored 1 to 1 advice in the comfort of their own home. Or, I could be providing training to staff from nursery schools, creches or childminders looking to achieve one of the Healthy Early Years London (HEYL) awards. Or I may be working on resources, such as creating a PowerPoint presentation, or in a classroom with 30 children singing, ‘This is the way we brush our teeth'.Do you feel the OHE qualification has benefitted your role, how?Yes absolutely! I feel even more confident now as it has deepened my understanding of the science supporting oral health advice and widened my knowledge of oral health conditions.Knowledge is power, so empower yourself, and you never know when that OHE qualification may come in handy.Would you encourage or recommend our BDA OHE programme to a colleague?If I said ‘BDA' it would speak for itself!To a dental nurse I would say, go for it! Knowledge is power, so empower yourself, and you never know when that OHE qualification may come in handy.Don't be afraid and worry about how to fit everything in. The online aspect and flexibility of the programme was perfect and fitted so well around my young family and work commitments. I found I could study at 5 am and still have time to get my son ready for school.Dental nursing jobs come up all the time, however with Oral Health Educator/Promotion roles - you never know when the opportunity arises, so you need to be prepared and gain the BDA qualification.Is there one thing you would change about the OHE programme?It was brilliant, I enjoyed the course immensely, the modules were fun and easily accessible. I appreciated that I could study at any time of day or night. If I could change one thing, I would add an audio book, something that I could play to help me revise while I was doing something else like going for a walk.To find out more about the BDA's courses for dental care professionals (DCPs), visithttps://www.bda.org/learning/courses-for-dcps/.

    "title": "Reaching further with  oral health education",
    "abstract": "Harry Morrisexplores how forward-thinking oral healthcare teams are turning everyday care into meaningful education, and why this shift matters more than ever.©EMS UK One of the most important shifts in modern dentistry is the growing emphasis on education as an integral part of patient care. Oral healthcare teams are no longer focused solely on treatment delivery but increasingly see themselves as advocates for prevention, inclusion and long-term behaviour change. At EMS, we are proud to support practices across the UK and Ireland that are leading this transformation, finding creative, practical ways to build understanding and confidence at every stage of the patient journey. A common challenge in oral health promotion is helping people understand what they cannot see. Biofilm, the primary cause of both caries and periodontal disease, is invisible to the naked eye and often underestimated by patients. While dental professionals are familiar with its impact, many individuals assume that clean-looking teeth equate to good oral health.This is where visual learning becomes invaluable. Practices using disclosing agents, intraoral cameras and real-time demonstrations report greater engagement during hygiene appointments. The visualisation of biofilm often prompts questions, clarifies the importance of daily routines and helps reframe the patient's role in their own care. Education is not confined to the dental chair. Some practices have explored community-facing approaches such as Guided Biofilm Therapy (GBT) open days, informal events where members of the public are invited to receive hygiene advice, observe demonstrations or try disclosing tablets. These initiatives can create a low-pressure environment to introduce key oral health messages and engage individuals who may not routinely visit the dentist.One example took place in Brighton, where EMS partnered with Christina Chatfield's Dental Health Spa to host an open day in the school holidays dedicated to children's oral health. As part of the event, Swiss Dental Academy trainers delivered GBT to young patients in a calm, educational setting. The aim was to help children feel comfortable with hygiene care and introduce the concept of prevention in an accessible way.A different approach was taken at The Health Society in Mayfair, where Dr Victoria Sampson hosted a dedicated preventive open day for members of the consumer press. Held on a Saturday to maximise access, the event offered appointments focused on the GBT protocol and attracted health influencers with a combined audience of over 300,000. The team used the opportunity to highlight the science behind biofilm and the importance of preventive oral care, helping to extend key messages far beyond the surgery and into mainstream health conversations.Outreach can also take other forms, from participating in awareness events to supporting local health campaigns. These activities offer practices a route to connect with their wider communities and reflect a growing commitment within the profession to promote oral health beyond treatment alone. Inclusive education requires thoughtful communication. Many practices are now adapting their materials and clinical interactions to improve their support of patients with anxiety, neurodivergent needs or limited health literacy. This might involve simplified explanations, calm routines, or tailored appointment reminders that reduce stress and increase understanding.Education also continues long after the patient has left the surgery. Increasingly, practices are using digital platforms to reinforce preventive messages. Some share short videos on social media or in waiting rooms explaining how biofilm forms, how to brush effectively, or how oral health connects with general wellbeing. These messages are often most powerful when paired with the visuals and conversations patients experience during their hygiene appointments.When practices put education front and centre, they are contributing  to a wider culture of prevention, empathy and accessibility.Clinicians such as Laura Bailey are helping lead the way in this space. By using Instagram to share engaging, evidence-based oral health content with the public, she has built a growing following and created an accessible channel for prevention messaging. Her posts range from brushing technique tips to the science behind biofilm, helping patients understand the ‘why' behind professional guidance and reinforcing trust in the hygiene visit itself. Integrating education into daily dental workflows is not just beneficial, it is essential. Whether delivered chairside, online or out in the community, these messages help patients make informed decisions, form better habits and feel supported in their care. When practices put education front and centre, they are not only improving individual outcomes but also contributing to a wider culture of prevention, empathy and accessibility.To learn more about how the GBT approach can support prevention-led care and patient engagement, visitwww.ems-dental.comor contact your local GBT Expert.

    "title": "Editor-in-Chief's letter",
    "abstract": "‘Oral health must be considered in conjunction with general health'; ‘it's time to put the mouth back into the body...' - these are statements that are being quoted regularly nowadays by most stakeholders across the oral and dental health profession. The government's ten-year NHS health plan published just recently also highlights a positive shift away from ‘treating disease' to ‘preventing disease'. Myself and others in the profession have long been calling for this paradigm shift away from an essentially ‘national illness service' to a real ‘national health service'. A treatment-based healthcare service is not fundamentally sustainable long term, both economically or socio-ecologically. Attitudes across all oral health stakeholder groups need to change, from policy makers to funders, from clinicians to the public, from industry partners to regulators. Let‘s move away from the treatment question: \"What is the matter with you?\" to \"What matters to you?\" Prevention in all its forms needs to be incentivised by and to all stakeholder groups. Oral health prevention messaging needs to be consistent, engaging, supportive, deliverable and pragmatic for members of the public to appreciate its value. Let's not forget, 90% of prevention has to be effective with personal ‘at-home' care. It's a two-way facilitation process, between patients and the oral healthcare team. This is where the role of the oral healthcare team members in oral health education, facilitation, empowerment and promotion becomes critical. Positive messaging, personalised achievable goal setting and motivation to empower the patient and caregivers, as opposed to simply ‘educating/lecturing' them, is pivotal in the psychology of behaviour change. Our profession has not been all that successful in doing this to date. There is a real public need to value and appreciate the importance of preventing oral disease and its implications to general health. The excellent articles in this issue ofBDJ Teamoutline several aspects of the key roles different members of the oral healthcare team play in this regard and the importance of this aspect of oral healthcare delivery, using the best practice minimum intervention oral care (MIOC) framework to do this.

CLASSIC 03 BABY, 04 KIDS and 09 JUNIOR toothbrushes for children are soft and kind to children's developing gingiva and enamel. The CLASSIC 03 BABY has been specifically designed for babies and toddlers up to the age of 3. 04 KIDS is perfectly suited for children aged 4-7. Both of these toothbrushes are designed with a long handle to make it easy for adults to support children in brushing. The CLASSIC 09 JUNIOR is designed with a broader handle to help older children achieve the ideal grip to brush well independently. The brush head is positioned so children are naturally prompted to rotate the brush rather than use a back-and-forth motion, helping to achieve a better clean. The whole range of children's toothbrushes come in bright, assorted colours, and are the perfect tool for parents and carers to teach children how to keep their mouths clean every day.

    "title": "The Batman and Robin of oral health",
    "abstract": "To encourage consistency with interdental brushing in the daily oral hygiene routine, Curaprox has designed the Super Duo, a heroic pairing of the CS 5460 toothbrush and two CS interdental brushes that ensures villainy can be cleaned away from every tooth surface. By harnessing the gentle yet effective cleaning power of its Curen filaments - which are three times denser than the average toothbrush - and its angled head, patients using the CS 5460 can attain an optimal standard in oral hygiene. This can be followed by harnessing the powers of the CS 07 and 09 interdental brushes to disturb the trapped food particles that a traditional toothbrush cannot, reducing the risk of caries. For a more ergonomic approach to this, the Super Duo pack also contains a brush holder that houses both interdental brushes at once; patients can quickly alternate between them depending on the size they need. Available in numerous colours, achieving 100% clean teeth has never been easier with the Super Duo from Curaprox.

    "title": "Premium, easy to use brushes that don't hurt our environment",
    "abstract": "Severe periodontitis is the sixth most prevalent medical condition in the world1and is linked to significant medical conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's and pregnancy related complications.2One in four dental implants is at risk of peri-implantitis.3The primary reason for such a high incidence of periodontal disease is that the majority of people do not clean their mouth well enough to prevent accumulation of dental plaque.4 The S3 guidelines3,5highlight the importance of daily oral care in the prevention and management of periodontal disease around teeth and implants. Individuals are advised to brush twice and use interdental brushes once daily. Other interdental cleaning aids are not as effective as interdental brushes in the removal of plaque6and are only advised where the smallest interdental brush will not fit. Many of the dental brushes currently on the market are not easy to use, especially by those lacking manual dexterity, and amount in significant plastic waste. With the understanding of the critical importance of daily use of various brushes and the hurdles most individuals face, Dr Dip Malde was inspired to launch The Teeth Keeper. Dip is a practising dentist whose clinical practice is limited to periodontology and implant dentistry. The Teeth Keeper offers The Interdental Brush in nine sizes and The Precision Brush. Their products are designed to make plaque removal easy for everyone. The aluminium handle offers a premium, ergonomic solution for effective daily plaque removal especially in the posterior areas of the mouth. The replacement of only the brush heads coupled with plastic free packaging means a significant reduction in plastic waste. The Teeth Keeper products are supplied exclusively to dental practices in the UK. More information on The Teeth  Keeper products can be found atwww.theteethkeeper.co.uk.

    "abstract": "In the UK, 93% of adults feel that having a nice smile and straight teeth would improve their overall self-confidence.1It's no surprise, then, that practitioners want to offer their patients a range of orthodontic options, including clear aligner treatment (CAT). CAT is popular with patients as it offers a discrete, comfortable and convenient alternative to traditional fixed braces. The size of the CAT market has been calculated at USD 8.51 billion in 2025 and is forecast to reach around USD 94.84 billion by 2034, growing at a rate of 30.72%.2With the desire from patients to have straight white teeth comes the incentive to fulfil those desires with what on the face of it appears to require little more than good scanning technique, some photos and a grateful laboratory somewhere in the world.",

    "abstract": "The Lepidosauria is the most species-rich group of land-dwelling vertebrates. The group includes around 12,000 species of lizards and snakes (Squamata) and one species of Rhynchocephalia, the tuataraSphenodon punctatusfrom New Zealand1. Squamates owe their success to their generally small size, but also to their highly mobile skull that enables them to manipulate large prey. These key features of lizard and snake skulls are not seen inSphenodon, which makes it important to understand the nature of their common ancestor. Lepidosaurs originated in the Triassic 252–201 million years ago, but confusion has arisen because of incomplete fossils, many of which are generalized lepidosauromorphs, neither squamates nor rhynchocephalians2,3,4,5. Here we report a reasonably complete skull and skeleton of a definitive rhynchocephalian from the Middle Triassic (Anisian) Helsby Sandstone Formation of Devon, UK that is around 3–7 million years older than the oldest currently known lepidosaur. The new species shows, as predicted, a non-mobile skull but an open lower temporal bar and no large palatine teeth, and it seems to have been a specialized feeder on insects. This specimen helps us understand the initial diversification of Lepidosauria as part of the Triassic Revolution, when modern-style terrestrial ecosystems emerged.",

    "title": "Human gastroids to model regional patterning in early stomach development",
    "abstract": "The human stomach features distinct, regionalized functionalities along the anterior–posterior axis1,2. Historically, studies on stomach patterning have used animal models to identify the underlying principles3,4,5,6,7. Recently, human pluripotent stem (hPS)-cell-based gastric organoids for modelling domain-specific development of the fundic and antral epithelium are emerging8,9,10. However, recapitulating self-organized fundic–antral patterning in early stomach organogenesis remains challenging, presenting a considerable barrier for advancing knowledge of stomach organogenesis. Here we report human gastroids—a self-organized multilineage gastric organoid derived from hPS cells—to model gastric fundic–antral patterning in vitro. Through multi-germ-layer co-development, we generate gastroids that feature an epithelial chamber with bipolar fundic–antral patterning, annexed with neural populations near the fundic domain while enveloped by mesenchymal cells, therefore showing molecular, cellular, structural and anatomical similarity to stomach development in vivo. Non-endodermal cells, especially neural populations, function as a critical signalling centre to instruct fundic–antral patterning in gastroids through WNT-mediated crosstalk. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling and genetic silencing further reveal NR2F2 as a key mediator of fundic–antral patterning in gastroid development. This study reveals a principle for instructing gastric patterning and provides a higher-fidelity platform for advancing knowledge of stomach organogenesis and gastric organoid development.",

    "title": "The emergence of globular clusters and globular-cluster-like dwarfs",
    "abstract": "Globular clusters (GCs) are among the oldest and densest stellar systems in the Universe, yet how they form remains a mystery1. Here we present a suite of cosmological simulations in which both dark-matter-free GCs and dark-matter-rich dwarf galaxies naturally emerge in the Standard Cosmology. We show that these objects inhabit distinct locations in the size–luminosity plane and that they have similar ages, age spread, metallicity and metallicity spread to globulars and dwarfs in the nearby Universe. About half of our simulated globulars form by means of regular star formation near the centres of their host dwarf, with the rest forming further out, triggered by mergers. The latter are more tidally isolated and more likely to survive to the present day. Finally, our simulations predict the existence of a new class of object that we call ‘globular-cluster-like dwarfs’ (GCDs). These form from a single, self-quenching, star-formation event in low-mass dark-matter halos at high redshift and have observational properties intermediate between globulars and dwarfs. We identify several dwarfs in our Galaxy, such as Reticulum II (refs.2,3,4), that could be in this new class. If so, they promise unprecedented constraints on dark-matter models and new sites to search for metal-free stars.",

    "title": "Programmable antisense oligomers for phage functional genomics",
    "abstract": "Bacteriophages are the most abundant entities on earth and exhibit vast genetic and phenotypic diversity. Exploitation of this largely unexplored molecular space requires identification and functional characterization of genes that act at the phage–host interface. So far, this has been restricted to few model phage–host systems that are amenable to genetic manipulation. Here, to overcome this limitation, we introduce a non-genetic mRNA targeting approach using exogenous delivery of programmable antisense oligomers to silence genes of DNA and RNA phages. A systematic knockdown screen of core and accessory genes of the nucleus-forming jumbo phage ΦKZ, coupled to RNA-sequencing and microscopy analyses, reveals previously unrecognized proteins that are essential for phage propagation and that, upon silencing, elicit distinct phenotypes at the level of the phage and host response. One of these factors is the RNase H-like protein ΦKZ155 (also known as Nlp2), which acts at a major decision point during infection, linking the formation of the protective phage nucleus to phage genome amplification. This non-genetic antisense oligomer-based gene silencing method promises to be a versatile tool for molecular discovery in phage biology, will help to elucidate defence and anti-defence mechanisms in non-model phage–host pairs, and offers potential for optimizing phage therapy and biotechnological procedures.",

    "title": "Stabilizing effect of amino acids on protein and colloidal dispersions",
    "abstract": "Amino acids (AAs) have a long history of being used as stabilizers for biological media1. For example, they are important components in biomedical formulations. The effect of AAs on biological systems is also starting to be appreciated. For example, it is believed that water-stressed cells increase the levels of AAs to prevent protein aggregation2. Several hypotheses have been put forward regarding their function, ranging from water-structuring3to hydrotropic4to specific effects such as stabilization against misfolding, yet it is not known whether their stabilizing function is protein specific or a generic colloidal property. Here we deduce that AAs possess a new and broad colloidal property: they stabilize patchy nanoscale colloids by adsorbing onto their surfaces through weak interactions. We demonstrate this general property by careful experimental evaluation of the stabilizing effect of AAs on dispersions of various proteins, plasmid DNA and non-biological nanoparticles. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical framework that captures this phenomenon and experimentally corroborate several new broad theoretical implications that apply beyond AAs. In vivo experiments further demonstrate that the addition of 1 M proline to insulin doubles its bioavailability in blood. Overall, our results indicate that the role of small molecules is as important as that of ionic strength and should always be reported in biophysics experiments.",

    "abstract": "Cancer development and response to treatment are evolutionary processes1,2, but characterizing evolutionary dynamics at a clinically meaningful scale has remained challenging3. Here we develop a new methodology called EVOFLUx, based on natural DNA methylation barcodes fluctuating over time4, that quantitatively infers evolutionary dynamics using only a bulk tumour methylation profile as input. We apply EVOFLUx to 1,976 well-characterized lymphoid cancer samples spanning a broad spectrum of diseases and show that initial tumour growth rate, malignancy age and epimutation rates vary by orders of magnitude across disease types. We measure that subclonal selection occurs only infrequently within bulk samples and detect occasional examples of multiple independent primary tumours. Clinically, we observe faster initial tumour growth in more aggressive disease subtypes, and that evolutionary histories are strong independent prognostic factors in two series of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Using EVOFLUx for phylogenetic analyses of aggressive Richter-transformed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia samples detected that the seed of the transformed clone existed decades before presentation. Orthogonal verification of EVOFLUx inferences is provided using additional genetic data, including long-read nanopore sequencing, and clinical variables. Collectively, we show how widely available, low-cost bulk DNA methylation data precisely measure cancer evolutionary dynamics, and provides new insights into cancer biology and clinical behaviour.",

However, most naturally occurring antigens, such as tumour-associated antigens, stimulate limited receptor clustering and on-target responses owing to insufficient density3,4,5. Here we repurpose proximity labelling6, a method used to biotinylate and identify spatially proximal proteins, to amplify designed probes as synthetic antigen clusters on the cell surface. We develop an in vivo proximity-labelling technology controlled by either red light or ultrasound to covalently tag fluorescein probes at high density near a target antigen. Using T cell receptors as an example, we demonstrate that the amplified fluorescein effectively clusters and directs a fluorescein-binding bispecific T cell engager to induce enhanced T cell activation and cytotoxicity. Noninvasive, tissue-selective labelling in multiple syngeneic mouse tumour models produces potent immune responses that rapidly eradicate treated tumours. Efficient cell lysis further promotes epitope spreading to induce systemic immunity against untreated distal lesions and immune memory against rechallenge. Thus, proximity-labelling chemistry holds promise as a generalized strategy to manipulate antigen-dependent receptor function and cell states.",

    "abstract": "Loss-of-function variants in the lipid transporter ABCA7 substantially increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease1,2, yet how they impact cellular states to drive disease remains unclear. Here, using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing analysis of human brain samples, we identified widespread gene expression changes across multiple neural cell types associated with rareABCA7loss-of-function variants. Excitatory neurons, which expressed the highest levels ofABCA7, showed disrupted lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, DNA repair and synaptic signalling pathways. Similar transcriptional disruptions occurred in neurons carrying the common Alzheimer’s-associated variant ABCA7 p.Ala1527Gly3, predicted by molecular dynamics simulations to alter the ABCA7 structure. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-cell-derived neurons withABCA7loss-of-function variants recapitulated these transcriptional changes, displaying impaired mitochondrial function, increased oxidative stress and disrupted phosphatidylcholine metabolism. Supplementation with CDP-choline increased phosphatidylcholine synthesis, reversed these abnormalities and normalized amyloid-β secretion and neuronal hyperexcitability—key Alzheimer’s features that are exacerbated by ABCA7 dysfunction. Our results implicate disrupted phosphatidylcholine metabolism inABCA7-related Alzheimer’s risk and highlight a possible therapeutic approach.",

    "title": "Neuronal activity-dependent mechanisms of small cell lung cancer pathogenesis",
    "abstract": "Neural activity is increasingly recognized as a crucial regulator of cancer growth. In the brain, neuronal activity robustly influences glioma growth through paracrine mechanisms1and by electrochemical integration of malignant cells into neural circuitry via neuron-to-glioma synapses2,3. Outside of the central nervous system, innervation of tumours such as prostate, head and neck, breast, pancreatic, and gastrointestinal cancers by peripheral nerves similarly regulates cancer progression4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. However, the extent to which the nervous system regulates small cell lung cancer (SCLC) progression, either in the lung or when growing within the brain, is less well understood. SCLC is a lethal high-grade neuroendocrine tumour that exhibits a strong propensity to metastasize to the brain. Here we demonstrate that in the lung, vagus nerve transection markedly inhibits primary lung tumour development and progression, highlighting a critical role for innervation in SCLC growth. In the brain, SCLC cells co-opt neuronal activity-regulated mechanisms to stimulate growth and progression. Glutamatergic and GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-producing) cortical neuronal activity each drive proliferation of SCLC in the brain through paracrine and synaptic neuron–cancer interactions. SCLC cells form bona fide neuron-to-SCLC synapses and exhibit depolarizing currents with consequent calcium transients in response to neuronal activity; such SCLC cell membrane depolarization is sufficient to promote the growth of intracranial tumours. Together, these findings illustrate that neuronal activity has a crucial role in dictating SCLC pathogenesis.",

Analyses of the objects, in particular pristine samples returned from asteroid Ryugu, have provided detailed information on fluid–rock interactions within a few million years after parent-body formation6,7,8,9,10,11. However, the long-term fate of asteroidal water remains poorly understood. Here we present evidence for fluid flow in a carbonaceous asteroid more than 1 billion years after formation, based on the176Lu–176Hf decay systematics of Ryugu samples, which reflect late lutetium mobilization. Such late fluid flow was probably triggered by an impact that generated heat for ice melting and opened rock fractures for fluid migration. This contrasts the early aqueous activity powered by short-lived radioactive decay, with limited fluid flow and little elemental fractionation12. Our results imply that carbonaceous planetesimals accreted by the terrestrial planets could have retained not only hydrous minerals but also aqueous water, leading to an upwards revision of the inventory of their water delivery by a factor of two to three.",

    "abstract": "Cancer-associated muscle wasting is associated with poor clinical outcomes1, but its underlying biology is largely uncharted in humans2. Unbiased analysis of the RNAome (coding and non-coding RNAs) with unsupervised clustering using integrative non-negative matrix factorization3provides a means of identifying distinct molecular subtypes and was applied here to muscle of patients with colorectal or pancreatic cancer. Rectus abdominis biopsies from 84 patients were profiled using high-throughput next-generation sequencing. Integrative non-negative matrix factorization with stringent quality metrics for clustering identified two highly coherent molecular subtypes within muscle of patients with cancer. Patients with subtype 1 (versus subtype 2) showed clinical manifestations of cachexia: high-grade weight loss, low muscle mass, atrophy of type IIA and type IIX muscle fibres, and reduced survival. On the basis of differential expression between the subtypes, we identified biological processes that may contribute to cancer-associated loss of muscle mass and function, including altered posttranscriptional regulation and perturbation of neuronal systems; cytokine storm and cellular immune response; pathways related to extracellular matrix; and metabolic abnormalities spanning xenobiotic metabolism, haemostasis, signal transduction, embryonic and/or pluripotent stem cells, and amino acid metabolism. Differential expression between subtypes indicated the involvement of multiple intertwined higher-order gene regulatory networks, suggesting that network interactions of (hub) long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs and mRNAs could represent targets for future research.",

    "abstract": "Controlling spin currents, that is, the flow of spin angular momentum, in small magnetic devices, is the principal objective of spin electronics, a main contender for future energy-efficient information technologies1,2. A pure spin current has never been measured directly because the associated electric stray fields and/or shifts in the non-equilibrium spin-dependent distribution functions are too small for conventional experimental detection methods optimized for charge transport3,4. Here we report that resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) can bridge this gap by measuring the spin current carried by magnons—the quanta of the spin wave excitations of the magnetic order—in the presence of temperature gradients across a magnetic insulator. This is possible due to the sensitivity of the momentum- and energy-resolved RIXS intensity to minute changes in the magnon distribution under non-equilibrium conditions. We use the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation to extract transport parameters, such as the magnon lifetime at finite momentum, essential for the realization of magnon spintronics.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial cells work collectively to provide a protective barrier, yet they turn over rapidly through cell division and death. If the numbers of dividing and dying cells do not match, the barrier can vanish, or tumours can form. Mechanical forces through the stretch-activated ion channel Piezo1 link both of the processes; stretch promotes cell division, whereas crowding triggers live cells to extrude and then die1,2. However, it was not clear what selects a given crowded cell for extrusion. Here we show that the crowded cells with the least energy and membrane potential are selected for extrusion. Crowding triggers sodium (Na+) entry through the epithelial Na+channel (ENaC), which depolarizes cells. While those with sufficient energy repolarize, those with limited ATP remain depolarized, which, in turn, triggers water egress through the voltage-gated potassium (K+) channels Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 and the chloride (Cl−) channel SWELL1. Transient water loss causes cell shrinkage, amplifying crowding to activate crowding-induced live cell extrusion. Thus, our findings suggest that ENaC acts as a tension sensor that probes for cells with the least energy to extrude and die, possibly damping inadvertent crowding activation of Piezo1 in background cells. We reveal crowding-sensing mechanisms upstream of Piezo1 that highlight water regulation and ion channels as key regulators of epithelial cell turnover.",

    "abstract": "Extreme event attribution assesses how climate change affected climate extremes, but typically focuses on single events1,2,3,4. Furthermore, these attributions rarely quantify the extent to which anthropogenic actors have contributed to these events5,6. Here we show that climate change made 213 historical heatwaves reported over 2000–2023 more likely and more intense, to which each of the 180 carbon majors (fossil fuel and cement producers) substantially contributed. This work relies on the expansion of a well-established event-based framework1. Owing to global warming since 1850–1900, the median of the heatwaves during 2000–2009 became about 20 times more likely, and about 200 times more likely during 2010–2019. Overall, one-quarter of these events were virtually impossible without climate change. The emissions of the carbon majors contribute to half the increase in heatwave intensity since 1850–1900. Depending on the carbon major, their individual contribution is high enough to enable the occurrence of 16–53 heatwaves that would have been virtually impossible in a preindustrial climate. We, therefore, establish that the influence of climate change on heatwaves has increased, and that all carbon majors, even the smaller ones, contributed substantially to the occurrence of heatwaves. Our results contribute to filling the evidentiary gap to establish accountability of historical climate extremes7,8.",

This organic carbon appears to have participated in post-depositional redox reactions that produced the observed iron-phosphate and iron-sulfide minerals. Geological context and petrography indicate that these reactions occurred at low temperatures. Within this context, we review the various pathways by which redox reactions that involve organic matter can produce the observed suite of iron-, sulfur- and phosphorus-bearing minerals in laboratory and natural environments on Earth.

Cancer-to-neuron synapses have been reported in gliomas6,7, but whether peripheral tumours can form such structures is unknown.

Using in vivo insertional mutagenesis screening in conjunction with cross-species genomic and transcriptomic validation, we identified neuronal, synaptic and glutamatergic signalling gene sets in mouse and human SCLC. Further experiments revealed the ability of SCLC cells to form synaptic structures with neurons in vitro and in vivo. Electrophysiology and optogenetic experiments confirmed that cancer cells can receive NMDA receptor- and GABAAreceptor-mediated synaptic inputs. Fitting with a potential oncogenic role of neuron–SCLC interactions, we showed that SCLC cells derive a proliferation advantage when co-cultured with vagal sensory or cortical neurons. Moreover, inhibition of glutamate signalling had therapeutic efficacy in an autochthonous mouse model of SCLC. Therefore, following malignant transformation, SCLC cells seem to hijack synaptic signalling to promote tumour growth, thereby exposing a new route for therapeutic intervention.",

Its clinical application, however, is hindered by serious adverse reactions and reduced efficacy following long-term treatment. In this study, we investigated the factors influencing the sensitivity of DS-8201 and developed effective combination regimens to optimize its therapeutic efficacy. We showed that HER3 upregulation diminished the sensitivity of HER2-positive tumor cells to DS-8201. We found that DS-8201 treatment activated DNA damage repair responses in BT-474 cells, in which the ATR kinase pathway induced the expression of the HER3 transcription factor FoxO1, leading to increased HER3 levels. This process was triggered by the payload component of DS-8201, the topoisomerase I inhibitor DXd, rather than the antibody. Based on this finding, we showed that combining DS-8201 with either a HER3-targeting antibody (SIBP-03) or an ATR inhibitor (BAY1895344) resulted in significant synergistic antitumor efficacy without substantial toxicity in vitro or in vivo. Overall, this study revealed that the ATR/FoxO1/HER3 pathway plays a critical role in modulating the efficacy of DS-8201, suggesting that combining DS-8201 with ATR or HER3 inhibition represents a promising therapeutic strategy for HER2-positive cancers.",

Abnormal expression of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is closely linked to NSCLC progression, highlighting the need for effective FAK inhibitors in NSCLC treatment. In this study we conducted high-throughput virtual screening combined with cellular assays to identify potential FAK inhibitors for NSCLC treatment. Fosaprepitant (FOS), a clinical antiemetic drug, exhibited a high affinity for FAK with aKDvalue of 4.35 × 10⁻⁵ M. The direct interaction between FOS and FAK was confirmed by molecular docking, molecular dynamics, drug affinity responsive target stability and surface plasmon resonance analysis. We showed that FOS (15, 25 μM) dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of A549 and H1299 cells by targeting FAK. The IC50values in inhibiting the cell viability at 24 h were 73.05 and 126.1 μM, respectively. Knockdown FAK reversed the inhibitory effects of FOS on A549 cells. Using RNA sequencing and Western blotting analysis, we demonstrated that FOS treatment led to downregulation of the AKT and JNK/c-Jun signaling pathways in A549 and H1299 cells. Importantly, point mutation analyses revealed that FOS primarily targeted the Y925 phosphorylation site on FAK. In A549 cells xenograft nude mouse model, administration of FOS (20, 60 mg/kg, i.p. every 2 d for 2 weeks) dose-dependently suppressed the tumor growth. Collectively, FOS exhibits significant anti-NSCLC activity both in vitro and in vivo by binding to FAK and inhibiting its phosphorylation, thereby blocking the AKT and JNK/c-Jun signaling pathways.

    "abstract": "Recent investigations into the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine, along with studies on schizophrenia-related susceptibility genes, have highlighted the GluN2A subunit as a critical regulator of both emotion and cognition. However, the specific impacts of acute pharmacological inhibition of GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors on brain microcircuits and the subsequent behavioral consequences remain poorly understood. In this study, we first examined the effects of MPX-004, a selective GluN2A NMDA receptor inhibitor, on behavior within the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). Local administration of MPX-004 in the dmPFC led to a reduced immobility duration in the forced swim test, an acute antidepressant-like effect, impairments in sensorimotor gating, and a schizophrenia-like phenotype. In vivo multiple-channel recordings and c-Fos staining revealed that MPX-004 decreases the activity of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PV-INs) and increases the activity of pyramidal neurons (PYNs). In vivo patch-clamp recordings further confirmed that PV-IN inactivation leads to an elevated PYN firing rate in the PFC. In vitro whole-cell recordings demonstrated that PV-INs receive stronger excitatory synaptic input and respond more robustly to presynaptic stimulation than do somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs) and PYNs, rendering them susceptible to GluN2A inhibition. Finally, the specific knockdown of GluN2A in prefrontal PV-INs abolished the behavioral effects of MPX-004, underscoring a critical role of the GluN2A-mediated modulation of PV-INs in these phenotypes. Together, these findings reveal that PV-INs are particularly vulnerable to GluN2A inhibition, leading to disinhibition of prefrontal circuits and resulting in both antidepressant-like and schizophrenia-like behaviors.",

    "title": "Proteasome 20S beta 8 (PSMB8) as a metabolic switcher of neuronal ferroptosis in multiple sclerosis",
    "abstract": "While multiple sclerosis (MS) has long been characterized by inflammatory demyelination and progressive neurodegeneration, cortical thinning and neuronal loss are definitive hallmarks of advanced pathology [1]. Focal cortical thinning can arise beside an overall reduction of the cortical thickness with disease progression [2]. Structural neuroimaging demonstrates that brain atrophy patterns and lesion burden are significantly associated with cognitive impairment and sensorimotor in MS [3,4]. Neuroinflammation can lead to mitochondrial damage in neurons, causing an energy deficit and further reducing axonal health [5]. The brain infiltrating immune cells, such as T cells, B cells, myeloid cells and activated glia, release inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic factors, simultaneously create a metabolically hostile microenvironment characterized by acidosis, hypoxia, and ion imbalance [6]. Within this pathological milieu, neurons are exposed to excitotoxicity and misfolded protein accumulation, challenging their survival [6]. Although these metabolic disturbances clearly contribute to neuronal dysfunction and death, the exact cellular responses of neurons to such inflammatory stress, as well as the precise molecular mechanisms linking metabolic failure to neuronal demise (whether through apoptosis, necroptosis, or other cell death pathways), are still poorly understood. Mitochondrial proteome integrity is essential for cellular function, and mitochondrial proteostasis defects lead to proteotoxic stress and cell death [7]. Thus, exploring proteasomal regulation may uncover new therapeutic strategies in MS patients. A recent study by Woo et al. inCellidentified a crucial neuron-intrinsic pathway connecting chronic inflammation to metabolic dysfunction and neuronal loss in MS [8]. The authors observed that the interferon-induced immunoproteasome significantly reduces proteasomal activity in neurons, resulting in a shift in neuronal metabolism characterized by heightened oxidative damage and ferroptosis [8]. It highlights the immunoproteasome subunit proteasome 20S beta 8 (PSMB8) as a pivotal mediator and potential therapeutic target [8]. In neuroinflammatory conditions like MS and its murine model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), neurons increase the expression of PSMB8 in response to IFN-γ. However, unlike immune cells where immunoproteasome formation enhances proteolytic activity, the incorporation of PSMB8 into neuronal proteasomes reduces its overall activity. This leads to a disruption in protein homeostasis, as shown by the buildup of polyubiquitinated proteins. The study shows that the dysfunction specific to neurons is different from the immunoproteasome’s usual role in antigen presentation and cytoprotection in dividing cells. It explains why neurodegeneration continues even with immunomodulation, as chronic inflammation directly interferes with neuronal protein balance and metabolism through PSMB8. Importantly, neurodegeneration in other conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease also features inflammation and proteasomal impairment [9], suggesting broader relevance (Fig.1).Fig. 1: Proteasome 20S beta 8 (PSMB8)-dependent immunoproteasome paradox in immune cells and neurons.Under inflammatory conditions, both immune cells and neurons upregulate PSMB8, leading to increased assembly of immunoproteasomes. However, the functional consequences differ due to distinct substrate preferences: In Immune Cells: Inflammation induces defective ribosomal products (DRiPs), which are efficiently degraded by immunoproteasomes. Processed DRiPs are presented via MHC-I to activate CD8+T cells, amplifying immune responses. In Neurons: Neurons constitutively degrade PFKFB3 (a glycolytic regulator) via standard proteasomes to suppress glycolysis and promote the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), sustaining antioxidative defenses via NADPH. Immunoproteasomes exhibit reduced PFKFB3 degradation, causing its accumulation. This shifts metabolism toward glycolysis, suppresses PPP, and depletes NADPH, ultimately triggering ferroptosis.Full size image This research connects previously separate pathological features, linking neuroinflammation, energy deficiency, and neurodegeneration in MS patients [8,10]. Chronic exposure to IFN-γ, with CD8+T cells as a major cellular source in the CNS, leads to a neuron-specific switch in the immunoproteasome causing ferroptosis through metabolic disturbances. As one form of regulated cell death, ferroptosis is iron- and ROS-dependent [11]. Misregulated ferroptosis has been linked to various physiological and pathological processes, including cancer cell death, tissue injury, and T-cell immunity [12]. Among the various mechanisms affecting ferroptosis, ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is intricately linked to the molecular processes regulating ferroptosis, and its dysregulation is associated with the development of tumors and neurodegenerative disorders [13]. Proteasomal dysfunction causes the build-up of PFKFB3, an enzyme involved in metabolism that is normally broken down. This accumulation disrupts neuronal metabolism by increasing glycolysis, depleting NADPH, reducing activity in the pentose phosphate pathway, compromising antioxidant defense, and leading to elevated oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species production, and lipid peroxidation. This metabolic alteration makes neurons more vulnerable to ferroptosis, an iron-dependent, oxidative form of cell death. The prominence of CD8+T cells in late-stage MS is particularly salient. This study offers some explanation on CD8+T cells, one of the main sources of IFN-γ, presence in late stage of MS brain, even outnumbered CD4+, contributing to MS progression [14]. The IFN-γ+CD8+T cells increasingly infiltrate the CNS during progressive MS phases, ultimately outnumbering CD4+T cells in chronic lesions. This aligns with clinical observations that CD8+T cells dominate inflammatory activity in advanced MS brains and drive disease progression through sustained IFN-γ production [15]. The study explains that these cells cause damage by inducing neuronal PSMB8, which impairs the ubiquitin-proteasome system and leads to toxic PFKFB3 accumulation [8]. This results in a pathological metabolic shift in neurons, with elevated glycolysis suppressing the pentose phosphate pathway and depleting glutathione, making cells more susceptible to oxidative injury. The interventions of cell death, specifically inhibiting PFKFB3, a key metabolic regulator with compounds like Pfk-158, confer robust neuroprotection in EAE by normalizing glycolysis/pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) balance [8]. PFKFB3 could be considered as a promising translational target, as Pfk-158 is already in cancer trials [16]. Moreover, among inhibitors targeting regulated cell death (RCD), SAR443820, a brain-penetrant RIPK1 inhibitor, entered Phase II clinical trials for ALS (NCT05237284) but was discontinued due to unmet efficacy endpoints. However, the Phase II trial of SAR443820 in MS is ongoing [17]. These outcomes underscore the need for novel RCD targets to treat neurodegeneration in MS [8]. In this context, the neuron-specific PSMB8-PFKFB3 axis identified in this study offers a promising therapeutic target. By modulating ferroptosis sensitivity in neurons, this pathway presents a new target for neuroprotective intervention in progressive MS. Moreover, the paradoxical exacerbation of MS by anti-IFN-γ therapies may also be explained by the unique induction of PSMB8 in neurons in response to IFN-γ [18]. Systemic IFN-γ blockade could disrupt immune homeostasis without addressing neuron-specific vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for cell type-specific strategies like neuron-targeted PFKFB3 inhibition. Another crucial, yet unexplored question is whether this mechanism operates in oligodendrocytes? Although this study reveals PFKFB3 accumulation in CC1+(pre-)myelinating oligodendrocytes during late EAE, it remains unclear if immunoproteasome dysregulation similarly drives their demise. Given that oligodendrocyte loss and myelin damage are central to MS, future studies should determine if the PSMB8 plays a role in the vulnerability of oligodendrocytes and myelin damage in MS, especially considering the upregulation of PSMB8 in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (NG2+) during inflammation. Together, the discoveries by Woo et al. extend beyond our knowledge how PSMB8-PFKFB3-ferroptosis axis linked to metabolic failure and neuronal death in MS. Knowledge in this area will also inform on novel therapeutic approaches targeting this neuron-intrinsic metabolic pathway to MS and potentially other neurodegenerative diseases.

    "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) is a crucial transcriptional factor that regulates fatty acid β-oxidation and ketogenesis in response to fasting. However, the mechanisms underlying PPARα function remain unclear. This study identified a novel PPARα-binding protein—RING finger protein 128 (RNF128)—that facilitates PPARα polyubiquitination, resulting in the degradation and suppression of PPARα function during fasting. Furthermore, RNF128 overexpression inhibited fibroblast growth factor 21 expression and lipid metabolism-related genes by facilitating PPARα degradation during fasting. In contrast, silencing RNF128 expression enhanced PPARα-dependent fatty acid β-oxidation and ketogenesis in starved cells. In vivo experiments demonstrated that RNF128 deficiency also significantly reduced lipid levels while increasing fatty acid β-oxidation and ketogenesis during fasting. Adeno-associated virus serotype 8-mediated RNF128 overexpression resulted in increased lipid levels and decreased expression of genes related to fatty acid β-oxidation and ketogenesis in fasted mice. Our findings revealed that RNF128 is crucial for metabolic adaptation to fasting in the liver by interacting with PPARα, thereby enhancing its polyubiquitination and degradation. Therefore, RNF128 is a novel regulator of PPARα function under nutrient-deprived conditions.",

    "title": "Restoration of the peace in autoimmune disease: tired of fighting?",
    "abstract": "Few topics in T-cell immunology have received as much attention in recent years as the phenomenon known as “exhaustion”. This condition is widely believed to result from excessive repetitive stimulation of T cells, which “exhausts” their ability to perform “effector functions”, such as the production of proinflammatory cytokines, and makes them ineffective in the battle against certain viruses or cancers [1]. Some consider the term “exhaustion” too anthropomorphic and prefer to call this phenomenon “dysfunction” [2]. A study by Bae et al. on this issue of Cellular and Molecular Immunology presented evidence that at least some CD4+T cells with the characteristics of “exhaustion” are not actuallydysfunctional but instead serve adifferentfunction, namely, to promote the restoration of immunological tolerance after a temporary breach thereof [3].The immune system has the delicate task of protecting against pathogens and cancer without causing excessive damage. Healthy tissue must not be attacked, necessitating the existence of mechanisms to ensure self-tolerance. To this end, self-reactive T cells are eliminated during thymic development, whereas regulatory T cells (Tregs) inhibit untoward immune responses via self-reactive T cells that inadvertently escape thymic selection [4]. These mechanisms generally work well, but the existence of autoimmune diseases shows that they are not always perfect. Furthermore, protracted immune responses can cause cumulative tissue damage and, at some point, it may be more beneficial to the fitness of the host to accept the presence of an invader than to endure the consequences of endless battle. T-cell “exhaustion/dysfunction” is thought to help with this, as the loss of T-cell effector functions limits their capacity to inflict damage. Why then even keep such exhausted T cells around? One thought is that they still help contain persistent viruses to subclinical levels without reaching a sterile cure [1,2]. Another possible reason is proposed by Bae et al. [3].",

    "abstract": "Communication between group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) and other immune cells, as well as intestinal epithelial cells, is pivotal in regulating intestinal inflammation. This study, for the first time, underscores the importance of crosstalk between intestinal endothelial cells (ECs) and ILC3. Our single-cell transcriptome analysis combined with protein expression detection revealed that ECs significantly increased the population of interleukin (IL)-22+ILC3 through interactions mediated by endothelin-1 (ET-1) and its receptor endothelin A receptor (EDNRA). Genetic deficiency of EDNRA reduces the proportion of NKp46+ILC3 and impairs IL-22 production in a T-cell-independent, cell-intrinsic manner, leading to increased intestinal inflammation. Mechanistically, the ET-1–EDNRA axis modulates hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) through protein kinase B (AKT) signaling, supporting metabolic adaptation toward glycolysis and providing protection against colitis. Moreover, restoring HIF-1α expression or providing exogenous lactate can alleviate colitis associated with EDNRA deficiency and ILC3 glycolytic dysfunction. These findings underscore the importance of communication between intestinal ECs and ILC3 via the ET-1–EDNRA axis in metabolic adaptation processes within ILC3 and maintaining intestinal homeostasis.",

    "title": "The STING/type I interferon axis drives the interplay between marginal zone B cells and T follicular helper cells in Sjögren’s disease",
    "abstract": "Type I interferon (IFN-I) is highly prevalent in autoimmune disorders and is intricately involved in disease pathogenesis, including Sjögren’s disease (SjD), also known as Sjögren’s syndrome. Although the T follicular helper (Tfh) cell response has been shown to drive SjD development in a mouse model of experimental Sjögren’s syndrome (ESS), the connection between IFN-I and the Tfh cell response remains unclear. As the activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) induces IFN-I production, we first demonstrated that mice deficient in STING or IFN-I signaling presented diminished Tfh cells and were completely resistant to ESS development. However, the STING–IFN-I axis does not directly influence Tfh cell differentiation. Instead, IFN-I signaling in B cells was essential for mounting Tfh cell responses, as evidenced in Cd19CreIfnar1flox mice, which also showed resistance to ESS development. Mechanistic analyses revealed that IFN-I drove CXCR5 expression in innate-like marginal zone B cells via the MEKK3–OCT2 axis, facilitating their migration into the follicular area. Additionally, IFN-I promoted interleukin-6 production in B cells via the MEKK3–ERK5 axis, resulting in hyperactive Tfh cell responses. In SjD patients, STING activation was predominantly observed in circulating CD14+ monocytes and was positively correlated with disease activity and effector T-cell responses. Pharmaceutical inhibition of either STING or IFNAR1 yielded moderate improvements in ESS mice with chronic inflammation, but combination therapy markedly improved outcomes and led to signs of disease remission. Our findings elucidate a novel mechanism by which IFN-I bridges innate and Tfh cell responses, suggesting new therapeutic avenues for SjD and related autoimmune disorders.",

    "title": "Digging into the evolutionary history of the fungus-growing-ant symbiont,Escovopsis(Hypocreaceae)",
    "abstract": "Symbiotic relationships shape the evolution of organisms. Fungi in the genusEscovopsisshare an evolutionary history with the fungus-growing “attine” ant system and are only found in association with these social insects. Despite this close relationship, there are key aspects ofEscovopsisevolution that remain poorly understood. To gain further insight into the evolutionary history of these unique fungi, we delve deeper intoEscovopsis’origin and distribution, considering the largest sampling, so far, across the Americas. Furthermore, we investigateEscovopsis’trait evolution, and relationship with attine ants. We demonstrate that, while the genus originated approximately 56.9 Mya, it only became associated with 'higher attine' ants in the last 38 My. Our results, however, indicate that it is likely that the ancestor ofEscovopsislived in symbiosis with early-diverging fungus-growing ants. Since then, the fungi have evolved morphological and physiological adaptations that have increased their reproductive efficiency, possibly to overcome barriers mounted by the ants and their other associated microbes. Taken together, these results provide new clues as to howEscovopsishas evolved within the context of this complex symbiosis and shed light on the evolutionary history of the fungus-growing ant system.",

    "title": "Triplet-harvesting materials",
    "abstract": "Communications Chemistryis pleased to present a Collection of articles on triplet-harvesting materials. Here, the Guest Editors introduce the topic and look towards the future of the field. Triplet-harvesting materials are a class of functional materials designed to utilize triplet excited states (T₁) for efficient light emission or energy conversion1,2,3. These materials play a crucial role in advanced optoelectronic applications by overcoming the spin-forbidden nature of triplet transitions through strategic molecular design. Generally, the luminescent mechanisms of triplet-harvesting materials can be divided into three types: phosphorescence4,5,6, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF)7,8and triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA)9,10(Fig.1).Fig. 1: Luminescence mechanisms of triplet-harvesting materials.aPhosphorescence;bthermally activated delayed fluorescence;ctriplet-triplet annihilation.Full size image Phosphorescence is a radiative transition from the triplet state (T1) to the ground state (S0) (Fig.1a). Unlike fluorescence, with nanosecond-scale emission lifetimes, phosphorescence can last from microseconds to several seconds due to the involvement of triplet (or triplet excited) states11. This longer-lived emission arises because the transition between T1and S0is spin-forbidden, making it a slower process. Due to the weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the fast non-radiative decay of the triplet excited state, phosphorescence could historically only be observed and detected at low temperature (77 K)12. In recent years, researchers have developed room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) through the introduction of heavy atoms (such as Br, Cl, and Se), heteroatoms (such as N, O, and S), and aromatic carbonyl groups into organic compounds in order to promote SOC and thus enhance the intersystem crossing (ISC) rate. Another effective strategy to achieve RTP is to build a relatively rigid molecular environment, through crystal engineering, host–guest doping, supramolecular self-assembly, and so on, in order to hinder the non-radiative transition of the triplet state. Based on these principles, RTP materials with high quantum yields, long emission lifetimes, and multiple emission colors have been obtained, showing promising applications in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), bioimaging, photodynamic therapy (PDT), sensors, and so on. Phosphorescent materials have revolutionized OLED technology by significantly improving device efficiency (internal quantum efficiency can reach 100% in theory) and extending operational lifetimes. They are extensively used in displays and lighting. Phosphorescent dyes with longer emission lifetimes (from microseconds to seconds) offer advantages over fluorescent counterparts, providing a better contrast and reduced background signal interference, making them suitable for cellular and tissue imaging with high sensitivity. Due to their intrinsic triplet-state emission and sensitivity to the environment, phosphorescent materials can be used as photosensitizers in PDT, as well as in oxygen or temperature sensing. Thermally activated delayed fluorescence is a type of delayed fluorescence from a singlet excited state to the ground state through an effective reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) from the triplet excited state (T1) to the singlet excited state (S1), as shown in Fig.1b. It is a phenomenon that allows organic materials to achieve nearly 100% internal quantum efficiency in light-emitting devices without the need for heavy metal elements. This mechanism leverages the unique properties of certain molecular structures to enable efficient up-conversion of triplet excitons to singlet excitons, thereby facilitating delayed fluorescence emission13,14. Its lifetime is normally on the microsecond scale. For TADF materials, this energy gap (ΔEST) between S1and T1is minimized to facilitate RISC, where triplet excitons are converted back to singlet excitons. Efficient RISC requires small ΔESTvalues, typically less than 0.3 eV, allowing thermal energy to promote the transition. TADF materials are often designed with a donor-acceptor (D-A) architecture, where one part of the molecule acts as an electron donor and the other as an electron acceptor. This arrangement helps the systems localize the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), effectively reducing ΔEST. Thus, TADF materials show great promise in OLEDs due to their high efficiency, broad color tunability, and cost-effectiveness. The third mechanism for triplet-harvesting materials is triplet-triplet annihilation. It is a significant process in the fields of photophysics and photochemistry, where two triplet excited states interact to produce a higher-energy singlet excited state (see Fig.1c)15. This phenomenon is particularly useful in applications like up-conversion luminescence and enhancing the efficiency of energy harvesting systems such as solar cells. This Collection illustrates the breadth and creativity of the triplet-harvesting approaches in the field. For example, the work on carbonyl-nitrogen multi-resonance emitters demonstrates how precise electronic structure design enables high color purity and efficient triplet management in hyperfluorescent OLEDs (https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-025-01435-z)16. Meanwhile, newly developed host materials with high triplet energy, those containing 1,3,5-oxadiazine cores, could effectively confine triplet excitons within phosphorescent and TADF-type emitters, suppressing exciton quenching processes (https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-024-01377-y)17. The studies presented in this Collection collectively highlight the transformative role of triplet-harvesting strategies in advancing luminescent materials. From fundamental design principles to device-level implementations, they underscore how control over triplet excitons is shaping the future of exciton-management technologies. As the field moves forward, continued interdisciplinary efforts will be essential to translate photophysical insights into durable, high-performance materials capable of meeting both technological demands and emerging applications. Looking forward, it is anticipated that the continued integration of synthetic ingenuity, photophysical understanding, and device engineering will yield a new generation of triplet-harvesting materials. These will not only bridge the gap between the efficiency and stability in OLEDs but also unlock novel functionalities in areas such as PDT, sensing, and bioimaging. The strategic control of triplet states through orbital engineering, supramolecular interactions, or external stimuli stands as a compelling frontier in the evolution of photoluminescent and electroluminescent materials.

    "abstract": "Purely organic materials showing efficient and persistent emission via room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) allow the design of minimalistic yet powerful technological solutions for sensing, bioimaging, information storage, and safety applications using the photonic design principle of digital luminescence. Although several promising materials exist, a deep understanding of the underlying structure-property relationship and, thus, development of rational design strategies are widely missing. Some of the best purely organic emitters follow the donor-acceptor-donor design motif. In this study, the influence of the acceptor unit on the photophysical properties is systematically analyzed by synthesizing and characterizing variations of the RTP emitter 4,4′-dithianthrene-1-yl-benzophenone (BP-2TA). The most promising candidates are also tested in programmable luminescent tags as a potential application field for information storage. While no significant influence by the electrophilicity index of the acceptor moiety on the RTP emission is observed, the results support the design of molecules with pronounced hybridization as obtained for the newly synthesized emitter demonstrating superior RTP efficiency combined with improved stability.",

    "abstract": "Promiscuity, or selectivity on a spectrum, is an encoded feature in biomolecular anion recognition. To unravel the molecular drivers of promiscuous anion recognition, we have employed a comprehensive approach – spanning experiment and theory – with theStaphylococcus carnosusnitrate regulatory element A (ScNreA) as a model. Thermodynamic analysis reveals that ScNreA complexation with native nitrate and nitrite or non-native iodide is an exothermic process. Further deconvolution of the association and dissociation kinetics for each anion reveals that the release event can be limiting, in turn, giving rise to the observed selectivity: nitrate > iodide > nitrite. These conclusions are supplemented with molecular dynamics simulations that capture an entry and exit pathway coupled to subtle global protein motions unique to each anion.

    "title": "Metagenomic complexity of high, seasonal transmission ofPlasmodiumspp. in asymptomatic carriers in Northern Sahelian Ghana",
    "abstract": "BackgroundMixed-species, mixed-strain plasmodia infections are known to occur in humans in malaria endemic areas. It may be surprising that to date, the extent of this complexity has not been systematically explored in high-burden countries of sub-Saharan Africa, especially in the reservoir of asymptomatic infections in all ages, which sustains transmission.MethodsHere we take a metagenomic lens to these infections by sampling variable blood volumes from 188 afebrile residents living in high, seasonal transmission in Northern Sahelian Ghana. We estimated multiplicity of infection for differentPlasmodiumspp. through genotyping of antigens and microsatellites. We further defined ‘metagenomic complexity’ as a measure of overall within-host complexity across the combination of species and strains.ResultsWe show that prevalence ofPlasmodiumspp. and inter-/intra-species complexity is significantly higher in larger blood volumes from these individuals. Overall, malaria infections display high levels of metagenomic complexity comprising single-, double-, and triple-species infections with varying levels of intra-species complexity forP. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovale curtisi, and P. ovale wallikeri. We also report a subset of individuals with highly-complex infections that cannot be explained by age or location. The implications of these findings to malaria epidemiology and control are illustrated by a geographic scaling exercise to district and region levels in northern Ghana.ConclusionsOur metagenomic investigation underscores the need to more sensitively measure within-hostPlasmodiumspp. complexity in asymptomatic carriers of infection. This will optimise strategies for malaria surveillance and control.",

PVA was defined as a hyperreflective echo at the peripheral vitreoretinal region under ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM). Eyes were categorised into two groups based on the presence (PVA group) or absence (NPVA group) of PVA. AL, lens thickness (LT), radius of corneal curvature (K1: flat, K2: steep), and corneal cylinder degree (CYL) were measured by IOL-Master. Anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens vault (LV), corneal limbus thickness (CLT), trabecular-ciliary processes distance (TCPD) and angle (TCPA), and peripheral iris thickness (PIT) were measured by UBM. MG incidence was recorded during a minimum 2-year follow-up.ResultsPVA was detected in 29 eyes(62%) from 16 patients (64%). PVA eyes had shorter AL, TCPD, TCPA and larger PIT, LT, LV, CLT, K1, K2 compared to NPVA eyes (allP< 0.05). Thirteen eyes (45%) in the PVA group developed MG postoperatively vs none in the NPVA group (P< 0.05). Logistic regression analysis, adjusted for AL, identified older age, greater angle occlusion, larger K2, higher CYL, thicker LT and CLT as significant risk factors for MG (allP< 0.05).ConclusionsWe first reported PVA under UBM in NSACG eyes, which may partially explain their anatomical predisposition to advanced ACG and MG, and aid in the management of these eyes.",

    "abstract": "This study examined trends in the proportion of adults with self-reported hypertension and in antihypertensive medication use among community-dwelling Australian adults. We analysed data from a longitudinal panel study, covering four waves: 2009 (n= 8023), 2013 (n= 11,475), 2017 (n= 12,843), and 2021 (n= 14,571) for adults aged 18–74 years. Hypertension and antihypertensive medication use were self-reported. Healthcare subsidy was defined as the possession of a low-income healthcare card, a Pensioner Concession Card, or a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. Prevalence estimates were age-standardised to the 2016 Australian Census population. The age-standardised prevalence of hypertension remained stable from 2009 to 2021, i.e., 15.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.1–16.4) in 2009 versus 15.2% (95% CI: 14.6–15.7) in 2021. Antihypertensive medication use increased from 39.4% (95% CI: 37.0–41.7) in 2009 to 46.7% (95% CI: 44.0–49.3) in 2021 (Pfor trend: 0.017). The adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) for hypertension were 1.17 (95% CI: 1.11–1.21) in the 1st (most disadvantaged) Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) quintiles, compared with the 5th (most advantaged) quintile. The PR for antihypertensive medication use were 1.63 (95% CI: 1.11–1.47) in the 1st quintile compared with the 5th quintile. About 58% to 78% of the increased prevalence of hypertension and antihypertensive medication use related to socioeconomic disadvantage was mediated by healthcare subsidy. The prevalence of hypertension in Australia remained stable between 2009 and 2021. While hypertension drug treatment rates improved over the same period, it remains very low, with less than half of those who reported hypertension receiving antihypertensive medication. Healthcare subsidies improve hypertension detection and treatment, especially in socioeconomically disadvantaged groups.",

    "abstract": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) [1] and Peyronie’s disease (PD) [2] significantly impact quality of life and intimate relationships. ED is the persistent inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual performance [1]. PD is a localized fibrotic condition of the penile tunica albuginea, typically arising from abnormal wound-healing, and is associated with curvature, penile pain, and varying degrees of ED [2]. Contemporary management of ED and PD follows guidelines set by major urological associations. The American Urological Association (AUA) and European Association of Urology (EAU) emphasize patient education, risk factor modification, and shared decision-making [3,4,5]. There is growing interest in regenerative therapies such as low-intensity shockwave therapy (LI-SWT) [6] and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) [7] to improve outcomes [7]. However, none of the regenerative therapies are included in the guidelines, except for SWT included as a treatment option in the EAU guideline for mild vasculogenic ED [5].This comment seeks to establish an algorithm incorporating LI-SWT and PRP into the treatment pathways already established thus far so that patients may benefit from both the current offerings as well as novel approaches. The ultimate goal is to improve functional outcomes for men while preventing disease progression and increasing opportunities for therapy. With the incorporation of regenerative medicine, urologists will possess the knowledge to select the best patients and counsel them appropriately. The algorithms presented here are structured by disease severity (for ED) and phase (acute vs. chronic PD) to guide clinicians in personalized management.",

However, its high volatility and corrosive nature can degrade the perovskite layer and promote the formation of byproducts and pinholes in the hole transport layer under thermal stress, ultimately compromising device stability. Here we introduce a non-volatile, solid-state alternative—4-(N-carbazolyl)pyridine (4CP)—which stabilizes lithium ions and facilitates the formation of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide complexes. Perovskite solar cells incorporating 4CP achieve a power conversion efficiency of 26.2% (25.8% certified) and maintain 80% of their initial performance for over 3,000 h at maximum power point tracking. The unencapsulated devices retain 90% of their initial efficiency after 200 thermal shock cycles between −80 °C and 80 °C, and under continuous exposure to 65 °C and 85 °C. The adoption of 4CP could help improve the stability of n–i–p perovskite solar cells.",

    "title": "Bennu up close and mineralogical",
    "abstract": "The mineralogy of samples returned from asteroid Bennu yield valuable insights into the physical and chemical processes — on both small and large scales — that shape small bodies in the Solar System. On 24 September 2023, a capsule landed in Utah containing samples from the OSIRIS-REx mission to asteroid 101955 Bennu. It yielded 121.6 grams of rock, the largest mass returned from an asteroid to date. Curators and scientists in labs around the world have been carefully preparing and analysing the material since its return. In this issue ofNature Geoscience, we include articles reporting some of the first results obtained from the returned material, highlighting the mineralogical changes Bennu has experienced since its formation more than 4.5 billion years ago.Credit: NASA/Erika Blumenfeld and Joseph Aebersold OSIRIS-REx followed the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Hayabusa-2 mission that returned material from asteroid 162173 Ryugu in 2020. Both missions sampled some of the Solar System’s most primitive materials, similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. These are water-rich aggregates of dust and mineral grains that also contain organic carbon compounds and didn’t undergo extensive heating or melting on their precursor — or parent — asteroids. The rare CI (Ivuna-type) carbonaceous chondrites are the most chemically primitive of these, with elemental compositions closely matching the Sun. Sample return missions from primitive asteroids are critical to unlocking the formation and subsequent modification of materials comprising our early Solar System, as highlighted in previousNature Geoscienceeditorials1,2. Compared to meteorites collected on Earth, material sampled in situ and delivered by return missions is not altered by entry through the atmosphere or terrestrial weathering. Furthermore, while the spacecraft has an array of sensors for characterizing the surface of the asteroid, the high-precision analyses of tiny minerals and organic molecules needed to unravel the origins of asteroids can only be made in Earth-based laboratories. The results published so far have been intriguing. McCoy and colleagues3reported evidence for salt minerals formed during the evaporation of a brine during the early evolution of Bennu’s parent body, before it was broken apart by a later impact, raising the possibility that early asteroids were locations for prebiotic organic synthesis. Meanwhile, Glavin and colleagues4analysed organic molecules in Bennu material, detecting a range of compounds including amino acids, amines, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. They point out that these were formed and altered by low-temperature reactions on the parent asteroid, possibly in ammonia-rich fluids. Together, these studies suggest Bennu was fluid-rich shortly after it was formed. Writing in this issue, Zega and colleagueslook in more detailat the fluids circulating on Bennu’s parent asteroid. Using mineralogical evidence, they show how the composition of the fluid responsible for alteration may have changed with time, highlighting similarities between the inferred temperature conditions of alteration on Bennu, Ryugu and CI chondrite meteorites. Space weathering of minerals exposed on the surface of Bennu was also found to be extensive, with Keller and colleagues finding thatthe asteroid’s surface is a dynamic environment. Combining their results with those from Ryugu, they infer a larger role for micrometeorite impacts in space weathering than previously suggested, and highlight that space weathering on carbonaceous bodies is fundamentally different from that occurring on the Moon or other asteroid types. Overall, it appears that the chemical composition of Bennu is strikingly similar to the asteroid Ryugu5— despite the two bodies appearing very different on the surface — as well as CI chondrites. This suggests that this material is more common than its representation in meteorite collections on the Earth implies, and the possible implications of this finding are discussed in aCommentby Takaaki Noguchi. Meanwhile, our sister journalNature Astronomyrecently published an article on the sources of the materials accreted to Bennu’s parent body in the early Solar System. Here, Barnes et al. finddifferences between the Bennu, Ryugu and CI-chondrite materialsthat point to compositional heterogeneity in the Solar System region where these bodies formed. Together, these studies showcase the value of sample return missions — and the careful mineral-scale analyses they enable — for understanding the asteroids which ultimately contributed to building the Earth. Finally, we alsohighlighta recent image that witnesses how solar systems like our own were born, showing the condensation of the very first solid minerals from the gas that surrounds a newborn star. As Tamara Goldin notes, this image — and the minerals contained in early-formed asteroids like Bennu — capture the very beginnings of geoscience. Nat. Geosci.16, 833 (2023).Nat.

    "title": "Enhanced West Antarctic ice loss triggered by polynya response to meridional winds",
    "abstract": "West Antarctic outlet glaciers are in a stage of rapid ice loss, modulated by wind-driven exposure to warm ocean water. Rapid ice loss probably began in the mid-twentieth century and is often attributed to warmer ocean conditions near the ice shelves driven by strengthening westerly winds at the continental shelf break. This westerly wind trend is a feature of some historical climate simulations but is not supported by proxy (for example, ice-core, tree-ring) observations. Here we present an ensemble of regional ocean simulations and proxy-constrained climate reconstructions and show that shelf-break westerlies are a poor indicator of ocean conditions near the ice shelves. Instead, cumulative northerly wind anomalies close coastal polynyas (open-water regions), driving anomalous warming and freshening near the ice shelves, increasing ice-shelf melting. The increased meltwater leads to strengthening of the undercurrent that supplies warm water, further increasing melting. Our results highlight the importance of local northerly winds and associated sea ice changes for ice-shelf melting in West Antarctica. Proxy reconstructions show a significant historical northerly wind trend in this region, providing the atmospheric forcing that can explain the initiation of West Antarctic glacier retreat in the mid-twentieth century.",

Here we leverage the Broadbalk Classical Experiment at Rothamsted (UK), the world’s longest-running continuous winter wheat fertilization trial, along with14C labelling, metagenomics and metabolomics to determine how 180 years of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization impact soil organic carbon dynamics. Compared with no fertilization, long-term P, N and combined NP fertilization increased the soil organic carbon content by 10%, 22% and 28%, respectively. P application alone disproportionately increased microbial respiration (37%) and biomass (20%), limiting stable carbon formation and slightly increasing labile carbon. N application alone increased microbial carbon use and necromass accumulation efficiency, increasing mineral-associated carbon build-up. Combined NP fertilization enhanced plant-derived carbon inputs and the transformation of labile carbon into stable carbon, increasing soil organic carbon quantity and stability. A meta-analysis of the effects of fertilization duration on soil organic carbon revealed that N and P fertilization globally increased cropland soil organic carbon by 21% and 13%, and these promoting effects decreased before increasing after 16 and 34 years, respectively. Overall, long-term mineral fertilization can effectively enhance soil carbon sequestration.",

Using data from one of the largest non-profit platforms that matches private hosts with refugees, we compare the multidimensional integration outcomes of refugees who were matched with private hosts to those of observably similar refugees who applied for private hosting but were not matched (n= 1,700). Our findings show significant improvements in the social, psychological and navigational integration of privately hosted refugees, with no discernible effects on linguistic, economic or political integration. This study provides causal evidence on the effectiveness of private hosting in enhancing refugee integration, underscoring its potential to complement traditional public asylum reception and housing systems, and to harness civil society engagement for refugee integration during humanitarian crises.",

The study compared comprehensive genetic testing (324 genes) versus limited testing (87 genes) in 339 patients with advanced solid tumors to determine which approach yielded better treatment recommendations and clinical outcomes1. The comprehensive genetic panel demonstrated superior identification of potential treatments, detecting actionable targets in 52% of patients compared to 37% with the smaller panel, a notable 15%-point increase. Additionally, more patients received molecularly-targeted treatments with comprehensive testing (14% versus 9%). However, despite identifying more treatment options, the study found no improvement in patient survival or treatment response rates, highlighting a critical gap between genomic discovery and clinical benefit1. While this randomized controlled trial represents a valuable effort to provide patients with access to testing, several methodological limitations in its design, implementation and analysis may limit its generalizability and leave important questions for future research to address.",

    "abstract": "Itaconate is an immunomodulatory metabolite that alters mitochondrial metabolism and immune cell function. This organic acid is endogenously synthesized by tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolism downstream of TLR signalling. Itaconate-based treatment strategies are under investigation to mitigate numerous inflammatory conditions. However, little is known about the turnover rate of itaconate in circulation, the kinetics of its degradation and the broader consequences on metabolism. By combining mass spectrometry and in vivo13C itaconate tracing in male mice, we demonstrate that itaconate is rapidly eliminated from plasma, excreted via urine and fuels TCA cycle metabolism specifically in the liver and kidneys. Our results further reveal that itaconate is converted into acetyl-CoA, mesaconate and citramalate. Itaconate administration also influences branched-chain amino acid metabolism and succinate levels, indicating a functional impact on succinate dehydrogenase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity in male rats and mice. Our findings uncover a previously unknown aspect of itaconate metabolism, highlighting its rapid catabolism in vivo that contrasts findings in cultured cells.",

Currently, vCLEM alignment relies on time-consuming and subjective manual methods. This paper presents CLEM-Reg, an algorithm that automates the three-dimensional alignment of vCLEM datasets by leveraging probabilistic point cloud registration techniques. Point clouds are derived from segmentations of common structures in each modality, created by state-of-the-art open-source methods. CLEM-Reg drastically reduces the registration time of vCLEM datasets to a few minutes and achieves correlation of fluorescent signal to submicron target structures in electron microscopy on three newly acquired vCLEM benchmark datasets. CLEM-Reg was then used to automatically obtain vCLEM overlays to unambiguously identify TGN46-positive transport carriers involved in protein trafficking between the trans-Golgi network and plasma membrane. Datasets are available on EMPIAR and BioStudies, and a napari plugin is provided to aid end-user adoption.",

Multidomain peptides assemble into supramolecular hydrogels with a well-defined, highly porous nanostructure that makes them attractive for drug delivery. However, their ability to extend release is typically limited by rapid drug diffusion. Here, to overcome this challenge, we present self-assembling boronate ester release (SABER) multidomain peptides capable of engaging in dynamic covalent bonding with payloads containing boronic acids. As examples, we demonstrate that SABER hydrogels can prolong the release of boronic acid-containing small-molecule drugs and boronic acid-modified biologics such as insulin and antibodies. Pharmacokinetic studies reveal that SABER hydrogels extend the therapeutic effect of ganfeborole from days to weeks, preventingMycobacterium tuberculosisgrowth compared with oral administration in an infection model. Similarly, SABER hydrogels extended insulin activity, maintaining normoglycemia for 6 days in diabetic mice after a single injection. These results suggest that SABER hydrogels present broad potential for clinical translation.",

However, the limited light–matter interaction lengths in metasurfaces typically require high driving voltages exceeding tens of volts to achieve satisfactory modulation. Here we present low-voltage, high-speed free-space optical modulators based on silicon-organic-hybrid metasurfaces with dimerized-grating-based nanostructures. By exploiting a high-Qresonant mode, normally incident light is effectively trapped within a submicrometre-scale silicon slot region embedded with organic electro-optic material. Consequently, highly efficient modulation is obtained, enabling data transmission at 50 Mbps and 1.6 Gbps with driving voltages of only 0.2 V and 1 V, respectively. These metasurface modulators can now operate at complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor-compatible voltage levels, allowing energy-efficient high-speed practical applications of active metasurfaces.",

    "abstract": "Grid cells, with their periodic firing fields, are fundamental units in neural networks that perform path integration. It is widely assumed that grid cells encode movement in a single, global reference frame. In this study, by recording grid cell activity in mice performing a self-motion-based navigation task, we discovered that grid cells did not have a stable grid pattern during the task. Instead, grid cells track the animal movement in multiple reference frames within single trials. Specifically, grid cells reanchor to a task-relevant object through a translation of the grid pattern. Additionally, the internal representation of movement direction in grid cells drifted during self-motion navigation, and this drift predicted the mouse’s homing direction. Our findings reveal that grid cells do not operate as a global positioning system but rather estimate position within multiple local reference frames.",

However, the limited performance of solution-processed blue LEDs, particularly their short operation lifetime, is hindering their practical use in display technologies. Here we demonstrate that trace water in the device—previously considered detrimental to most solution-processed LEDs—dramatically enhances the performance of quantum-dot LEDs. This breakthrough stems from our comprehensive mechanism investigations into the positive aging phenomenon, a long-standing puzzle in the quantum-dot LED field. Our findings reveal that water passivation on the surface of electron-transporting layers, which are composed of zinc-oxide-based nanoparticles, improves charge transport and enhances exciton radiative recombination by suppressing hole leakage during device operation. Combined with the advanced top-emitting architecture, our blue quantum-dot LEDs achieve a high current efficiency of 37.1 cd A−1, a blue index (colour-coordinate-corrected current efficiency) of over 490 cd A−1\\({{\\rm{CIE}}}_{y}^{-1}\\)and unprecedented stability, with an extrapolatedT95lifetime (at an initial brightness of 1,000 cd m−2) of 287 h.

Currently, the CBAM applies to iron and steel, cement, aluminium, fertilizers, electricity and hydrogen. As the European Union considers extending the CBAM to chemicals by 2030, its effectiveness in this complex industry remains uncertain. Here we assess how well the CBAM would capture emissions in the chemical industry by using the life-cycle assessment data of 4,470 global chemical production facilities, focusing on the key products ethylene and polyethylene. We find that the current CBAM framework would cover 50–60% of production emissions for these products, leaving substantial upstream emissions unpriced. This limited emission coverage risks compromising the policy’s climate ambition and distorts market incentives. To improve effectiveness, the CBAM would need to expand to include fossil feedstocks and refinery products, and implement high fallback default values for embodied emissions to incentivize data reporting. Our findings highlight the need for detailed supply chain tracking and early engagement with chemical industry stakeholders to ensure that the CBAM supports a fair and effective net-zero transition.",

    "abstract": "Agroecological droughts are expected to increase with climate change, becoming one of the greatest threats to ecosystems and human society. To mitigate climate change and the growing risk of agroecological droughts, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is increasingly recognized as unavoidable. However, it remains unclear whether the increase of agroecological drought due to atmospheric CO2emissions will be symmetrically reversed by an equivalent atmospheric CDR. Here we investigate this question by utilizing an idealized atmospheric CO2emission and removal experiment from the CDR Model Intercomparison Project, involving eight Earth system models, and develop a new methodology to quantify climate hysteresis and reversibility. We find that drought increases in hotspot regions cannot be symmetrically reversed by an equivalent CDR: drought severity under the CDR pathway is 65% ± 30% greater than under the emission pathway; drought frequency increases are only partially reversed by 73% ± 18% when CO2emissions are balanced by equivalent CDR. Drought hysteresis and irreversibility are most pronounced in the Mediterranean, northern Central America, west and east southern Africa and southern Australia. Our findings imply irreversible drought impacts associated with CDR, highlighting the need for planning long-term drought adaptations.",

Using bioinformatic analyses, EOC tissues, primary tumor cells and organoids, and chemoresistant cell lines, we identified lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) as a candidate, whose expression was increased in both platinum-resistant and PARPi-resistant tumors. Moreover, LEF1 deficiency increased EOC cell sensitivity to cisplatin and PARPi in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LEF1 knockdown promoted double-strand breaks and significantly impaired both homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining by directly downregulating the transcription of PARP1 and NUMA1. In addition, the LEF1 inhibitor niclosamide increased ovarian cancer sensitivity to Cisplatin and PARPi in patient-derived organoids and Niraparib-resistant cell lines. These findings indicate that LEF1 is a potential therapeutic target for overcoming resistance to chemotherapy based on platinum and PARPi in EOC.",

However, the regulatory network and how cholesterol biosynthesis contribute to TNBC development and progression are not well elucidated. Here, we found that reticulum membrane protein complex 2 (EMC2) is highly expressed in TNBC and predicts short survival of patients. In vitro and in vivo experiments displayed that EMC2 could promote TNBC growth. We also displayed that EMC2 could increase intracellular cholesterol biosynthesis by regulating Farnesyltransferase 1 (FDFT1) expression. Mechanistically, we validated that EMC2 interacted with heat shock protein 90(HSP90) to sustain FDFT1 protein quality and correctly located in the ER membrane through protecting it from endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD). Furthermore, EMC2 decreased TNBC cell ferroptosis susceptibility through elevating intracellular cholesterol contents. Collectively, our findings shed a new insight that EMC2 is critical for boosting cholesterol biosynthesis and ferroptosis resistance.

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is a highly aggressive malignancy with a dismal prognosis, characterized by a complex tumor microenvironment that promotes immunosuppression and limits the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is overexpressed in the tumor stroma and represents a promising target for therapeutic intervention. Here, we developed a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting FAP, and investigated its anti-tumor activity and ability to enhance ICB efficacy in pancreatic cancer. We conjugated a humanized anti-FAP antibody with the potent topoisomerase I inhibitor exatecan to generate a novel FAP-targeting ADC (FAP-ADC) with a drug-to-antibody ratio of eight. The cytotoxicity and internalization of FAP-ADC were evaluated in vitro using FAP-expressing cell lines, and its anti-tumor activity was assessed in vivo using cell-derived xenograft models. Mechanistic studies revealed that FAP-ADC synergistically improved the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 antibody in vivo by leading to an increased level of M1-polarized macrophages and reduced abundance of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, FAP-ADC treatment enhanced the infiltration of CD8+T cells into the tumor and upregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Combination therapy with FAP-ADC and anti-PD-L1 antibodies resulted in superior anti-tumor efficacy compared to either monotherapy. Collectively, our novel FAP-targeting ADC exerts potent anti-tumor activity in pancreatic cancer by selectively depleting FAP-expressing cells and reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The combination of FAP-ADC with ICB therapy represents a promising therapeutic strategy to improve the treatment outcomes for patients with this fatal cancer.",

Yet these associations were substantially attenuated among children with higher childcare hours, suggesting a protective effect mediated through improved executive functioning. Importantly, this buffering effect depended on both the quantity of care and the responsiveness of caregivers, underscoring that simply expanding access is insufficient; the quality and stability of care matter profoundly.",

    "title": "Biomarkers in neonatal encephalopathy: the role of high-mobility group box 1 in prognosis and potential therapy",
    "abstract": "Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) affects 1.15 m babies per annum globally and is an important cause of neonatal death and disability such as Cerebral Palsy.1Standardised blood biomarkers of severity, prognosis and response to therapy are lacking although multiple biomarkers have been described and validated. Systemic inflammation is associated with the severity of NE as well as the neuroimaging and developmental outcomes.2,3 The systemic inflammatory response with both pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines responses is only mildly affected by therapeutic hypothermia.2,3,4,5,6,7,8Further understanding of the pathophysiology, phases of injury, and therapeutic windows for present and future neuroprotective interventions in term newborns is vital.8Neuroimaging biomarkers have been used in clinical trials such as the Lactate/NAA ratio on spectroscopy on MRI9but serial measurements are not readily available at multiple early timepoints or through childhood. Therefore, inflammatory markers have shown promise as prognostic biomarkers for outcomes of NE.3Clinical trials are increasingly utilising blood biochemical biomarkers as surrogate outcomes rather than waiting several years for neurodevelopmental outcomes. These biomarkers may potentially help to stratify patient groups for suitable interventions in more complex study designs. Rui et al. retrospectively analysed 216 infants both term and preterm diagnosed with encephalopathy and found those with a poor prognosis had increased serum high-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1).10Decreases in HMGB1 over time were associated with a good prognosis but increases were associated with a poor prognosis. An Apgar score of 0–3 at 5 min, extremely preterm birth, premature rupture of membranes, moderate to severe NE and serum HMGB1 > 6.14 ng/mL were associated with a poor prognosis as an independent risk factor. HMGB1 levels correlated with Interleukin (IL)-6 and CRP indicating inflammatory status in NE. This paper included predominantly extremely low birthweight infants and only 40 term infants were included and details of therapy such as TH were not reported.11,12,13,14The authors extrapolated term infant definitions of NE to preterm infants which is controversial as there are currently no consensus guidelines for encephalopathy in preterm infants.15The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) describes NE as a “clinically defined syndrome of disturbed neurologic function in the earliest days of life in an infant born at or beyond 35 weeks of gestation, manifested by a subnormal level of consciousness or seizures, and often accompanied by difficulty with initiating and maintaining respiration and depression of tone and reflexes”.10This heterogeneous patient group including term NE and preterm infants with HI highlight the need for further studies using consensus definitions and stratifying by gestation.High mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) is also named amphoterin and high-mobility group protein 1 (HMG-1) and is encoded by theHMGB1gene.16Nuclear HMGB1 inside the cell, regulates the structure and function of chromosomes and is bound extensively to DNA which is important in DNA replication, telomere maintenance, nucleosome assembly and transcriptional regulation. Extracellular HMGB1 can be passively released by necrotic tissue or stressed cells or actively secreted and mediates inflammation, metabolic responses and immunity. It acts as a cytokine and is a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) protein binding to pattern recognition receptors (PRR)such as Toll-like receptors17and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), which control proinflammatory cytokine release. Targeting HMGB1 release and activity has potential for the treatment of neonatal sepsis and encephalopathy. Therapeutic hypothermia remains the only standardised treatment with the decrease of core temperature to 33–34 °C for 72 h and a number needed to treat of 7. However ~50% of survivors have disability18,19and adjunctive therapies are the focus of ongoing studies. HMGB1 has been implicated in neurological disorders including sepsis-induced encephalopathy in adults.20Although there are limited data available about the role of HMGB1 in neuroinflammation following sepsis, it has been implicated in other neurologic disorders and causes blood-brain barrier damage when translocating to the extracellular space from the nucleus causing neuroinflammatory responses. Anti-HMGB1 antibodies and antagonists such glycyrrhizin or HMGB1 interference (shRNA)inhibit the neuroinflammatory response post-traumatic brain injury and subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH).21Neonatal microglia in hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy have upregulated HMGB1 and can alter M1/M2 phenotypic polarization, leading to cortical injury. HMGB1 could be a factor in HI-related brain injury in the newborn, analogous to adult stroke. HMGB1 was upregulated in activated microglia after HI in a neonatal model and inhibition of HMGB1 with glycyrrhizin decreased hippocampal neuronal and microglial loss and neurobehavioral abnormalities were reduced.11,22 Larger human neonatal studies or collaborative projects including term infants with neonatal encephalopathy detailing study design, aetiology and management would allow the validation of HMGB1 and correlation with short and longer-term outcomes. In vitro human immune response to glycyrrhizin could be developed for future human clinical trials. Therefore, HMGB1 may act as biomarker of injury and also a target for immunomodulation in clinical trials. Lee, A. C. et al.

    "title": "Dietary lignan intake and body fat distribution in U.S. adolescents",
    "abstract": "BackgroundBody fat distribution patterns impact adolescent health, yet research on dietary lignans’ influence remains limited. This study investigated their association among U.S. adolescents.MethodsData from 1579 adolescents (NHANES 2003–2006) were analyzed. Urinary enterolactone and enterodiol concentrations measured dietary lignan intake. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry assessed body fat distribution. Survey-weighted linear regression models with progressive adjustment were employed, and restricted cubic spline analyses evaluated potential non-linear relationships.ResultsUrinary enterolactone levels were significantly inversely associated with android-to-gynoid fat ratio (fully adjusted model:β= −0.007, 95% CI: −0.012, −0.002,P= 0.008), indicating a significant negative relationship between enterolactone and android-to-gynoid fat ratio, with restricted cubic spline analysis confirming significant overall association (P for overall = 0.001, demonstrating the statistical significance of the entire relationship) and linear relationship (P for nonlinear = 0.064, indicating the relationship does not significantly deviate from linearity). Further analysis showed that enterodiol was positively associated with gynoid fat ratio (β= 0.360, 95% CI: 0.043, 0.677,P= 0.028), suggesting enterodiol exposure may favor gynoid fat distribution.ConclusionDietary lignan intake significantly associates with more favorable body fat distribution patterns among U.S. adolescents, suggesting that increasing dietary lignan intake may be a potential strategy for improving adolescent body composition.ImpactDietary lignan intake, measured by urinary biomarkers, is significantly associated with favorable body fat distribution patterns in U.S. adolescents.This study highlights the role of dietary lignans, an underexplored dietary component, in influencing body fat distribution during adolescence, expanding on prior research focused on adults.These findings suggest dietary lignans as a potential nutritional strategy to improve body fat distribution in adolescents, offering insights for public health interventions targeting metabolic health in youth.",

    "abstract": "The rapid decline in global biodiversity highlights the urgent need for conservation efforts, with botanical gardens playing a crucial role inex situplant preservation. Monumental plants, such as the 400-year-old Goethe’s Palm (Chamaerops humilisL.) at the Padua Botanical Garden serve as vital flagship species with significant ecological and cultural value. In this study, we present the first chromosome-level genome assembly ofC. humilis, using PacBio HiFi and Arima Hi-C sequencing technologies. The assembled genome spans 4.41 Gbp with a scaffold N50 length of 195 Mbp and it includes 18 pseudo-chromosomes. Repetitive elements constituted approximately 88% of the genome, with Long Terminal Repeats (LTR) alone comprising 63%. A total of 28,321 protein-coding genes were predicted and annotated. The Goethe’s Palm genome assembly is a valuable resource for exploring both its cultural and historical significance, as well as the genetic basis of adaptive traits that allow this palm to thrive in Mediterranean environments.",

    "title": "Vibration analysis and optimal design of tracked vehicle’s seat suspension for improving combat efficiency",
    "abstract": "The tracked vehicle (TV) primarily operates on poor road surfaces, which means the vibration excitation of the road surface significantly impacts the driver’s sighting efficiency and driving comfort. This is the cause of reduced vehicle combat efficiency. To address this, based on the dynamic interaction model between the TV, Seat, and Driver established in Matlab/Simulink software, all the dynamic parameters of the suspension system of the TV and seat are then simulated under different operation conditions of the TV. The sighting efficiency and driving comfort of the driver evaluated via the root mean square of the relative displacement between the TV’s body and driver (zw), and the driver’s head acceleration in the vertical direction are chosen as two evaluation indexes. The results indicate that the operating conditions as well as the dynamic parameters of the TV greatly influence the sighting efficiency and driving comfort of the driver. By using the seat’s new suspension added by optimized NSS (negative stiffness structure), bothzwandawz1are strongly reduced in comparison with the seat’s old suspension, especially,zwandawz1are remarkably reduced by 63% and 62% compared to the seat’s old suspension when the TV is moving on ISO-E class road surface at 60 km/h. Therefore, the seat’s new suspension greatly improves the sighting efficiency and driving comfort of the driver. In addition, the addition of NSS to the TV’s seat suspension is completely feasible in the actual condition of the TV. This is a very practical study to improve the TV’s combat efficiency.",

    "title": "An Eocene shallow water isselicrinid sea lilies from the Northern Hemisphere",
    "abstract": "Stalked crinoids are uncommon fossils in the Cenozoic. This is particularly due to their continuous decline starting from the Late Cretaceous and gradual restriction to the deep-sea environment, which bears a fossil record bias. On the other hand, in recent times, new data have emerged documenting some relict populations of sea lilies in the shallow marine facies from the Cenozoic. Here, we report shallow-water occurrences of Eocene crinoids from Romania that are classified asIsselicrinus. The representatives ofIsselicrinusreached their greatest palaeogeographic distribution during the Eocene in offshore environments, and the only find of these crinoids from shallow-water facies was from the Southern Hemisphere. Thus, our discovery documents the first Eocene shallow-water occurrence of this taxon from the Northern Hemisphere. This finding shows that isocrinids locally might have remained in shallow environments after the initiation of the so-called Mesozoic marine revolution (MMR).",

    "title": "Characterization and experimental investigation of powdered filtration sludge for potential utilization in construction industry",
    "abstract": "Rapid sand filtration is typically used at water treatment plants to remove the fine suspended solid particles from the raw water. Backwashing of exhausted filter beds inevitably generates large volume of filtration sludge in water treatment plants. In this study, filtration sludge is collected, dried and crushed to powder, then passed through 90 µm sieve to get powdered filtration sludge (PFS) which is then characterized and utilized without energy intensive process of calcination. The PFS is blended with cement up to 20% and investigated for various properties to assess the possibility of its utilization in construction industry. Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) mortar or control mortar when substituted with up to 15% PFS has compressive strength above 33 MPa at 28 days and above 41 MPa at 90 days and setting times within prescribed limits. OPC blended with PFS up to 15% conforms various specifications desired for use in different construction practices especially where early strength is not essential. Utilization of filtration sludge as partial cement replacement in mortar would provide a beneficial and sustainable disposal alternative. Simultaneously it will reduce the cement consumption depending on the extent of its utilization. Consequently, it would help in conserving the natural resources, reducing the carbon emission and its related impact on the environment.",

    "title": "Characterization of the extrinsic and intrinsic signatures and therapeutic vulnerability of small cell lung cancers",
    "abstract": "Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), an aggressive neuroendocrine tumor strongly associated with exposure to tobacco carcinogens, is characterized by early dissemination and dismal prognosis with a five-year overall survival of less than 7%. High-frequency gain-of-function mutations in oncogenes are rarely reported, and intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) remains to be determined in SCLC. Here, via multiomics analyses of 314 SCLCs, we found that theASCL1+/MKI67+andASCL1+/CRIP2+clusters accounted for 74.38% of the 190,313 SCLC cancer cells from 39 patients, with theASCL1+SOX1+stem-like cell cluster across SCLC subtypes. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules were expressed at low levels in six and high levels in five cancer cell clusters and were inversely associated with the KI67 expression level. Abnormal splicing of mRNAs was a feature of SCLC, with focal adhesion kinase (FAK) splicing variants identified in 119 (77.3%) of 154 patients. FAK variants exhibited elevated kinase activity, were associated with the worst prognosis, and were sensitive to FAK inhibitors in patient-derived organoids and xenograft models. Eleven high-frequency mutations were identified in addition toTP53andRB1, and smoking status and tumor stage did not affect microbiota variance in SCLC. Taken together, our data further revealed the complicated ITH and discovered that FAK splicing variants represent high-frequency gain-of-function alterations in oncogene in SCLC and potential therapeutic targets for this recalcitrant cancer.",

Participants completed remote, group-based handcycling at moderate-vigorous intensity twice weekly for 12 weeks, co-led by a physiotherapist and peer with SCI/D. Handcycling duration was progressively increased to 45 min. Outcome measures were completed at three timepoints (pre-, post-, 12 weeks post-training). True change was assessed using the two-standard deviation band method for the Spinal Cord Independence Measure, Moorong Self-Efficacy Scale, Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale (ESES), Positive Affect and Well-Being Scale, and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and minimal detectable change for the 6 min Push Test (6MPT). Semi-structured interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis.ResultsFive participants enrolled; four completed the program and one was withdrawn following fractures unrelated to program. Overall, divergence was observed when comparing quantitative and qualitative findings. Interview data revealed participants perceived physical, psychological, and social health improvements, but there was minimal change in quantitative scores. A few instances of convergence were noted; e.g., immediately post-intervention, SP01 experienced improvement in 6MPT distance, which corroborated SP01’s perceived physical health improvements. At 12-week follow-up, SP03 experienced reduction in ESES score, which aligned with SP03’s reports of skin issues limiting sport.ConclusionsRemote handcycling provided some health benefits for participants with SCI/D aged ≥50 years.",

    "abstract": "A ketogenic diet (KD) has shown promise as an adjunctive therapy for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder (MDD). We examined tolerance for a KD in young adults with MDD and assessed symptoms of depression and metabolic health. Students (n= 24) with a confirmed diagnosis of MDD at baseline receiving standard of care counseling and/or medication treatment were enrolled in a 10–12 week KD intervention that included partial provision of ketogenic-appropriate food items, frequent dietary counseling, and daily morning tracking of capillaryR-beta-hydroxybutyrate (R-BHB). Primary outcome measures for mood symptoms included the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). Additional outcomes included body composition, neurocognitive function, and blood hormonal and inflammatory markers. Sixteen students (10 women, 6 men, mean age 24 yr) completed the intervention. Nutritional ketosis (R-BHB > 0.5 mM) was achieved 73% of the time. Depressive symptoms decreased by 69% (PHQ-9) and 71% (HRSD) post-intervention (p< 0.001), with improvement occurring within 2–6 weeks. Global well-being increased nearly 3-fold (p< 0.001). Participants lost body mass (−6.2%;p= 0.002) and fat mass (−13.0%;p< 0.001). Serum leptin decreased (−52%;p= 0.009) and brain-derived neurotropic factor increased (+32%;p= 0.029). Performance improved on several cognitive tasks. In students with mild to moderate depression based on PHQ-9 and HRSD, implementation of a WFKD for 10–12 weeks is a feasible adjunctive therapy and may be associated with improvements in depression symptoms, well-being, body composition, and cognition.",

    "title": "Outcome after Treosulfan-based conditioning in a real-world MDS cohort",
    "abstract": "Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is the only curative treatment for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), offering superior survival compared to non-transplant therapies [1,2]. However, since myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) mainly affect older patients, the decision for allo-SCT must balance risks and benefits. Advances in transplant include the introduction of Treosulfan as reduced-toxicity conditioning, based on results from the randomized controlled (RCT) phase-III MC-FludT.14/L-trial comparing Fludarabine/Treosulfan (Flu/Treo) with reduced intensity Fludarabine/Busulfan. Here, Flu/Treo led to an improved overall survival (OS) in patients with MDS or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) due to reduced non-relapse mortality (NRM) and comparable relapse rates [3,4]. With great interest we read the report by Stelljes et al. who performed a real-world (RW) analysis on Flu/Treo conditioning in MDS presenting comparable results among the RW setting and the RCT [5]. However, data on patient-, disease- and transplant-related factors potentially influencing outcome after Flu/Treo conditioning in MDS are limited. Therefore, this retrospective analysis aimed to evaluate RW outcomes after Flu/Treo in MDS and to analyse which patient-, disease- and transplant-related factors impact posttransplant outcome with focus on disease burden and pretransplant strategy. In-/exlusion criteria are shown in the Supplement. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (approval number: 22-10708-BO) and patients provided written informed consent. Data cut-off was November 1, 2022. Definitions, response assessment and statistical methods are described in the Supplement.Sixty-one patients matching the inclusion criteria allografted between 2010 and 2022 were included. Ninety percent (n= 55) were >50 years and median age was 60 years (range 25–76). Hematopoietic cell transplant-comorbidity index (HCT-CI) was low/intermediate in 46% and high in 54% of patients. Median blast count pretransplant was 8% (range 0–17). Abnormal karyotype was present in 56% with complex karyotype in 17 patients. Based on IPSS-R, 70% had high/very high-risk disease. Regarding pretransplant strategy, 47% received upfront allo-SCT, while 46% and 7% received hypomethylating agents (HMA) or intensive chemotherapy. Among treated patients, 41% achieved complete remission (CR), while 59% had active disease pretransplant. Most patients received transplant from matched unrelated (62%), followed by matched related (16%), mismatched unrelated (15%) and haploidentical donors (7%). In-vivo T-cell depletion was performed in 79%, either using ATG or post-transplant cyclophosphamide (n= 9). For further analyses we dichotomized patients according to pretransplant bone marrow (BM) blast count into those with higher (≥10%,n= 20) and those with lower (<10%,n= 41) disease burden. Regarding different patient-, disease- and transplant characteristics no differences besides a higher amount of de novo compared to therapy-related MDS (t-MDS) in the group with ≥10% BM blasts were observed. Baseline characteristics are summarized in Supplementary Table1for the entire cohort and for patients with <10% and ≥10% BM blasts pretransplant.After a median follow-up of 42 months (range 1–143), median RFS and OS were 40 (range 0.9–143) and 57 months (range 1–143). The estimated 2-year RFS, OS, CIR and NRM rates were 63%, 68%, 18% and 22% (Fig.1). Engraftment data, day +100 mortality and GvHD incidence are depicted in the Supplementary Table2. We further analyzed impact of patient-, disease- and transplant-specific factors on outcomes after Flu/Treo. In univariable analysis, abnormal karyotype was associated with inferior RFS (p= 0.009, HR 3.1 [1.3–7.5]) and OS (p= 0.004, HR 3.7 [1.4–9.7]) and complex karyotype also negatively impacted RFS (p= 0.048, HR 2.1 [0.99–4.6]). Pretreatment trended towards worse RFS (p= 0.09, HR 1.96 [0.9–4.3]) and showed inferior OS (p= 0.04, HR 2.3 [0.99–5.5]) in contrast to upfront allo-SCT. In contrast, unrelated donor transplant (p= 0.07, HR 0.48 [0.22–1.1]) and in-vivo T-cell depletion (p= 0.06, HR 0.47 [0.2–1.04]) showed a trend towards improved RFS. Interestingly, BM blasts pretransplant did not affect outcome, regardless of thresholds (<5%/<10%). Additionally, older age (≥58 years) was associated with reduced relapse risk (p= 0.03), but also increased NRM by trend (p= 0.09) resulting in comparable RFS and OS to younger patients. Furthermore high HCT-CI was linked to higher NRM (p= 0.01), however this did not result in decreased OS (p= 0.1). To avoid overfitting in multivariable analysis for OS/RFS, the number of covariables was limited to three based on the amount of events observed. Based on the results from univariable analysis (p< 0.1) and on clinical relevance we chose karyotype, pretransplant strategy and BM blasts to be incorporated in the multivariable model. Here, elevated BM blasts (≥10%) showed no statistical significant impact on RFS/OS. In contrast abnormal karyotype and pretransplant cytoreduction clearly predicted worse OS, but not RFS. Results for univariable/multivariable analyses are depicted in Supplementary Tables3and4.Fig. 1: Posttransplant Outcome after Flu/Treo conditioning in MDS.This Figure depicts posttransplant outcome in terms of Overall Survival (a), Relapse-Free Survival (b), Relapse Incidence (c) and Non-Relapse Mortality (d) as well as Overall Survival depending on karyotype (e), pretransplant strategy (f) and BM blast count prior allo-SCT (g).

On the other hand disease burden in terms of BM blasts pretransplant had no impact.Our RW cohort is comparable to the population in the RCT in terms of age (median 60 years in both groups) and a high HCT-CI (>3) (RW 54% vs RCT 58%) indicating a relevant risk for NRM in both populations. Accordingly, NRM was similar between the cohorts (RW 22% vs RCT 21%). While 50% in the RCT and 47% in our RW cohort received upfront transplantation, 33% of our RW patients had ≥10% BM blasts pretransplant - a variable not reported in the RCT. Furthermore, 70% of our patients exhibited a high/very high IPSS-R risk compared to 55% in the RCT, which may explain the higher relapse rate in our cohort (2-year CIR 18% vs. 11%). Consequently, 2-year RFS (63%) and OS (68%) were slightly lower compared to the RCT (68% and 73%), but still remarkable and thereby underline efficacy of Flu/Treo in high risk MDS [3,4,5]. In our multivariable analyses, abnormal karyotype and pre-transplant debulking was associated with lower OS after Flu/Treo, yet disease burden pretransplant reflected by BM blast count did not. This is in line with findings by Murdock et al., showing that in older AML patients transplant outcomes are determined by baseline genetics, not by disease burden [6]. Furthermore, also a recent EBMT analysis suggested no benefit of pre-transplant debulking [7]. In accordance with our results Stelljes et al. did not report a significant impact of BM blasts (<10% vs. 10–20%) on OS after Flu/Treo [5]. Interestingly, while abnormal karyotype and pretransplant cytoreduction adversely affected OS, they did not influence RFS, suggesting similar relapse rates but poorer response to salvage therapy in case of posttransplant relapse. One possible explanation is that clonal selection during pretransplant cytoreduction may result in more resistant disease at relapse. However, this hypothesis remains speculative and should be addressed in prospective studies.Altogether, despite its retrospective design and small sample size our results suggest the following implications for clinical practice: (1) Flu/Treo conditioning is safe and effective in MDS independent of pretransplant BM blast count. (2) Pre-transplant cytoreduction has no benefit, but might even be disadvantageous. (3) The lacking impact of pretransplant disease burden on outcome after Flu/Treo challenges the common use of sequential conditioning which is largely based on retrospective data in patients with higher blast count [8] and emphasizes the need for prospective trials comparing sequential versus Flu/Treo conditioning. (4) However, also Flu/Treo seems not to be able to overcome disease-specific, non modifiable risk of adverse genetics asking for incorporation of novel approaches into conditioning.

    "abstract": "For over two decades, the EBMT has updated recommendations on indications for haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) practice based on clinical and scientific developments in the field. This is the ninth special EBMT report on indications for HCT for haematological diseases, solid tumours and immune disorders. Our aim is to provide guidance on HCT indications according to prevailing clinical practice in EBMT countries and centres. In order to inform patient decisions, these recommendations must be considered with the risk of the disease, risk of HCT procedure and non-HCT strategies, including evolving cellular therapies, and their availability on site. HCT techniques are constantly evolving and we make no specific recommendations, but encourage harmonisation of practice, where possible, to ensure experience across indications can be meaningfully aggregated via registry outputs. We also recommend working according to JACIE certification standards to maintain quality in clinical and laboratory practice, including benchmarking of survival outcomes [1,2,3]. Since the last edition, innovative cellular and gene therapies have entered in activity across indications affecting clinical decision making. As the number and type of regulatory authority-approved cellular therapies grow, recommendations for best practice and quality of patient care were developed to support clinicians and will be regularly updated.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDocetaxel is the most common chemotherapy regimen for several neoplasms, including advanced OSCC (Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma). Unfortunately, chemoresistance leads to relapse and adverse disease outcomes.MethodsWe performed CRISPR-based kinome screening to identify potential players of Docetaxel resistance. Immunohistochemistry was performed to examine the expression profile of the target gene across tumour tissues. Global transcriptome analysis was performed to determine the molecular mechanism underlying Docetaxel resistance. NEK9 kinase assay was performed to identify a putative kinase inhibitor.ResultsUpon conducting CRISPR-based kinome screening, Never In Mitosis Gene-A Related Kinase-9 (NEK9) was identified as a major player of Docetaxel resistance in OSCC, prostate, and pancreatic cancer lines. NEK9 expression was found to be upregulated in chemotherapy non-responder OSCC patients as compared to responders. NEK9 ablation restores Docetaxel-induced cell death in chemoresistant cells. Mechanistically, we found that NEK9 deletion upregulates Transducin-like enhancer protein 3 (TLE3), which in turn represses Wnt signalling. Fostamatinib was identified as a potent NEK9 inhibitor that overcomes Docetaxel resistance.ConclusionsOur study demonstrated that NEK9 plays an important role in Docetaxel resistance. The novel combination of NEK9 inhibitor Fostamatinib and Docetaxel needs further clinical investigation in advanced OSCC.",

The protein interaction was analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation. The expressions ofSLC7A11-AS1and activin A in tissue microarray were analyzed by FISH and immunofluerescence. Tumor xenograft mice models were established for in vivo experiments.ResultsOverexpression ofSLC7A11-AS1enhanced the activin A-induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation and promoted cancer stemness properties in PDAC cells. Mechanically,SLC7A11-AS1interacts with scaffold protein RSL1D1. This interaction disrupts PPM1A myristoylation by suppressing the recruitment of PPM1A and myristoyltransferase NMT1 to RSL1D1, leading to prolonged activation of activin A/Smad signaling through the delay of Smad2/3 dephosphorylation. Co-overexpression ofSLC7A11-AS1and activin A were found in pancreatic patients, and related with the extremely short survival periods. Knockdown ofSLC7A11-AS1and blockade of activin A signaling significantly reduced gemcitabine resistance in PDAC in vitro and in vivo.ConclusionsSLC7A11-AS1contributes to prolonged activation of activin A/Smad signaling by suppressing PPM1A myristoylation.

    "abstract": "BackgroundMulti-cancer detection (MCED) blood tests have the potential to screen for early-stage cancers. Understanding how people experience an MCED cancer signal result is vital prior to any future implementation. We explored experiences in a trial context.MethodsA subset of 41 participants in the NHS-Galleri trial (NCT05611632), with a cancer signal detected result, were interviewed. We selected: 20 participants with cancer found (self-reported) and 21 without cancer (following tests). Transcripts were analysed thematically.ResultsExpectations of cancer played a pivotal role in emotional, cognitive and social responses, and were influenced by participants’ experiences of health and symptoms. While the cancer signal was often unexpected, the predicted cancer signal origin made sense when consistent with family history or health issues. During the period of diagnostic uncertainty, views of healthiness or lack of family history were sometimes used to self-reassure. For some, a cancer diagnosis was unexpected; for others, expectations of cancer had gradually increased. For those without cancer, believing that it could be present affected their sense of reassurance.DiscussionInformation about the meaning of a cancer signal will be needed if MCED screening is implemented.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the incidence of thyroid carcinoma (TC). Our study focuses on the regulatory effect of circular RNAs on metabolism of TC, aiming to provide new insights into the mechanisms of progression and a potential therapeutic target for TC. In this study, we identified high expression levels of circPSD3 in TC tissues through RNA sequencing. Papillary thyroid cancer tissue cohorts verified the circPSD3 expression level was positively correlated with larger tumor size. circPSD3 promoted the proliferation of TC cells and reduced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Proteomics and metabolomics suggested that circPSD3 might play a crucial role in regulating the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Specifically, circPSD3 acted as a miR-338-5p sponge to upregulate SUCLG2, an enzyme of the TCA cycle, which accelerates the conversion of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) to succinate. Knockdown of circPSD3 disrupts the TCA cycle and impairs mitochondrial function, resulting in decreased membrane potential and aerobic respiration rate. The reduction in mitochondrial function resulted in the inhibition of proliferation and initiation of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "Adverse intrauterine environments, such as hyperglycemia, impair sexual reproduction and species continuity, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that intrauterine hyperglycemia significantly disrupted primordial germ cell (PGC) development, especially in female offspring, thus reducing fertility. UsingOct4-EGFPtransgenic mice with intrauterine hyperglycemia exposure, we revealed that hyperglycemia compromised sexually specific chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation reprogramming during PGC development. Particularly, in female PGCs, hyperglycemia leads to the aberrant retention of chromatin accessibility at pluripotency gene promoters such asNanogandTfap2c, inhibiting proper gene silencing and blocking the initiation of meiosis, which ultimately hinders oocyte maturation. Conversely, male PGCs exhibit less severe changes in chromatin accessibility and gene transcription. Intriguingly, the global DNA methylation reconstruction is impaired in male PGCs, particularly in key imprinted gene regions, suggesting potential developmental ramifications for later stages and even subsequent generations. Particularly, our findings indicate that intrauterine hyperglycemia adversely affects sex differentiation in PGCs by disrupting the expression of critical sex-determining transcription factors. Collectively, these findings highlight how intrauterine hyperglycemia interferes with sex-specific epigenetic reprogramming during PGC development, leading to abnormal germ cell development, reduced fertility, and adverse intergenerational effects.",

    "abstract": "The internal resistance of axons to ionic current flow determines action potential conduction velocity. Although mitochondria support axonal function, axons have been modeled as organelle-free cables, and mitochondrial impact on conduction velocity, specifically by increasing internal resistance, remains understudied. We combine computational modeling and electron microscopy of forebrain premotor axons controlling birdsong production. Modeling shows that when the propagating action potential in an unmyelinated axon encounters a mitochondrion, conduction velocity decreases, delaying the action potential by tenths of microseconds to microseconds, an effect that is stronger in small axons. Axonal mitochondria thereby induce conduction inhomogeneities, accumulating total delays of tenths of milliseconds to ~ a millisecond over 3 millimeters-long axons, in the range of the temporal precision of these neurons. Thus, by partially occupying the axoplasm, mitochondria constrain information processing in vertebrate small-diameter axons. Our model should permit future investigations on the impact of mitochondrial axonal plasticity on action potential temporal coding.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is a complex behavior regulated by various brain cell types. However, the roles of brain-resident macrophages, including microglia and CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs), particularly those derived postnatally, in sleep regulation remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of resident (embryo-derived) and repopulated (postnatally derived) brain-resident macrophages on the regulation of vigilance states in mice. We found that depletion in resident brain macrophages caused increased sleep in the active period, but reduced its quality, reflected in reduced power of brain sleep oscillations. This was observed both for the Non-REM and REM sleep stages. Subsequent repopulation by postnatal brain macrophages resulted in altered, but not fully restored, sleep-wake patterns and additionally induced sleep fragmentation. Furthermore, brain macrophage depletion caused excitatory-inhibitory synaptic imbalance, which was resistant to repopulation, and led to increased inhibitory synapses. At the metabolite level, the distinct metabolite profile induced by brain macrophage depletion largely returned to normal after repopulation. Our findings suggest a so far largely unknown interaction between brain-resident macrophages and sleep and highlight functional differences between resident and postnatally-derived repopulated brain macrophages, paving the way to future exploration of the role of brain macrophages of different origin in sleep disorders and synaptic connectivity.",

    "title": "Neddylation regulates the development and function of glutamatergic neurons",
    "abstract": "Neuronal development and function are orchestrated by a plethora of regulatory mechanisms that control the abundance, localization, interactions, and function of proteins. A key role in this regard is assumed by post-translational protein modifications (PTMs). While some PTM types, such as phosphorylation or ubiquitination, have been explored comprehensively, PTMs involving ubiquitin-like modifiers (Ubls) have remained comparably enigmatic (Ubls). This is particularly true for the Ubl Nedd8 and its conjugation to proteins, i.e. neddylation, in nerve cells. In the present study, we generated a conditional Nedd8 knock-out mouse line and examined the consequences of Nedd8-deletion in cultured post-mitotic glutamatergic neurons. Our findings reveal that Nedd8-ablation in young glutamatergic neurons causes alterations in the expression of developmental transcription factors that control neuronal differentiation, ultimately leading to defects in the development of a mature glutamatergic neuronal phenotype. Apparent manifestations of these defects include increased vGlut2 expression levels, reduced vGlut1 and endophilin1 expression levels, reduced dendrite complexity, and increased transmitter release probability. Collectively, our results highlight a pivotal role for neddylation in controlling the fate of glutamatergic neurons and excitatory synaptic transmission.",

    "abstract": "Primate lateral intraparietal area (LIP) has been directly linked to perceptual categorization and decision-making. However, the intrinsic LIP circuitry that gives rise to the flexible generation of motor responses to sensory instruction remains unclear. Using retrograde tracers, we delineate two distinct operational compartments based on different intrinsic connectivity patterns of dorsal and ventral LIP. These connections form an anatomical loop with a sensory-like, point-to-point projection from ventral to dorsal LIP and an asymmetric, widespread projection in reverse. In neurophysiological recordings, LIP neurons exhibit motor response fields spatially distinct from their sensory receptive field. Different associations of motor response and receptive fields in single neurons tile visual space. Ventral LIP neurons tend to have motor response fields distant from their sensory receptive fields. This circuit provides the neural substrate to generate the dynamic processes for flexible allocation of attention and motor responses in response to salient or instructive visual input across the visual field.",

    "title": "Chemoenzymatic cascade depolymerization of plastics",
    "abstract": "Plastic waste management is challenged by the inefficiencies and environmental impact of traditional chemical recycling methods. Here, the authors explore the chemoenzymatic cascade depolymerization approach, which offers a promising and sustainable solution for transforming plastic waste into valuable products. Since 1950, plastics have played a crucial role in modern society. Due to their numerous advantages, such as versatile physical material properties and low manufacturing costs, global plastic production reached roughly 400.3 million tons in 20221and is increasing yearly, with packaging (35%), consumer goods (23%), and construction (18%) applications accounting for the largest markets2. Despite its undeniable benefits, only 9% of single-use plastics are recycled, while 19% are incinerated, 50% end up in landfill and 22% evade waste management systems and go into either terrestrial or aquatic environments3. The massive accumulation of plastic waste in the ecosystems has posed serious threats to the various forms of life on earth. Therefore, an effective solution to tackle this crisis by transforming plastic waste into value-added products is immensely needed. Thermal depolymerization of plastics utilizes high temperatures, whereas chemical depolymerization employs a combination of temperature control and solvents in the presence/absence of catalysts. If no catalyst is used, the depolymerization is slow, and much higher temperatures and pressures are needed4. Chemical recycling has gained both academic and commercial interest in the recovery of valuable building blocks from plastic waste. Apart from chemical oxidation that converts plastic into structurally modified molecules5, it also includes various hydrolysis reactions, such as glycolysis, microwave pyrolysis/hydrolysis, acid hydrolysis, alcoholysis, aminolysis, and catalytic pyrolysis, in which hydrolysable plastic is broken down into small oligomers or monomers6. The traditional chemical approaches have been considered energy-intensive and solvent-sensitive, especially to afford complete depolymerization and are projected to be able to recycle only ca 17% of all end-of-life plastics by 20607. Another issue is selectivity, as often a “soup” of mixed products is observed that are difficult to separate. In contrast, enzymatic approaches have emerged as an alternative to chemical counterparts, which offers numerous advantages such as selectivity under milder reaction conditions, reduced energy consumption, minimal environmental impact, and inherent sustainability8. Biocatalytic depolymerization has achieved significant advancements in the biodegradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and more recently, polyurethane (PU)9and polyamide (PA)10. Research efforts to enable depolymerization of polystyrene (PS), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are ongoing, although the biotransformations mainly rely on free-radical mechanisms that can compromise selectivity otherwise offered by an enzyme active site11. In particular, enzymatic depolymerization and recycling of PET into its monomers, including MHET (mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid), TPA (terephthalic acid), have received much attention. Different enzymes (e.g., PETase, cutinases, esterases, lipases) have been reported to exhibit impressive degradation activity against various real-life PET materials (e.g., powders/granules, bottles, films, bags), even achieving nearly complete depolymerization at industrially relevant substrate loadings12,13,14,15. Yet, the efficiency of depolymerization heavily relies on the polymer’s properties, such as chemical structures, molecular weights, and the degree of crystallinity, in addition to the enzyme’s inherent activity to the particular chemical bond. For example, the FAST-PETase, a well-known variant engineered by machine learning, showed a quite low enzymatic depolymerization rate when commercial semi-crystalline PET bottles (degree of crystallinity ≥30%) were used as substrates, releasing only trace amounts of monomers (0.09 to 0.14 mM)15. Therefore, a more efficient method is required for plastic depolymerization. Is it possible to combine chemical and enzymatic processes by chemoenzymatic cascade reactions (Fig.1)? As a matter of fact, chemoenzymatic synthesis has been used as a multi-functional and highly sustainable synthetic tool to manufacture high-value-added organic molecules16,17,18. Likewise, there is a tremendous potential to use chemistry as a pre-treatment step to enhance material accessibility and bioactivity in enzymatic plastics deconstruction19. Herein, the role of the enzymes mainly is to assist in selectively when upgrading lower molecular weight molecules resulting from such chemical pretreatment11, such as by hydrolysis of more exposed bonds confined within the material. The final products can then be further used as feedstocks to produce new materials through chemical synthesis or implemented in metabolic engineering, achieving a circular plastics economy20,21.Fig. 1: Schematic illustrations of the chemoenzymatic cascade depolymerization of plastic.For the chemical part, the plastic polymers will undergo a series of pretreatments such as hydrolysis or oxidation, producing structurally modified polymers or lowMwoligomers/monomers; for the enzymatic part, these intermediates will be further converted (e.g., hydrolyzed) into final monomers or added-value molecules in a higher yield compared to that of single enzymatic depolymerization, which might not even be working for some types of plastic (dotted line). Overall, the chemoenzymatic cascade process can accelerate plastic depolymerization, offering a more sustainable approach for plastic waste management.Full size imageBornscheuer et al. disclosed a chemoenzymatic concept for the depolymerization of low molecular weight PE22. The polymer was chemically pretreated withm-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA) and ultrasonication under relatively mild temperatures (≤100 °C), followed by a four-enzyme cascade reaction, eventually leading to a ~27% polymer conversion (Fig.2). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) confirmed the significant reduction of particle size, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) found the formation of small-molecule products including ω-hydroxycarboxylic acids and α, ω-carboxylic acids after this cascade treatment. The cleavage ofsp3C-C bonds in PE is challenging. Purely chemical depolymerization, such as noncatalytic pyrolysis and gasification, requires high-temperatures input (≥500 °C), and these processes yield uncontrolled distribution of products23. Incorporating versatile catalysts into the chemical depolymerization of PE does contribute to increasing the reaction efficiency at around 200–300 °C24,25. While efficient, a mild, simple, green, and sustainable strategy is needed for recycling of PE waste. Clearly, the work by Bornscheuer et al. represents an important step forward in the depolymerization of PE based on chemistry coupled with a biological method. However, further improvements are needed asmCPBA is toxic; accordingly, an alternative chemical or pretreatment route could be employed to achieve the same effects in a safer manner. The complex procedure observed and the necessity of four enzymes potentially increase the cost, time, scope, and quality if applied in industry. Moreover, it would be important to perform the Life Cycle Assessment to evaluate the environmental impacts of the entire process.Fig. 2: Schemes of chemoenzymatic cascade depolymerization of low-molecular-weight polyethylene.Reproduced with permission22. Copyright 2024, WILEY.Full size imageFor PU recycling, glycolysis is one of the promising routes, as it gives a highly pure polyol moiety and under mild reaction conditions. Recent examples include deamination resulting in polyols recovered from the PU glycolysis26and a glycolysis process of PU waste by Riccardo et al.27. In comparison, a two-step chemoenzymatic recycling procedure for PU was reported recently, which consisted of pretreatment by glycolysis followed by enzymatic hydrolysis28. Chemical glycolysis of polyether-PU foam resulted in the formation of low molecular weight dicarbamates. Subsequently, recently discovered urethanases identified from metagenomic analysis hydrolyzed these intermediates into the final monomer toluene-2,4-diamine (TDA) (Fig.3). This work stands out as a new breakthrough in the depolymerization of polyether-based PU since the enzymatic hydrolysis of polyester-based PU that has been frequently reported in the previous studies rely on hydrolysis of ester bonds29,30. However, challenges remain in the combination of glycolysis and enzymatic degradation. It is essential to select a suitable catalyst to perform the glycolysis, which not only affects the hydrolysis efficiency but also possibly inactivates enzymes later in the process. More steps such as neutralization and separation are likely involved to ensure the compatibility between the complex chemical reaction system and the enzymatic process.Fig. 3: Schemes of chemoenzymatic recycling of TDI-based polyether-polyurethane foam.PU foam (A) as substrate and tin (II)-2-ethylhexanoate as catalyst (B) to generate intermediate products (C) subsequently converted by metagenomic urethanase (D) used by Bornscheuer et al. to yield final aromatic diamine (TDA).

Copyright 2023, WILEY.Full size imageRecent years have seen tremendous progress in the chemoenzymatic cascade valorization of PET31,32, polyamide (PA)33, PS34, and PET/polylactic acid (PLA) blends35. Among these, glycolysis is generally used as a chemical pretreatment of plastic in this two-step depolymerization. The reasons could be the high efficiency, relatively mild conditions compared to many pyrolysis methods (e.g., relatively low temperature of 200 °C) and flexible choice of various catalysts. Working with highly active enzymes, this chemo-bioprocess has been suggested to be potentially applicable to the recycling and upcycling of large-scale plastic waste. However, it would be desirable to use a noncatalytic, efficient, and more environmentally friendly method to pretreat these plastics before deploying a bio-depolymerization.In our recent study, microwave-assisted hydrolysis (polymer in water at 200 °C for 1–2 h), followed by PETase/S238A biodegradation, has shown high potential in PET depolymerization36. It was found that the microwave pretreatment resulted in the polymer chain’s conformation transitioning fromgauchetotransusing solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) whereas in silico simulations and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to confirmtransselectivity of S238A PETase. At this point, thetrans-selective variant S238A exhibited higher degradation activity compared to the wild-type enzyme, in particular for commercial water bottles (Fig.4). Our study highlighted the importance of conformational selection in biocatalytic plastic hydrolysis. It also demonstrated that microwave pretreatment (here hydrolysis instead of pyrolysis) could modify the properties of the polymer (e.g., chain conformation, molecular weight, and crystallinity) and make it more susceptible to enzymatic degradation. In principle, this combination of microwave pretreatment and enzymatic depolymerization can be extended to other polymer plastics, further accelerating enzymatic cascade depolymerization.Fig. 4: Schematic illustrations of conformational selection in PETase and S238A.aDistribution of conformations (transvsgauche) for untreated and by microwave pretreated PET confirmed by solid-state NMR (b) and responding enhanced enzymatic degradation activity by matching enzyme and substrate conformations.cScheme of conformational selection. A and B is adapted from our previous work36(CC BY 4.0).Full size image These wide ranges of successful examples have shown how enzymatic processes potentially enhance the efficiency, sustainability and applicability of chemical depolymerization for producing various valuable products. Thus, chemoenzymatic cascade depolymerization has already offered a proof-of-concept pipeline for the recycling and upcycling of plastics. However, several challenges remain. First, besides mechanical grinding to generate particles with increased surface area, there is no general formula of chemical pretreatment on various plastic polymers. In fact, different methods, such as microwave pre-treatment introduced by us for biocatalytic plastic recycling, may bring about diverse effects or even unwanted or no actions on these macromolecules (i.e., not all molecules absorb microwave radiation). Second, for non-hydrolysable petro-polymers (PE, PP, PS and PVC) with carbon chain backbones, enzyme activities remain largely unknown. Third, the enzyme’s activity or stability can be lower than expected, due to the release of byproducts from chemical processes or additives, and the complex reaction systems (e.g., the need for various chemical catalysts in the reaction mixture, metal ions, organic solvents, extreme pH conditions, high temperatures and pressures). The often stringent requirement of controllable conditions (e.g., temperature, pH, substrate concentration) for high enzyme activity can be described as reaction incompatibility. Fourth, a green, sustainable, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly pipeline of these two-step or one-pot chemoenzymatic cascade depolymerizations remains to be demonstrated. There is often a trade-off between reaction efficiency and environmental concerns as well as economic feasibility. Fifth, the recycling of plastics into final monomers is highly desired but faces challenges such as low yield and low purity, especially when blended plastic waste is used, causing high separation costs, hindering large-scale industrial applications. In the coming future, many efforts will focus on process optimizations and innovations to enable viable chemical cascade depolymerization of plastics. Integration of chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques such as high-resolution liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) will facilitate the identification of all intermediates and reaction species involved that affect biocatalyst performance in situ (e.g., various antioxidants, UV absorbers, light stabilizers and plasticizers). Moreover, a multi-enzyme cascade reaction could further increase the decomposition rate of the intermediates produced from the initial and intertwined chemical processes and allow the realization of much more complex product synthetic schemes37. A key priority will be the development of novel and tailor-made biocatalysts showing new-to-nature activities by de novo protein design38,39,40,41. Here the intrinsic stability often shown by de novo designed enzymes in concert with their unprecedented activities makes them highly suitable to be applied in chemoenzymatic cascade depolymerization strategies of difficult-to-recycle polymers. In this way, addressing chemical reactions that are currently considered too energy-intensive and environmentally unfriendly could be realized. A prominent example would be the exceptionally tough and durable polyolefins, requiring strong oxidative chemistries leading to reactive oxygen species, e.g., hydroxyl radicals. Generation of binding domains that wrap around the plastic will help in the enzymatic depolymerization, by either changing the surface property of plastic or increasing the adhesion capability of catalytic domains of enzymes; much like cellulose binding domains in nature42. Metabolic engineering that requires few dedicated enzymes will open new pathways for converting rich carbon sources derived from chemical cascade depolymerization to valuable products, such as bioplastics and biosurfactants20,43. Perhaps led by these advancements, chemoenzymatic cascade depolymerization can contribute to mitigating plastic pollution and improving the circularity in the chemical and plastic industry beyond PET.

    "abstract": "Mangrove forests store significant amounts of blue carbon, mainly as soil organic matter. Insights into mangrove organic matter are limited, despite its importance for understanding blue carbon accumulation and vulnerability to global change. Here, we quantified soil organic matter preserved through chemical recalcitrance and association with the mineral phase, as key factors influencing blue carbon persistence. We found that the nature of the soil organic matter varied with mangrove geomorphic settings. Delta settings were dominated by presumably the most persistent soil organic matter associated with minerals, while open coast karstic settings contained mostly particulate soil organic matter, likely preserved due to low microbial activity. Across mangrove soil depths, there was little difference in soil organic matter pools. The soil organic matter pool across mangroves’ geomorphic settings exhibited greater variation than that observed across all terrestrial biomes. These findings underscore the need to tailor mangrove conservation and restoration to geomorphic settings.",

    "title": "One-year outcomes of faricimab versus aflibercept treatment for polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy: a comparative study",
    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo compare the effectiveness of intravitreal faricimab and aflibercept injections in patients with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV).MethodsThis retrospective study analysed 111 treatment-naïve eyes (111 patients) with PCV who received intravitreal injections of either faricimab (30 eyes) or aflibercept (81 eyes). All patients were treated with three initial monthly loading injections. Visual and anatomical outcomes were compared between the two treatment groups after 12 months.ResultsAfter 12 months of treatment, mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved significantly in both the faricimab-treated and aflibercept groups (P< 0.05), with no significant difference in the extent of improvement between the two groups. Similarly, no significant differences were found in the reduction of central retinal thickness or subfoveal choroidal thickness, nor in the proportion of eyes with dry macula after treatment. However, the faricimab group showed a significantly greater reduction in maximum pigment epithelial detachment (PED) thickness from baseline than the aflibercept group (48.2% vs. 38.7%;P= 0.015). A higher proportion of eyes in the faricimab group also showed a PED thickness reduction >50% (66.7% vs. 42.0%;P= 0.021). The rate of polypoidal lesion regression did not differ significantly between the groups (50.0% vs. 38.3%;P= 0.256).ConclusionIntravitreal faricimab injections resulted in visual and anatomical improvements comparable to aflibercept in patients with PCV over 12 months of treatment, including a similar rate of polyp regression. In addition, faricimab was more effective in reducing PED thickness.",

    "title": "Drugs linked to blepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction, and chalazion: a real-world, population-based pharmacovigilance analysis",
    "abstract": "BackgroundBlepharitis, meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), and chalazia are common disorders impacting quality of life. This population-based, pharmacovigilance study aims to identify systemic drugs disproportionately linked to these disorders.MethodsData from the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) were analysed (Q4 2003 to Q2 2024). Disproportionality analyses were conducted to identify drugs with ≥10 primary suspect reports for which cases of blepharitis, MGD, or chalazion were overreported, using reporting odds ratios (RORs).Results1923 blepharitis, 202 MGD, and 290 chalazion reports were identified. MGD was overreported for finasteride (ROR = 71.6, 95% CI = 37.9–135.3), while chalazion was overreported for bortezomib (ROR = 73.9, 95% CI = 51.4–106.2). All three conditions were overreported for dupilumab (blepharitis: ROR = 35.7, 95% CI = 22.8–55.9; MGD: ROR = 15.4, 95% CI = 7.3–32.5; chalazion: ROR = 12.6, 95% CI = 5.6–28.5). Safety signals, predominantly associated with blepharitis, were also identified for isotretinoin, docetaxel, panitumumab, cetuximab, tretinoin, alendronate, erlotinib, zoledronate, daxibotulinumtoxinA, and infliximab.ConclusionsThis pharmacovigilance study identified associations between several systemic medications with reports of blepharitis, MGD, and chalazion. MGD and chalazion were overreported for finasteride and bortezomib, respectively, whereas all three conditions were overreported for dupilumab. These findings highlight systemic medications as often overlooked contributors to localised eyelid inflammation. Nonetheless, these drugs are known to reduce morbidity and mortality across many diseases. Therefore, while risks may not necessarily outweigh benefits to warrant changes in prescribing practices, clinicians should remain vigilant for such side effects, particularly in patients at higher risk, and to consider prophylactic measures when appropriate, such as educating patients about eyelid hygiene and counselling them to promptly report symptoms.",

    "title": "Personalised genomic strategies improve diagnostic yield in inherited retinal dystrophies: a stepwise, patient-centred approach",
    "abstract": "BackgroundInherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are a genetically heterogeneous group of conditions, with approximately 40% of cases remaining unresolved after initial genetic testing. This study aimed to assess the impact of a personalised genomic approach integrating whole-exome sequencing (WES) reanalysis, whole-genome sequencing (WGS), customised gene panels and functional assays to improve diagnostic yield in unresolved cases.Subjects/MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed a cohort of 597 individuals with IRDs, including 525 probands and 72 affected relatives. Among the 221 genetically unresolved cases, a subset of 101 was selected for stepwise re-evaluation. This included WES reanalysis with updated virtual panels, WGS in selected cases and targeted sequencing of complex regions. Variant interpretation was refined using updated classification criteria, segregation analysis and functional assays such as mRNA and minigene/midigene studies.ResultsAn initial diagnostic yield of 59.6% (313/525) was achieved through first-tier genetic testing. Re-evaluation of the 101 prioritised cases resulted in 42 new diagnoses in probands and resolution of 7 more familial cases, yielding 49 additional diagnoses among previously unresolved patients (48.5%). This increased the overall diagnostic rate for probands to 67.6% (355/525). Functional assays confirmed pathogenicity of variants inABCA4,ATF6,REEP6,andTULP1, while WGS enabled the detection of structural and deep intronic variants, further enhancing diagnostic accuracy.ConclusionsA patient-centred, stepwise genomic approach significantly improved the molecular diagnosis of IRDs. This strategy supports the clinical utility of periodic WES reanalysis and targeted use of customised panels, WGS and functional assays. The proposed workflow is scalable and applicable to routine clinical practice, contributing to precision medicine in IRDs.",

    "abstract": "In coeliac disease (CeD), the epithelial lining (EL) of the small intestine is severely damaged by a complex auto-inflammatory response, leading intraepithelial lymphocytes to attack epithelial cells. To understand the intestinal changes and genetic regulation in CeD, we investigated the heterogeneity in the transcriptomic profile of the duodenal EL using RNA-seq and eQTL analysis on predicted cell types. The study included duodenal biopsies from 82 patients, grouped into controls, gluten-free diet treated CeD and untreated CeD. We identified 1 862 differential expressed genes, which clustered into four sets. Two sets, one upregulated for cell cycle function (n= 366) and one downregulated for digestion, transmembrane transport, and laminin pathways (n= 543), defined three sample groups based on inflammation status: non-inflamed, mild inflammation or severe inflammation. The remaining two sets of genes were enriched for immune (n= 458) and extracellular matrix and barrier functions (n= 495) and were sufficient to classify samples into their disease conditions. Finally, deconvoluting eQTL effects from epithelial and immune cells identified 6 and 15 cell-type-mediated eQTL genes, respectively. In sum, we identified genes expressed in the duodenal EL whose expression reflect heterogeneity in CeD and that may be used as biomarkers to assess CeD condition and its mucosal and immune status.",

    "abstract": "In a globalised trading environment, the role of logistics and ports is becoming increasingly important with the rapid development of international trade. This study makes a unique contribution to the field by addressing the issues of globalisation, logistics and ports (GLP) through bibliometric analysis. The originality of the research lies in its holistic approach to examining GLP issues through scientific mapping. In this respect, the study fills an important gap in the literature by addressing the issues of globalisation, logistics and ports, which have so far been studied separately, in an integrated framework and by highlighting the interactions between these fields. In this context, we searched the Scopus and WoS databases on 11 January 2025 using keywords related to GLP and obtained a dataset of 265 publications covering the period 1996–2025. The analysis shows that the GLP literature is growing and that academic interest in the field continues. It also shows that GLP is often discussed in relation to key economic agendas such as competitiveness, sustainability and efficiency. According to the Country Collaboration Network analysis, China, the United States of America and the United Kingdom are among the most prominent countries in GLP publications, showing that these countries have established a strong collaborative network both among themselves and with other countries. In terms of responsible authors, in addition to these three countries, Spain is also a prominent actor. This situation shows that researchers in these countries have a central and influential position in GLP studies. Moreover, the study systematically documents the links between key GLP issues and offers a comprehensive analysis of the literature. The findings are of strategic importance not only to the academic community but also to policy makers and industry stakeholders.",

    "title": "Comment on: Variations in diagnostic criteria for male hypogonadism: is there a need for standardizing specialist society guidelines?",
    "abstract": "The comprehensive review by Tsampoukas et al., outlines a concerning reality in contemporary andrology: the absence of consensus regarding the definition of testosterone deficiency (TD) and male hypogonadism diagnosis/management [1]. Their analysis of nine major guidelines reveals discrepancies that extend beyond mere threshold differences, potentially affecting clinical decision-making. These variations highlight the need to address these issues in the future. In this regard, the authors identified terminological inconsistencies ranging from “male hypogonadism” to “testosterone deficiency” to “functional hypogonadism”. As such, this linguistic heterogeneity reflects potential disagreements about the pathophysiological basis of the low testosterone. This reflects varying perspectives on the clinical syndrome. For instance, the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines emphasize a more comprehensive definition of testicular dysfunction, encompassing both androgenic and spermatogenic failure [2]. In contrast, the American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines focus mainly on symptomatic TD [2,3]. The introduction of “functional hypogonadism” by the European Academy of Andrology adds another layer of complexity, attempting to distinguish reversible suppression from irreversible organic etiology [4,5]. In this context, this classification system of hypogonadism lacks universal acceptance and clear management strategies.Perhaps most concerning is the variability in biochemical cutoffs for diagnosis. Total testosterone thresholds have been identified to range from 8 nmol/L (231 ng/dL) to 12 nmol/L (346 ng/dL); this inevitably creates a “gray zone” that affects a non-negligible proportion of men evaluated for TD [2,3,6]. This variation cannot be attributed solely to assay differences or population characteristics; rather, it reflects uncertainty about the total testosterone level below which symptoms of hypogonadism manifest. Insurance providers and regulatory agencies disagree on what lower limit to use to cover prescribed testosterone therapy, with some requiring levels below 300 ng/dL while others use 250 ng/dL as their threshold. The authors correctly highlight that while most societies converge on free testosterone cutoffs around 220–225 pmol/L, the role of free testosterone remains contentious. The heterogeneity is striking: the AUA guidelines make no mention of free testosterone measurements, while the Endocrine Society recommends free testosterone assessment when total testosterone is borderline [3,6]. The EAU and British Society for Sexual Medicine advocate for free testosterone measurement in cases where total testosterone falls between 8 and 12 nmol/L, particularly when SHBG abnormalities are suspected [2,7]. The International Society for Sexual Medicine similarly supports free testosterone evaluation for borderline cases, whereas the Italian societies (Società Italiana di Andrologia e Medicina della Sessualità and Società Italiana Endocrinologia) formally incorporate free testosterone into their diagnostic algorithm [8]. Notably, the Society for Endocrinology’s skepticism about free testosterone measurements contrasts with other societies on this parameter for borderline cases [9].",

Conservation efforts thus far have targeted habitat loss and degradation in the Yellow Sea region, with little attention having been given to direct mortality by humans. Here we studied the impacts of direct mortality of shorebirds along China’s coast during migration from hunting, fishery bycatch and, at aquaculture sites, bird deterrence measures. We estimated that approximately 47,870 shorebirds were killed at 19 stopover sites per year, mainly from hunting and deterrence. Mortalities for 11 shorebird species account for 1% to 10% of their known total flyway populations. Conservative annual direct mortality rates for four species exceeded sustainable levels, with nine other species approaching unsustainable levels. Direct mortality due to humans is clearly a major overlooked threat to migratory shorebird populations along the East Asian–Australasian Flyway. Reducing it is essential to conserving these declining species.",

Cytokine-transcriptional TFHprogramming demonstrated that type I interferon and TGFβ signaling direct individual TFHphenotypes to instruct B cell output. Cytokine-directed TFHtranscriptional phenotypes are shared within human germinal centers, but distinct TFHphenotypes dominate between donors and following immune challenge or in antibody-mediated disease. Finally, we identified new cell surface markers that align with distinct TFHphenotypes.

    "title": "Changing the narrative in suicide prevention",
    "abstract": "Despite progress, suicide remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Changing the narrative means moving beyond stigma and embracing a collective agenda across communities, health systems and policy to implement solutions and to prevent avoidable deaths. Earlier this year, the World Health Organization (WHO) released itsSuicide worldwide in 2021: global health estimatesreport. In 2021, an estimated 727,000 people died by suicide — an increase of 3.4% from 2019. Suicide remains the third leading cause of death among those 15–29 years of age, and 73% of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). It is a stark reminder of the broad reach of suicide: a global public health burden and a toll taken on families and communities. Suicidal behavior is both complex and multifactorial. It emerges from the interplay between social determinants — inequality, limited education, racial and ethnic disparities, restricted access to healthcare, and occupational pressures — and individual risk factors such as mental illness, childhood trauma, serious illness, legal problems, substance use, violence and abuse. Because these factors interact differently for individual people and across cultural and social contexts, suicide prevention requires nuanced, evidence-based interventions, the involvement of multiple stakeholders, and a commitment to capacity building, financing and ongoing evaluation. Initiatives such as the WHO’sLIVE LIFEincorporate this multisectoral approach paired with suicide-prevention strategies, such as limiting access to the means of suicide, responsible media coverage, socioemotional skill development and early risk identification. Despite the availability of guidance and frameworks for suicide prevention, organizing strategic action and increased advocacy are necessary. Each year, the International Association for Suicide Prevention organizesWorld Suicide Prevention Dayon 10 September to raise awareness and to improve understanding about suicide. This year’s campaign is ‘Change the Narrative’. It is a simple phrase designed to spur more honest and open discussion about the entrenched stigma associated with suicide and suicidal behavior and to underscore the idea that suicide can be prevented. In addition to the yellow and orange ribbon signifying suicide-prevention awareness, the campaign is using ‘#StartTheCoversation’ on social media to inspire people to speak out, to challenge barriers and to elevate support for people who are suffering. It is often believed that speaking about suicide to a person in crisis may worsen their state; instead, offering a non-judgmental and empathetic conversation about it can reduce risk and provide a crucial opportunity for intervention. In recognition of the need to amplify suicide-prevention awareness, the September 2025 issue ofNature Mental Healthfeatures several pieces focusing on different aspects of suicidality and suicide prevention and those who are most affected. In anArticleby Hyeon Kim and collaborators, updated estimates are presented for global suicide mortality from 1990 to 2021 and for projected future suicide rates until 2050. Using the WHO Mortality Database, the analysis points to a significant decline in mortality over the period examined and predicts a modest decrease in mortality up to 2050. Although these data support the idea of a global trend in decreased mortality from suicide, they fall short of the aim of the 2030 WHO Sustainable Development Goals to reduce suicide deaths by a third. The authors emphasize differences between LMICs and high-income countries (HICs): although the majority of suicide deaths occur in in LMICs, which contain a greater proportion of the world’s population, suicide mortality rates are higher in HICs. It is a pattern that reinforces the need to better understand social determinant drivers of suicide regionally and calls for tailored suicide-prevention strategies. APerspectiveby Daiane Borges Machado invites us to rethink suicide-prevention strategies by bringing insights derived from the global south. The piece discusses how strategies developed by LMICs with limited resources can also inform the suicide-prevention agendas in HICs — a shift in how implementation strategies developed by the global north are often applied in the global south context. Machado presents a thought-provoking argument that many global guidelines are rooted in high-quality evidence-based programs developed in HICs but may neglect knowledge of the global south or lack culturally informed strategies that support economic improvement or community empowerment. Machado advocates for epistemological decolonization through the involvement of local stakeholders to develop and deliver co-designed interventions that are culturally appropriate. Co-designed research is a powerful way to incorporate otherwise overlooked or underutilized sources of expertise. An example of co-designed research can be found in aCommentby Eve Griffin and coauthors describing the partnership between the Irish charity HUGG, which provides support to people bereaved by suicide, and a research team from the National Suicide Research Foundation. Their collaboration resulted in the design and conducting of the AfterWords Survey, which collected data on a national level to understand the needs of and experiences lived by people bereaved by suicide. Suicide bereavement profoundly impacts mental and physical health, with those affected facing a higher risk of suicide themselves. The authors argue that supporting ‘postvention’ research should be included as part of the suicide-prevention agenda, including funding for ‘postvention’ services and new research initiatives. AnotherCommentin the issue by Jo Robinson and colleagues discusses how co-production should be included in the development of suicide-prevention programs for young people in schools. Suicide is the third leading cause of death among young people globally, especially among LGBT+ youth, and suicide-related thoughts and behaviors are on the rise. The authors emphasize the school setting as a rich environment for such programs, but also point to the challenges of implementing school-based programs where there are limited resources. They advocate for better integration of health and education departments for joint efforts in reducing suicide in young people through the implementation of evidence-based programs in schools. Suicide risk, however, extends beyond school settings. Occupational settings can impart enhanced risk as well, including the medical, agriculture and construction industries. ACorrespondenceby Olivia Remes unpacks the ‘silent crisis’ in the construction industry, which faces alarmingly high rates of suicide among male workers. The authors conducted a survey of over 2,000 construction professionals, revealing that 26% had suicidal thoughts and 91% felt overwhelmed within a year, citing stressors such as poor communication, unrealistic deadlines, and unsafe and inadequate facilities. The piece emphasizes the need for cultural shifts, safer workplace environments, and further research to effectively address the mental health challenges of one of the largest occupational sectors. This month’s issue also presents aQ&Awith Lakshmi Vijayakumar, a psychiatrist, academic and founder of SNEHA, a non-governmental organization in Chennai, India, that works as a helpline for suicide prevention. In an inspiring conversation, she shares how she transformed personal encounters with tragedy into research and nation-level policy reform. This piece also includes her emphasis on the notion that suicide is not only about mental health but also about social factors, making suicide prevention a collective work. A common denominator to each of the pieces featured in the September issue is that suicide prevention is most effective when it is collaborative and culturally informed and works to address mental health and the social determinants of mental health and wellbeing. Changing the narrative in suicide prevention also means changing who is involved in the conversation. Whether through global strategies, community-led initiatives and interventions, or co-designed research, success depends on bringing stakeholders together to create suicide-prevention solutions that are relevant, inclusive and grounded in real-world experiences.

    "title": "Common genetic variants modify disease risk and clinical presentation in monogenic diabetes",
    "abstract": "Young-onset monogenic disorders often show variable penetrance, yet the underlying causes remain poorly understood. Uncovering these influences could reveal new biological mechanisms and enhance risk prediction for monogenic diseases. Here we show that polygenic background substantially shapes the clinical presentation of maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), a common monogenic form of diabetes that typically presents in adolescence or early adulthood. We find strong enrichment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) polygenic risk, but not type 1 diabetes risk, in genetically confirmed MODY cases (n= 1,462). This T2D polygenic burden, primarily through beta-cell dysfunction pathways, is strongly associated with earlier age of diagnosis and increased diabetes severity. Common genetic variants collectively account for 24% (P< 0.0001) of the phenotypic variability. Using a large population cohort (n= 424,553), we demonstrate that T2D polygenic burden substantially modifies diabetes onset in individuals with pathogenic variants, with diabetes risk ranging from 11% to 81%. Finally, we show that individuals with MODY-like phenotypes (n= 300) without a causal variant have elevated polygenic burden for T2D and related traits, representing potential polygenic phenocopies. These findings reveal substantial influence of common genetic variation in shaping the clinical presentation of early-onset monogenic disorders. Incorporating these may improve risk estimates for individuals carrying pathogenic variants.",

    "abstract": "The essential cofactor coenzyme A (CoASH) and its thioester derivatives (acyl-CoAs) have pivotal roles in cellular metabolism. However, the mechanism by which different acyl-CoAs are accurately partitioned into different subcellular compartments to support site-specific reactions, and the physiological impact of such compartmentalization, remain poorly understood. Here, we report an optimized liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-based pan-chain acyl-CoA extraction and profiling method that enables a robust detection of 33 cellular and 23 mitochondrial acyl-CoAs from cultured human cells. We reveal that SLC25A16 and SLC25A42 are critical for mitochondrial import of free CoASH. This CoASH import process supports an enriched mitochondrial CoA pool and CoA-dependent pathways in the matrix, including the high-flux TCA cycle and fatty acid oxidation. Despite a small fraction of the mitochondria-localized CoA synthase COASY, de novo CoA biosynthesis is primarily cytosolic and supports cytosolic lipid anabolism. This mitochondrial acyl-CoA compartmentalization enables a spatial regulation of anabolic and energy-related catabolic processes, which promises to shed light on pathophysiology in the inborn errors of CoA metabolism.",

While protected areas may help buffer against the impact of aridification, their effectiveness in mitigating the aridity thresholds across global drylands remains virtually unknown. Here we assembled a global dataset of drylands and found that highly protected areas, which include national parks and wilderness areas, can buffer the emergence of aridity thresholds in ecosystem productivity by up to 0.15 units of aridity. This suggests that, in highly protected regions, drylands must become substantially drier before reaching an aridity-induced threshold in ecosystem productivity. The importance of highly protected area for supporting drylands was consistent across 23 years of study, in woody and non-woody ecosystems and after accounting for rangelands. Notably, only 3.3% of all drylands were under The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) category I high levels of protection such as wilderness areas, with 3.8% being protected under IUCN category II (for example, national parks). Overall, our findings highlight the crucial role of highly protected areas in maintaining productive dryland ecosystem in the face of global aridity thresholds, and further stress the need for increasing the level of protection to ensure the conservation of drylands under predicted climate changes.",

    "title": "Purifying recombinant proteins fromNicotiana benthamianafor structural studies",
    "abstract": "Structural biology is fundamental to understanding the molecular basis of biological processes. While machine learning-based protein structure prediction has advanced considerably, experimentally determined structures remain indispensable for guiding structure–function analyses and for improving predictive modeling. However, experimental studies of protein complexes continue to pose challenges, particularly due to the necessity of high protein concentrations and purity for downstream analyses such as cryogenic electron microscopy. Transient transformation ofNicotiana benthamianahas emerged as a promising expression system for recombinant protein production, offering advantages such as low operating costs, rapid cultivation, short experimental turnaround and scalability compared with other established platforms such as insect or human cell culture systems. Here we present a versatile protocol leveragingN. benthamianafor the purification and structural analysis of protein complexes of diverse origin and composition, exemplified by six oligomeric complexes ranging from ~140 to ~660 kDa, originating from plant, vertebrate, fungal and bacterial species. In most cases, purification only requires a single epitope tag, simplifying workflows and reducing complications that come with multitag and sequential affinity purifications. The protocol enables rapid application, allowing protein sample production in fewer than 7 days. Critical parameters influencing expression and purification efficiency include codon alteration, epitope tag selection and detergent supplementation.",

    "title": "m6A and the NEXT complex direct Xist RNA turnover and X-inactivation dynamics",
    "abstract": "X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in mammals is orchestrated by the noncoding RNA X-inactive-specific transcript (Xist) that, together with specific interacting proteins, functions incisto silence an entire X chromosome. Defined sites on Xist RNA carry theN6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification and perturbation of the m6A writer complex has been found to abrogate Xist-mediated gene silencing. However, the relative contribution of m6A and its mechanism of action remain unclear. Here we investigate the role of m6A in XCI by applying rapid degron-mediated depletion of METTL3, the catalytic subunit of the m6A writer complex, an approach that minimizes indirect effects because of transcriptome-wide depletion of m6A. We find that acute loss of METTL3 and m6A accelerates Xist-mediated gene silencing and this correlates with increased levels and stability of Xist transcripts. We show that Xist RNA turnover is mediated by the nuclear exosome targeting complex but is independent of the principal nuclear m6A reader protein YTHDC1. Our findings demonstrate that the primary function of m6A on Xist RNA is to promote Xist RNA turnover, which in turn regulates XCI dynamics.",

    "title": "Scalable catalytic nanofiltration membranes for advanced water treatment",
    "abstract": "Commercial nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes are inherently inefficient at removing small, neutral organic contaminants. In this study, we biomimetically designed a catalytic nanofiltration membrane that synergizes advanced oxidation with nanofiltration to achieve near-complete removal of contaminants, ranging from salts to small organic contaminants, addressing a key deficiency of nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes and marking a breakthrough in membrane technology. The developed catalytic nanofiltration membrane amplifies the rate of peroxymonosulfate activation reactions by enriching its concentration near the membrane surface by a factor of 6.9 through concentration polarization. Confinement of the catalyst within the nanometre-scale pores greatly enhances the reactivity of the catalyst. Furthermore, the small pore size (<1.2 nm) effectively rejects natural organic matter (NOM) and the salts formed during the catalytic processes, thereby minimizing the interference of NOM within the active layer and preventing secondary contamination from salts, minimizing their interference in oxidative contaminant transformation. The optimized catalytic nanofiltration membrane demonstrated exceptional contaminant removal efficiency, maintaining close to 100% efficiency over 500 hours of continuous cross-flow filtration, and its fabrication was scaled up to the industrial scale through a roll-to-roll process, highlighting its practical viability for real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Background:Children hospitalized for surgery face malnutrition risks. This study assessed nutritional risk and status in hospitalized neonatal surgical patients using a modified Screening Tool for the Assessment of Malnutrition in Pediatrics (STAMP) combined with anthropometry.Methods:A retrospective analysis of neonatal surgical patients from December 2020 to October 2024 was conducted at a children’s hospital, utilizing the modified STAMP and anthropometric measurements.Results:Among 2700 patients, 1712 were male (63.41%) and 988 female (36.59%). Risk classification showed 33.48% low risk, 30.22% medium risk, and 36.30% high risk, with males more frequently at medium to high risk (P< 0.001). Superficial tumors were common in low-risk patients, while gastrointestinal diseases predominated in higher-risk groups. Malnutrition was diagnosed in 27.04% of patients, with acute malnutrition more prevalent than chronic. Neonates (36.74%) exhibited higher malnutrition risk (P< 0.001). High-risk patients had lower height, weight, and biochemical levels (albumin, retinol-binding protein, prealbumin) (P< 0.001) and incurred longer hospital stays. Male sex, younger age, and formula feeding were identified as risk factors for increased malnutrition risk.Conclusion:This study provides new data on the application of the modified STAMP score combined with Z-scores in infants and neonates with surgical conditions.ImpactThis study offers new data and theoretical insights into the application of the modified STAMP scoring system in infants and even neonates with surgical conditions.This study demonstrates the applicability of the modified STAMP scoring system in infants and neonates, providing a theoretical foundation for the future development of neonatal nutritional risk screening tools and preoperative prehabilitation strategies for infants undergoing surgery.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFetal growth restriction (FGR) causes an adaptive redistribution of the cardiac output towards sustained cerebral vasodilation. However, the consequences of FGR and cerebral vasodilatation due to fetal hypoxia on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are still poorly studied. This study assesses BBB permeability in the neonatal cortex of pups gestated under intrauterine hypobaric hypoxia.Methods15 Guinea pig(Cavia porcellus)newborns were used in this study; 8 were gestated in normoxia (Nx), and 7 were gestated under chronic hypobaric hypoxia (Hx). Fetal examinations by ultrasound were assessed. At birth, pups were euthanized, and the cerebral cortex was collected to determine gene and protein expression. The permeability was quantified by immunolocalization of perivascular albumin in the prefrontal cortex BBB.ResultThe brain-sparing phenotype was associated with increased medial cerebral artery vasodilation during gestation and carotid endothelial vasodilation at birth. Additionally, gestational hypoxia decreased the protein levels of claudin-5 and claudin-12 in the neonatal cortex. Finally, albumin-immunopositive areas significantly increased in the brain parenchyma in the Hx neonatal cortex.ConclusionOur findings demonstrate that gestational hypoxia is associated with changes in the expression of genes and proteins related to the paracellular permeability of the BBB, which appears relevant to normal neurodevelopmental processes in perinatal life.ImpactGestational hypoxia generated a redistribution of flow (brain-sparing effects) associated with an increase in the cerebroplacental index and a growth restriction at birth using guinea pigs as an FGR model.The brain-sparing phenotype is associated with a decrease in the expression of claudins in the cerebral vasculature and increased BBB permeability in newborns gestated in hypobaric hypoxia.The observed permeability of the BBB in the neonatal cortex resembles the permeability phenotypes of postnatal hypoxia models, such as those of cerebral infarction or neonatal ischemic encephalopathy.",

    "title": "Re: Evaluating PI-RADS lesions and clinically significant prostate cancer in Black and Asian men: a PREVENT randomized clinical trial secondary analysis",
    "abstract": "The recent secondary analysis of the PREVENT trial examining PI-RADS performance across racial groups raises necessary concerns about equity in prostate cancer diagnostics. The finding that Black men with PI-RADS 3/4 lesions had significantly higher odds of clinically significant prostate cancer, and that Asian men with PI-RADS 3 lesions had no cancers detected, deserves careful interpretation. While these results appear to highlight racial differences in diagnostic yield, we caution against reading them as evidence of innate biological differences.As has been powerfully argued by Boyd et al. [1] in The New England Journal of Medicine, using race as a biological variable in clinical algorithms perpetuates the false notion of inherent racial difference and risks embedding racism into medical practice [1]. The discrepancies observed in this study are more plausibly the result of how PI-RADS was developed—based primarily on data from White men—than of meaningful biological variation between racial groups [2].Moreover, a systematic review by Roberts et al. [3] underscores how often race is used in genetic research as a stand-in for ancestry without adequate justification, leading to flawed conclusions and reinforcing stereotypes [3]. The PREVENT analysis does not use genetic ancestry data, and thus cannot establish whether differences in outcomes are due to biological or structural factors.Algorithms that do not account for diverse populations can misclassify or misdiagnose, worsening disparities. As Chen et al. [4] emphasize, models trained on racially homogenous data often underperform in underrepresented groups, calling for more inclusive and representative research design [4]. The PREVENT findings support this call, highlighting the urgent need to recalibrate tools like PI-RADS based on broader, ancestry-informed datasets.This study is a valuable contribution, not because it proves racial differences in disease biology, but because it exposes the limitations of one-size-fits-all diagnostics in a racially diverse world. Moving forward, we must develop diagnostic standards that reflect the populations we aim to serve—grounded in inclusion, not assumptions. Boyd RW, Lindo EG, Weeks LD, McLemore MR.

    "abstract": "Human communication is remarkable for its flexibility, a trait largely reflected in its multimodal nature and shared to some extent with nonhuman primates. Although individual differences in social behaviour are known to have evolutionary implications, their role in shaping primate communication remains largely unexplored. This study adopts a multimodal framework to partition variation in chimpanzees’ use of multicomponent and multisensory communicative strategies into socio-environmental, between-individual, and within-individual sources. Results showed that research setting and signaller’s sex affected communicative expression. Importantly, we also detected consistent between-individual differences in both strategies, independent of age, sex, or setting. While only multicomponent signal use was predicted by behavioural context at the population level, individuals varied in how they adjusted to context only in their use of multisensory acts. These findings reveal substantial flexibility in chimpanzee communication, highlighting individual-specific patterns and supporting a gradual evolutionary pathway toward the complexity of human multimodal communication.",

    "abstract": "During early pregnancy in mice, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) regulates embryo implantation by activating the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway. The STAT3 pathway has been recognized to play a critical role in embryo implantation; however, it remains unclear whether STAT3 activation alone is sufficient to induce implantation. In this study, we investigated the effects of RO8191, a potential STAT3 activator, on embryo implantation through a series of studies with different mouse models. We found that RO8191 can induce embryo implantation and decidual reaction by activating STAT3, but not STAT1, signaling in both epithelial and stromal compartments in delayed implantation models. Furthermore, RO8191 was able to rescue implantation and establish pregnancy even in uterine epithelial-specificLifrconditional knockout (cKO) mice, which exhibit infertility due to implantation failure. In contrast, in uterine epithelial-specificStat3orGp130conditional knockout (cKO) mice, which also show embryo implantation failure, RO8191 induces only a partial decidual response. These results suggest that STAT3, Gp130 and LIFR each play distinct roles in embryo implantation and development. Although the detailed mechanisms underlying RO8191’s action remain to be elucidated, our findings provide insights supporting its potential application in treating recurrent implantation failure.",

    "abstract": "The increasing prevalence of depression has highlighted Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) as an effective treatment. However, conventional MBCT has several limitations, including barriers to access, the need for trained professionals, and inconsistent levels of participant engagement. The feasibility of using Virtual Reality (VR) for MBCT has emerged as a promising solution, but further research is needed to assess its therapeutic potential. This study examines the potential of VR-based treatment as an approach for individuals with depression. We developed and evaluated introductory mindfulness exercises and a three-session VR-MBCT program and conducted a feasibility study. Using the Meta Quest Pro and the E4 wristband, we collected data from 73 participants and analyzed feasibility, engagement, and behavioral patterns. Results showed high concentration levels, distinct emotional responses, and unique interaction patterns in individuals with depression. While survey data showed no significant differences between individuals with depression and individuals without depression in terms of the usability and presence of VR, sensor data showed higher entropy in electrodermal activity for individuals with depression, suggesting better emotional confrontation. Overall, our study highlighted the user-friendly and immersive aspects of VR-MBCT and its feasibility and potential applicability for individuals with depression.",

    "title": "A prediction nomogram for mild cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes mellitus based on the Chinese visceral adiposity index",
    "abstract": "Visceral adiposity has been proposed to be closely linked to cognitive impairment. This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of Chinese Visceral Adiposity Index (CVAI) for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to develop a quantitative risk assessment model. A total of 337 hospitalized patients with T2DM were included and randomly assigned to a training cohort (70%,n= 236) and a validation cohort (30%,n= 101). Demographic, clinical, and neuropsychological data were collected. CVAI levels were compared between patients with MCI and those with normal cognition. Associations between CVAI and cognitive performance were assessed using Spearman correlation and multivariable linear regression. Predictors of MCI were identified through Lasso regression followed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. A nomogram incorporating age, gender, education level, and CVAI was constructed and validated using calibration plots, ROC curve analysis, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Patients with MCI exhibited significantly higher CVAI values and lower MoCA and MMSE scores compared to those with normal cognition (allP< 0.001). CVAI was independently and negatively associated with MoCA and MMSE scores (β = -0.22,P< 0.001 for both) after adjustment. Multivariate logistic regression confirmed CVAI as an independent risk factor for MCI (P= 0.002). The nomogram demonstrated good discrimination, with an AUC of 0.765 in the training cohort and 0.690 in the validation cohort, and exhibited favorable clinical utility based on DCA. These findings suggest that CVAI is a valuable biomarker for the early identification and risk stratification of MCI in T2DM, and that the CVAI-based nomogram provides a practical tool for individualized clinical decision-making.",

    "title": "Liver steatosis mediates the association between metabolic score for insulin resistance and obstructive sleep apnea",
    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and liver fat accumulation. However, the specific mediating role of liver-related metabolic indicators in this association has not been fully studied. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between Metabolic Score for Insulin Resistance (METS-IR) and OSA, focusing on the mediating effects of liver fat percentage (PLF) and hepatic steatosis index (HSI). Understanding these mechanisms may provide insights into targeted interventions for OSA. A total of 12,655 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were included in this analysis. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) was assessed using the NHANES questionnaire. Weighted multivariate logistic regression was employed to assess the relationship between METS-IR and OSA, with a mediation model constructed to explore the mediating roles of key liver and metabolic markers, including PLF, HSI, SII and OBS. Among 12,655 subjects, 31.04% had OSA. METS-IR was closely related to the increased risk of OSA, and the highest quartile group of METS-IR had a significantly increased risk of OSA (OR = 2.36, 95% CI 1.73–3.23). Mediating effect analysis showed that PLF and HSI mediated 6.95% and 17.87% of the effects, respectively, while systemic immunity-inflammation index (SII) and oxidative balance score (OBS) had no significant mediating effect. METS-IR is an important predictor of OSA risk, primarily mediated by hepatic lipid accumulation. Addressing insulin resistance and hepatic metabolic health is crucial for the effective management of OSA and provides valuable guidance for clinical risk assessment in susceptible populations.",

    "title": "Integrated acoustic identification of a petit-spot volcanic field in the oldest Pacific plate",
    "abstract": "Petit-spot volcanism plays a critical role in the metasomatism of oceanic plates prior to subduction and in their recycling into the deep mantle. The extent of metasomatism depends on the number and volume of petit-spot volcanic edifices and intrusions, making precise identification of petit-spot volcanic fields essential. However, conventional methods based on seafloor topography and acoustic backscatter intensity alone have limitations in accurately delineating these features. Here we compiled acoustic survey data obtained using subbottom profilers mounted on both research vessels and submersibles in the region southeast of Minamitorishima (Marcus) Island, the oldest part of the Pacific plate. Analysis of the subbottom profiler data revealed three main stratigraphic facies: O-type (opaque), T-type (transparent), and L-type (layered). Among these types, OL-type facies, characterized by low slope gradients and high backscatter intensity, indicate petit-spot lava flows. Additionally, M-type facies, marked by multiple discontinuous reflections, occur at boundaries between OL-type and other facies, representing transitional zones formed by intrusive activity. High-resolution acoustic stratigraphy and ground-truth observations from submersible dives confirmed that M-type facies reflect petit-spot lava intrusions. Integrating seafloor backscatter with subseafloor stratigraphy provides a robust and reliable method for delineating petit-spot volcanism and assessing its geological impact on the abyssal seafloor.",

    "abstract": "In November 2024, there was an unusual surge in human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection cases in Beijing. We performed an epidemiological investigation among cases with acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI). We enrolled ARTI cases from 35 sentinel hospitals, collected samples and medical records, conducted comprehensive pathogen testing, sequenced target genes or whole genomes, and performed phylogenetic analysis. A total of 79,793 cases were included in this study from 2014 to 2024. The hMPV epidemic exhibited typical seasonality from December to April of the following year, with an overall positivity rate of hMPV of 1.6%. The positivity rate of hMPV was highest in the 0–4 year age group (3.4%) and remained relatively high (1.2%) among populations over 60 years of age. Genotypes A and B were cocirculated, with predominant genotypes alternating every two years. We identified two variants of A2c with 180 or 111 nucleotide duplications in the G gene since 2016, and the A2c111nt-duphas been predominant (56.9%) over the parent A2c since 2018. HMPV infection experienced an unusual surge beginning in November 2024 and peaked in December (9.5%). Subgenotype B2 (98.3%) returned to the predominant position instead of the A2c111nt-dupand seemed to be associated with milder illness. Twenty hMPV isolates collected in 2024 were identified as known subgenotypes (A2c and B2) via whole-genome analyses. In conclusion, hMPV exhibited a typical seasonality in Beijing, with the predominant genotypes alternating every two years. Its unusual surge in November 2024 was attributed to the reoccurrence of hMPV B2 rather than a novel variant.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapeutic resistance is a significant issue in the treatment of breast cancer, which is related to pyroptosis inhibition. Increasing evidence suggests that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to tumorigenesis and drug resistance. In this study we investigated the role of the lncRNA STMN1P2 in doxorubicin resistance in breast cancer, as well as its correlation with pyroptosis inhibition. Our results showed that the expression levels of lncRNA STMN1P2 were significantly elevated in doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer tissues and cells. We demonstrated that knockdown of STMN1P2 reduced doxorubicin resistance in breast cancer cells; overexpression of STMN1P2 inhibited doxorubicin-induced pyroptosis by reducing the expression of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1 and GSDMD. Furthermore, STMN1P2 directly bound to and positively regulated heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNPU), and knockdown of hnRNPU reversed the inhibitory effect of STMN1P2 on pyroptosis and its ability to promote chemoresistance. In doxorubicin-resistant cells, hnRNPU directly bound to enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2), and STMN1P2 enhanced hnRNPU recruitment of EZH2 and increased EZH2 protein stability. EZH2 acted as a transcription factor to inactivate TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), thereby repressing the binding of TRAF6 with MALT1 and caspase-1, attenuating the canonical pathways of pyroptosis. In MCF7/DOX cells xenograft nude mouse model, we demonstrated that knockdown of STMN1P2 significantly enhanced the suppression of doxorubicin on the tumour growth. This study provides new clues and approaches for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer chemoresistance.",

    "title": "Toothpaste made from hair provides natural root to repair teeth",
    "abstract": "Toothpaste made from your own hair may offer a sustainable and clinically effective way to protect and repair damaged teeth. In a new study published in Advanced Healthcare Materials, scientists discovered that keratin, a protein found in hair, skin and wool, can repair tooth enamel and stop early stages of decay. The King's College London team of scientists discovered that keratin produces a protective coating that mimics the structure and function of natural enamel when it comes into contact with minerals in saliva. Acidic foods and drinks, poor oral hygiene, and ageing all contribute to enamel erosion and decay, leading to tooth sensitivity, pain and eventually tooth loss.© Thomas Darcy/iStock/Getty Images Plus While fluoride toothpastes are currently used to slow this process, keratin-based treatments were found to stop it completely. Keratin forms a dense mineral layer that protects the tooth and seals off exposed nerve channels that cause sensitivity, offering both structural and symptomatic relief. The treatment could be delivered through a toothpaste for daily use or as a professionally applied gel, similar to nail varnish, for more targeted repair. The team is already exploring pathways for clinical application and believes that keratin-based enamel regeneration could be made available to the public within the next two to three years. In their study, the scientists extracted keratin from wool. They discovered that when keratin is applied to the tooth surface and comes into contact with the minerals naturally present in saliva, it forms a highly organised, crystal-like scaffold that mimics the structure and function of natural enamel. Over time, this scaffold continues to attract calcium and phosphate ions, leading to the growth of a protective enamel-like coating around the tooth. This marks a significant step forward in regenerative dentistry. Sara Gamea, PhD researcher at King's College London and first author of the study, added: ‘Keratin offers a transformative alternative to current dental treatments. Not only is it sustainably sourced from biological waste materials like hair and skin, it also eliminates the need for traditional plastic resins, commonly used in restorative dentistry, which are toxic and less durable. Keratin also looks much more natural than these treatments, as it can more closely match the colour of the original tooth.'

That's according toresearch published inAdvanced Science, where the robots used a new class of bioceramic cement to form durable seals in worn enamel. This reduces tooth sensitivity in one application by limiting access to nerve endings. While desensitising toothpastes have a similar effect at surface level, the robots are able to travel 300-500 micrometres into the dentinal tubules and form a solid plug. The robots were trialled on human teeth with exposed dentine that had been extracted for clinical reasons. The robots were applied under a magnetic field for 20 minutes, during which time they successfully formed deep, stable plugs. The study then progressed to animal trials. Mice with tooth sensitivity were found to prefer room temperature water over cold, while those with healthy teeth showed no preference.

    "title": "Online toolkit to help parents of autistic children improve dental health",
    "abstract": "A new, free, online support package aims to empower parents of young autistic children to look after their dental health - and reduce levels of tooth decay and surgery. It follows a study led by the University of Leeds, which highlights the oral health challenges faced by autistic children. The research team has collaborated with autistic youngsters, their families, and early years professionals to co-design the support package, following parents' calls for autism-specific advice on how to improve oral health habits. The toothPASTE website provides parents with practical, tailored solutions focusing on: toothbrushing, going to the dentist, and eating and drinking. It features videos, downloadable resources, and a forum where parents can share their experiences and advice. One in four autistic children have tooth decay by the age of five - similar to the wider childhood population - but they are less likely to visit the dentist and twice as likely to need dental treatment under general anaesthetic. For families of autistic children, building and keeping optimal oral health habits can be particularly difficult. This is due to additional challenges such as communication difficulties, sensory sensitivities, and restricted or repetitive behaviours. Dr Amrit Chauhan, Lecturer in Qualitative Methodology and Autism-related Oral Health Research within the School of Dentistry and a Chartered Psychologist at Leeds, who co-led the research, said: ‘We want to help parents feel more confident in caring for their young autistic children's teeth. That's why families of autistic children have been involved from the start of the study, and we have very much been led by them on what they want. ‘Every family is at a different point in their journey, and every child's needs are unique. So, on the website, we break things down into small, manageable steps. We take a gentle, gradual approach, recognising that for some children, making even one small change might take weeks or even months - and that's okay.'

Catherine will represent Dentaid at a range of events in the dental sector and beyond and meet with MPs, commissioners, public health teams and stakeholders across the dental industry to show the long-term benefit of Dentaid's work across the UK. As a result, awareness of Dentaid's nationwide projects and impact will increase as the charity raises funds to help more people than ever before - with more than 1,300 mobile charity dental clinics taking place in this financial year. Catherine will work alongside the charity's clinical team led by UK Clinical Director Dr Natalie Bradley. With a career spanning work as a dentist, coach and mentor, Catherine has run her own dental practice and more recently was clinical director for Denplan, where she represented Denplan and dentistry to MPs and other influential organisations in the dental and healthcare sectors. She has previously supported Denplan and Dentaid's oral health education programme BrightBites, delivering sessions to children in schools and advocating the importance of dental health education from a young age. Catherine said: ‘I'm hugely excited to be working at Dentaid in a new role. I love to learn and love to develop and can take the opportunity to learn from great people who have so much experience so I can provide some really positive benefits to the charity. ‘As Dentaid grows - and it's growing so fast - my focus is on making clear the really important things that the charity is doing, so we can make sure that we raise awareness at a wider and higher level with greater stakeholder engagement about why the work we do as a charity is so necessary and the purpose it provides. ‘I've already seen the impact that it creates for people in need, to really help in some ways to change their lives when they have nowhere else that they can go, and that is amazing.' Andy Evans, CEO of Dentaid the Dental Charity, added: ‘It's fantastic to have someone with as much knowledge about dentistry as Catherine joining us as Head of Policy. Having her skills and expertise to draw on will have a huge impact in allowing us to comment on and define policy in the industry in the future. ‘At a time when the industry is going through huge changes, it's important that Dentaid is able to shout loud about its work and the transformative impact it can have for so many people.' Catherine will also continue as Director of Policy and Research at the Association of Dental Groups alongside her role at Dentaid.

    "title": "Dental Specialty Fellowship Examinations offer  wider access to recognition",
    "abstract": "The Dental Faculty Deans of the UK's three surgical royal colleges have published the eligibility criteria for the new Dental Specialty Fellowship Examinations. The examinations will be introduced in autumn 2026 and will support trainees in demonstrating the specialist knowledge, skills and capabilities required for progression. The news follows extensive discussion and collaboration with stakeholders across the UK and Ireland. The new examinations offer multiple entry routes, accommodating dentists in formal UK specialty training, those undertaking postgraduate university clinical programmes, and practitioners who have trained overseas or have been working within a UK dental specialty for some time. This new framework broadens access and provides more opportunities for dentists to have their specialist knowledge, skills, and experience formally recognised through the award of a Fellowship in their chosen specialty by one of the UK's surgical Royal Colleges. In addition to the eligibility criteria, transitional considerations have been published for those who are already on, or will shortly begin, a training or educational pathway. Professor Christine Goodall, Vice President (Dental) and Dean of the Faculty of Dental Surgery at the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, said: ‘This initiative represents a joint effort by the Colleges to streamline and align the diverse landscape of dental specialty examinations. ‘The catalyst for this work was the introduction of the new General Dental Council (GDC)-approved curricula across ten dental specialties, which presented a rare, perhaps once-in-a-generation, opportunity to redesign our assessments and make them more accessible - particularly through the newly established open access route. ‘With the release of the eligibility criteria, we hope to enable many highly skilled professionals within the dental workforce to pursue formal recognition of their expertise. While a Fellowship alone does not guarantee inclusion on the GDC's specialist lists, it can play a significant role in a portfolio application, providing strong evidence of specialist-level competence and knowledge.'

In the dental clinic, a dentist's charisma, expressed through confidence, warmth, and clear communication can greatly enhance patient care and practice success. Charismatic communication helps build patient trust, reduce dental anxiety, improve treatment acceptance and compliance, and ultimately fosters patient satisfaction and loyalty. This first article in a two-part series explores how cultivating charisma at the chairside benefits the dentist-patient relationship and practice growth. Drawing on dentistry and psychology research, we examine charisma's role in effective patient communication, trust-building, alleviating anxiety, and encouraging treatment adherence. By treating charisma as a learnable clinical skill, dentists can improve not only the patient experience but also the success and reputation of their practice.",

    "title": "Tributes to Kevin Lewis from BDA Indemnity",
    "abstract": "On 31 July 2025, it was announced that our colleague and dear friend, Kevin Lewis, passed away. Here, colleagues from theBDA Indemnity teampast and present pay their tributes to a man whose warmth, generosity, humour and knowledge transcended the profession. ‘He was never too busy to take a call or reply to an email which was always perfectly crafted' Everyone who knew Kevin will have two things they treasure and never tire of sharing with anyone who will listen. The first will be the first time they came across him, either because they heard him speak, read one of his many brilliantly crafted articles or in the case of many dento-legal advisors when he interviewed them. I first saw him delivering a day's talk on practice management back in 1993 with a slide deck that was both informative and hilarious in equal measure. His favoured illustration of how dentists reacted to more bad news about the NHS contract was using children's characters like Henny Penny, the associate who runs around thinking the sky is falling in who relates her fears about it to Goosey Loosely, the LDC chairperson, and other dental characters like Foxy Loxy and Cocky Locky. In my later years when given the choice, I never wanted to speak after he had been on stage worrying naturally that my offering would be a pale imitation of his erudite and articulate performance, always funny and insightful. The second thing people will share anecdotes about Kevin will be illustrative of his patient listening skills, insightful commentary, supportive words, inspirational leadership and his beguiling sense of humour and anecdotes delivered with impeccable timing and many accents. I will particularly miss his wise counsel at BDA Indemnity, a service that would not have come to fruition had he not been at its helm in 2018. He was never too busy to take a call or reply to an email which was always perfectly crafted, detailed and signed off with his signature; Kx. Time will heal the pain of his loss but time will not forget him. I feel privileged and honoured to have walked this earth with him. Len D'Cruz, Head of BDA Indemnity ‘BDA Indemnity would not have existed had it not been for Kevin' Sure, the time was right, and members were telling us that they wanted an alternative to the long-established players. But timing and need would not have been sufficient to create the successful platform that we see today. The turnkey development was Kevin Lewis becoming suddenly available following his retirement from Dental Protection. His encyclopaedic knowledge of professional indemnity coupled with his learning along the twenty-odd year journey at DPL offered the BDA a unique asset in setting things up. We were able to hit the ground running and head into the necessary meetings with the equivalent of Lawrence Dallaglio on our team. The credibility of having someone so experienced opened many doors and closed down many redundant arguments. Be it with financiers, insurance professionals or actuaries, Kevin's presence got the job done. As importantly, Kevin's contacts book was gold dust. The industry specialists we needed were all in there. Singling any one of his contacts out in this regard is difficult, but I will do it any way. The amazing Fenella Barnes had worked at DPL initially in Australia and had joined Kevin's team in London. Kevin's recognition of Fenella's ‘brain-the-size-of-a-planet' actuarial skill set and his trust in her was yet another vital component of our nascent offering. Without Kevin there would have been no Fenella; Without Fenella, again, there would have been no BDA Indemnity. Having tapped Kevin's wisdom, expertise and negotiating skills we then used his insights to populate the team with known and trusted colleagues who we knew could do the job well from day one. The fact that he knew them was no less important than the fact that they knew him. Kevin's personal brand of integrity, fairness and pragmatism was a vital imprimatur for anyone we needed. So it was that The BDA was able to negotiate, build, structure and populate a completely new service offering in less than a year and for that offering to fly off the shelves in record time. What none of us knew was that the COVID pandemic was round the corner and with it all its business-threatening consequences. The timing of the BDA's Indemnity product proved to be not a moment too soon. As practices were shaving the ‘nice-to-have's' from their expenses BDA membership could have been a casualty. But the presence of such a high-quality and essential service ensured the BDA's continuing relevance. So, the legion of us that owe thanks to one man goes on and on: Hard-pressed dentists looking for a fair and equitable indemnity product; The members of the BDA who benefit on a daily basis from the tireless efforts the Association on their behalf; The draftsmen and developers of the new offering; the erstwhile employees and advisers from DPL who were feeling lost and disenfranchised by the new direction of that enterprise; but mostly all the Friends of Kevin who have known him for so long and have enjoyed his company, kindness and wicked wit. I count myself amongst all of these groups but most particularly the last. I knew Kevin for forty years and our career journeys overlapped and interweaved. He was a loyal, reliable ally and a source of unerring wisdom. His impact on UK dentistry is far greater than many will ever realise. For those of us who knew him well, we mourn the passing of our great friend. Peter Ward, former Chief Executive, BDA ‘I will continue to channel my inner Kevin voice when advocating for my dental colleagues' I first met Kevin when he interviewed me for my role as a dento-legal advisor 10 years ago. For someone so well known, he immediately put me at ease, and we ended up talking about everyday topics. Thinking back and knowing him now, it was probably his way of getting a measure of me. I felt instantly relaxed and warmed to his style. This continued whilst I worked at Dental Protection, always fascinated by his story telling and in awe of his knowledge, skills, friendliness, and ability to guide using my ideas but with incredible subtle direction, based on his experience and insightful views of a situation. ‘ I considered him a mentor, honourable and respected leader and importantly ally and friend' I had the pleasure of continuing to work with Kevin within my role as a DLA, now with BDA Indemnity, discussing various aspects of dentistry and indemnity at weekly meetings. I maintained my amazement at his knowledge and speed of response. He listened. He then replied to the point, always detailed and informative, often with humour, wit, insight and charm. Kevin guided me to the evidence I needed to make my decisions, usually with extra information scattered in for good measure. I considered him a mentor, honourable and respected leader and importantly ally and friend. Someone I could easily pose a question to and always knew I would receive a quick, often detailed, no doubt genius informative and humorous response back. I will continue to channel my inner Kevin voice when advocating for my dental colleagues and would hope in some small way to be able to continue his dento-legal legacy. However, having said that, I would prefer to hear directly from him. He leaves a huge gaping Kevin size hole. I we will miss him dearly. Clare Lawrence, Dento-legal Advisor ‘Kevin's enduring gift to the dental profession continues to support the values of the team' I first met Kevin at a board meeting for Dental Practice Magazine in 1988. It is no longer in print, but Kevin regularly contributed the leading editorial, whilst I was a slightly more occasional contributor. Despite the busy board agenda, he took the time to chat and always commented on any articles I had written. The AIDS pandemic created an opportunity to write about managing the dental needs of patients living with HIV/AIDS. Many dentists were reluctant to provide such treatment in the early years, and it was not long before the GDC was investigating complaints against registrants accused of discriminatory behaviour. Kevin was now a dento-legal advisor for Dental Protection (DPL), and I was asked to act as an expert for them, in my capacity as clinical lead for a dedicated HIV dental service provided by volunteer GDPs in Community Dental Service premises. Our paths now crossed more frequently and just before the millennium, when Kevin learned that I was selling my practice to a corporate entity - he asked what I was thinking of doing next? He smiled when I asked if, by any chance, I could do anything useful for DPL. I had invited him to lunch, and really had no idea just how often he was asked that question, but he gently explained that having been in post as Dental Director for two years, his plan was to grow the membership, and there could possibly be a role for me the following year - Stephen Hancocks was leaving DPL and there would be a Communications gap! So started a very happy 17-year period working alongside Kevin as the Communications Manager and he even had a section of the Director's office partitioned off to accommodate me. I worked part-time at DPL, as well as doing some clinical work, and shared the newly created room with Raj Rattan (currently Dental Director of DPL). It was a small cold room, and I had asked for an electric radiator. Imagine my surprise when I switched it on, to find it billowed smoke and flames I was unaware that Raj had let fall a panoramic x-ray film into the heater the previous day. The Peterborough train was delayed by snow that morning, so Kevin arrived to find the caretaker removing the secondary glazing from the first-floor office windows to get rid of the smoke and secretaries sitting in their overcoats. When he arrived, Kevin called me into his office but never mentioned the fire; he wanted to discuss his ideas for a new look for all the publications and in particular the Annual Review. His neat hand-written notes filled the ruled pages of his blue Cambridge Counsels Notebook. His attention to detail was driven by his own passion for the printing process. In addition to the grammar and the spelling being correct, the aesthetic of the design, the photography and the paper stock were equally important to Kevin and were scrutinised in great detail when the designer presented the proofs. Kevin's passion for achieving the highest standards in all aspects of dental indemnity was aligned to a desire to ensure good value was also achieved. He led by example, and as many of the team working for DPL moved on to other jobs, those same values have moved with them. Kevin's enduring gift to the dental profession continues to support the values of the team at BDA Indemnity. David Croser, Consultant Dental Advisor ‘Kevin was a one-of-a-kind leader, mentor, and friend' My first encounter with Kevin was at the final round interview for the role of Dento-legal Advisor, 11 years ago. Taking the lift down to the interview room at 9am, he glanced at my glass of water and joked, ‘Why didn't you bring me a gin and tonic as well?'. That single comment broke the ice, setting the tone for a relaxed interview conducted in Kevin's unique style. I left the room with a strong hope that I would have the opportunity to work with Kevin. I learned later that despite this informal manner, Kevin had - quietly and efficiently, gathered all the important information he needed about me before offering me the job. ‘He will be missed from team meetings at BDA Indemnity, where we valued expertise and because he brought laughter to the room' Of course, the knowledge that I gained from Kevin relating to dentistry and the dento-legal field is invaluable, however, I respected him most for his ability to engage with people. He always took time to put his head round the office door in Cavendish Square to say hello and tell a story or share an experience. He will be missed from team meetings at BDA Indemnity, where we valued expertise and because he brought laughter to the room. He knew how to connect with his audience, even when the topic was mundane, making every conversation lively and memorable. Kevin made time for people and managed to make each person feel truly special. Despite his busy schedule, he was always responsive to my questions, and when we met in person, he never failed to enquire about my family and wellbeing, always remembering the details that mattered. Kevin was a one-of-a-kind leader, mentor, and friend, someone who will truly be missed.

    "abstract": "I was recently invited to speak at a BDA complaints-focused training day, and to be honest, I was completely in awe of the other speakers - their ability, their experience, and the clarity with which they shared their knowledge. A touch of ‘imposter syndrome' crept in at first, but very quickly, I realised exactly where my own voice fitted in - and how my perspective complemented and added real value to the day.Practice manager‘s are on the front line of the business. It is up to us to equip our teams with the tools, training, and confidence they need to handle complaints - not just reactively, but proactively. So that is where I focused my session: the real-world stuff that ties it all together. From understanding the patient journey and internal culture to navigating social media (and all its glory and chaos), I explored how communication, rapport, and emotional intelligence are the secret ingredients to handling complaints with confidence and care.",

    "abstract": "When I first started working in the dental industry back in 2006, the landscape looked quite different. It was standard for associates to be on a 50% split - straightforward, generous, and frankly not much of a negotiation point. Recruitment was relatively easy too. There was a steady stream of dentists looking for work, and principals generally had the upper hand. Fast-forward nearly two decades, and it's fair to say the balance of power has shifted quite dramatically.As dentistry evolved, so too did the web of compliance, regulation, and financial pressure. Remember the dreaded HTM01-05? That was a defining moment in modern dental compliance. Infection control protocols went from being good practice to rigidly enforced policy, and with that came mounting costs - for equipment, training, documentation, audits, refurbishments, and more. Understandably, principals couldn't absorb all of those expenses indefinitely.",

    "abstract": "In part two Barry discusses his time as CDO, including the implementation of contract reform.My first few days at the DH had been difficult; finding out that what I wanted to do around a new contract currency based on capitation was not going to happen in the short term and wondering what the future held. I currently work with a leadership mentoring programme at Birmingham University and my interest in mentoring probably flows from my own experience. Prior to joining DH, Dame Margaret Seward had become a major influence on my career and it was Margaret who stepped in after I was appointed. As a former CDO she had seen it all and explained that the DH desperately needed a dentist with a credible background in primary care in this newly created deputy CDO post and I was, in her opinion, the right person for the role. I was reeling after my first few days but Margaret came to the rescue, she told me that I was too focused on dental remuneration and that, in reality, there was no good way to pay dentists that worked for everyone and made everyone happy. She explained that there was so much more in dentistry that had not changed for years and needed addressing. Margaret believed that it was only somebody from outside the existing structures that could change things. She also said that anybody leading change was bound to come in for criticism from those comfortable with the status quo and that I should be prepared for that. A few years later I saw this blatantly demonstrated when I attended my first meeting at the Faculty of Dental Surgery after being appointed Acting CDO. I met with the then Dean of the Faculty and he asked me to my face, ‘When are they going to appoint a proper CDO?' When I asked what he meant by that he quite openly replied ‘one with a decent set of letters after his name!' Despite all this I considered it an honour to be the first Chief Dental Officer with a background in general practice.",

    "title": "Supervised toothbrushing: What oral healthcare teams  in practice need to know",
    "abstract": "ByAnna Hunt1,Samantha Watt2andZoe Marshman2 In March, the government announced an investment of £11 million, for 2025-26 to support supervised toothbrushing programmes (STP) for children aged 3-5 years living in the most deprived areas of England. The funding aims to support up to 600,000 children to undertake supervised toothbrushing and has been given to local authorities (LAs) who are responsible for the commissioning of oral health promotion programmes. In 2024, there was an estimated 150,000 children taking part from 90 LAs across England.1Additionally, the government announced a collaboration withColgate-Palmolivewho have pledged to provide 23 million toothbrushes and fluoride toothpaste over five years to support both supervised toothbrushing schemes and at-home brushing. Evidence fromChildsmile, the national child oral health programme in Scotland, suggests that supervised toothbrushing can be effective in reducing the prevalence and social inequalities in dental caries and is cost-effective.2The evaluation ofChildsmilefound that to reduce the prevalence of tooth decay children needed to be involved in supervised toothbrushing for at least 12 months with the greatest benefit seen when children participated for 36 months. For every £1 spent on STP, there is an estimated return on investment for the NHS of £3 over a 5-year period.2,3,4Improving children's oral health is a priority for government departments of both health and education because of the impact dental caries can have on young children's health, development, educational attendance and quality of life.5Supervised toothbrushing is included in the recent NHS 10 year plan6and the Department for Education's ‘Giving every child the Best Start in Life' strategy.7Dental health is already part of the Early Years statutory requirements.8Running a toothbrushing club is one way early years settings can show they are meeting this part of the curriculum and helping to support children to be ‘school ready'.9 Supervised toothbrushing takes place in early-years settings (schools, nurseries or childminders) where children brush their own teeth daily with fluoride toothpaste (1,350 to 1,500ppm) overseen by trained early-years staff. The whole activity typically takes less than ten minutes and is undertaken at a convenient time as part of the daily timetable. There are lots of ‘myths' circulating about children queuing for teachers to brush their teeth and schools needing to install lots of sinks. However, in most parts of the country, nurseries and schools use a ‘dry brushing' approach without the use of water, or a sink. Children sit on the carpet or at tables with their own identifiable brush and fluoride toothpaste dispensed onto a paper towel or plate. The brushes are rinsed and stored individually in specifically designed racks. Most early years settings use songs or video clips of two minutes duration to help make toothbrushing more engaging. This daily activity ensures an additional exposure to fluoride toothpaste as well as helping children develop their toothbrushing skills. Supervised toothbrushing is intended to supplement home-based toothbrushing undertaken by parents and carers. National guidance was published in April to support the commissioning and delivering of supervised toothbrushing schemes.10Supervised toothbrushing programmes are commissioned either by a single local authority (LA) or across a larger footprint with some funded by both LA and the NHS. The LA Public Health team and early years teams are involved alongside local Consultants in Dental Public Health who provide specialist advice to the STP. The STP provides the protocol for early years settings, training, support and a quality assurance process. Early years staff are trained by oral health teams employed by an LA or the NHS. Quality assurance takes place regularly to check that it is being provided in a safe and effective way. Oral healthcare teams have a vital role in advocating for and promoting the uptake of STP with families. Oral healthcare professionals should be proactive in discussing these programmes with children and their parents and carers, explaining the benefits of being involved. If a parent or carer reports that their child's early years setting runs a STP, but their child is not participating, the oral healthcare team can offer reassurance. They can explain that STP follow strict quality and infection control standards, and that participation offers significant oral health benefits, as shown inBox 1.For those whose early years setting does not currently offer an STP, dental teams can encourage and empower parents and carers to raise the issue with the setting. As a result of the government announcement, many LAs are looking to expand STPs, and parental interest can be a key driver in encouraging early years settings to get involved. Through these actions, oral healthcare teams can contribute significantly to increasing participation in STPs and improving oral health outcomes for young children.Box 1.  Practical tips for oral healthcare professionals to promote supervised toothbrushing.Questions for the oral healthcare team to ask children and their parents and carers:1.Have you heard about supervised toothbrushing in nurseries and schools?2.Does the early years setting they go to have one?3.Does their child take part?Benefits of supervised toothbrushing schemes:Prevention of tooth decay and its consequencesTeaching and instilling lifelong toothbrushing skillsEncourages and helps with home brushing. Parents of young children find a lot of resistance from children brushing at home and do report that when their children take part in supervised toothbrushing at nursery/school it makes the children happier to do it at home.Similarities and differences between brushing at home and at nursery/school:Similarities:Own brushFluoride toothpasteBrush for 2 minutesAn adult checks that they are doing it rightDifferencesNo mirrorsNo sinksBrush sitting down rather than standing upOften brush along to a video or song As described above, there are many stakeholders involved in STP who are key to the programmes being effective at reducing dental caries and to sustaining the STPs long term. Below, key stakeholders involved in STP share their perspectives.Jill Allbutt, Oral Health Improvement Service Lead, Shropshire Community Health NHS TrustI led the development of a supervised toothbrushing programme in Stoke-on-Trent in 2016 and I am now the Lead for an Oral Health Improvement Service in a Community NHS Trust which is commissioned by Integrated Care Boards. The service delivers a range of evidence-based community interventions, including STP, across four LAs. I work closely with the local Consultant in Dental Public Health who provides leadership to support the programmes and their ongoing development.At a strategic level I oversee the expansion and delivery of the supervised toothbrushing programme. This includes engaging with LAs, headteachers, early years leads and wider education and health partners to support settings and promote the benefits of daily supervised toothbrushing.Locally, I lead on the training and development of oral health improvement practitioners to deliver the programmes, and am responsible for planning the delivery, activity and quality monitoring, and rollout out of our local STP for 3-5-year-olds in day nurseries, mainstream schools, and 3 years upwards in SEND schools. The programme specifically targets early years settings serving the 20% most deprived areas. We follow the national guidance for supervised toothbrushing to ensure it is delivered safely, effectively and consistently and in accordance with current Infection Prevention and Control standards.I believe supervised toothbrushing is one of the simplest, most effective ways we can support children's oral health, especially in communities where tooth decay is still far too common.I have seen first-hand how a small daily habit - taking only 5-10 minutes in a nursery or school, can make a big difference, not just in oral health outcomes but in building school readiness and confidence in young children. For me, it is about more than just brushing teeth. It's about giving the young children the best possible start in life and helping to remove preventable barriers to learning and thriving.In our area the supervised toothbrushing has been well received. We have over 160 targeted settings currently participating and it continues to grow. We focused on making the programme as simple and practical as possible - providing clear guidance, ready to use resources, training that fits around busy school routines and promotional material to raise awareness of the programme. The success we have seen so far, I feel comes down to strong partnerships. Day nursery managers, early years leads and headteachers are often enthusiastic once they understand how little time it takes, how well it fits into existing routines and how much it benefits the children. Consent rates in settings are almost 100%.The programme is intended to be in addition to any home toothbrushing and many parents report their child being more willing to clean their teeth at home and allow their parents to help them, which reduces some of the stresses experienced when getting children ready for nursery/school or at bedtime.We are continuing to grow participation steadily and feedback from schools has been key to refining our approach. It has become a valued part of the wider work to reduce inequalities in oral health in areas where a high percentage of children starting nursery already experienced tooth decay.Victoria Major, Children's Health Improvement Coordinator, Herefordshire Public Health, Herefordshire CouncilMy role in Herefordshire supervised toothbrushing has largely been project management. I am the person who works with the early years settings delivering the STP. I have lots of oral health promotion experience in my previous roles in early years and family support; rather than a dental background, with oral health advice coming from the local Consultant in Dental Public Health.It has been an honour and delight to build this programme from scratch in 2021 with 0 settings involved to now in 2025 a total of 45 early years providers involved and enjoying the programme. Initially my role at the council allowed my full focus to be on children's oral health which meant I could learn more about the settings involved, build relationships and trust and then create an ‘offer' that was localised and fit the needs of our area. Our offer incorporates fun and creative ideas to maintain engagement with the settings and parents which is so important to keeping up momentum.Herefordshire is a highly rural and agricultural area. Compared to urban areas, while the number of children living in deprived areas may be lower, the poverty some families experience is still really significant. So families may be seen to live in large farm houses but their income is very low. Families also have to travel miles to get to an early years setting highlighting the importance of these settings to promote oral health. Knowing the needs of the area and the families living there has been vital to the success of the programme.‘ Improving children's oral health is a priority for government departments of both health and education because of the impact dental caries can have on young children's health, development, educational attendance and quality of life.'I have watched our STP grow from strength to strength and witnessed huge progression among the children. Something I always reiterate to settings is that supervised toothbrushing isn't a replacement for home brushing it's to encourage a positive experience of toothbrushing, it's about getting children to watch their peers, have fun with oral health, learn different techniques in a relaxed and positive capacity, this is to take the chore out of brushing!Laura MacRae, Teacher and Early Years Foundation Stage Leader and Abbie Smith, Teacher and SEND co-ordinator, St Nicholas Church of England Primary Academy, Boston, LincolnshireA lot of our children come to school with really poor teeth. It's heart-breaking to see the amount of children we've had in pain and agony, how can you learn if you're in pain? You can't! I remember one child who had to have all of his baby teeth removed, and the effect on his speech was so upsetting because he just couldn't talk. So, we feel it's a real big need for our children to get that extra brushing, or actually the only brush that they will have every day. Dental health is part of our curriculum. It is part of our science curriculum and part of relationships education, relationships and sex education and health education (RSHE). We have the educational side built in and the actual physical daily toothbrushing for two minutes and then we send the toothbrush and toothpaste pack home with them to make sure they have what they need to brush their teeth at home too. The Lincolnshire Smiles team come in at the start of each year to introduce the programme and then once every term to check we are doing it correctly.Parent of a 3-year-old girl attending a nursery in SheffieldWe had problems with toothbrushing to begin with and my daughter was taking food from her brother when I wasn't looking and she got hooked on sweets at a very young age. I was very gentle with her at first when she didn't want to brush, just giving her the toothbrush and letting her do it herself but obviously she wasn't doing a good job and she ended up having teeth out. It scared me! When she woke up from the anaesthetic, I've never seen her so angry, and blood was dripping from her mouth. Then she couldn't speak for a few days and her mouth was sore. It has taught me a lesson though that even when my child doesn't want something, it doesn't mean it's good for them. I will pin my child down and make sure they brush their teeth now. They have really encouraged toothbrushing at the nursery and I think it's really helped at home too. It would be nice to come in and watch them brush their teeth in there, we could pick up some tips as well on how to help brush their teeth!Jennie Ross, Associate Dentist, Richmond Dental Care, SheffieldWorking in NHS General Dental Practice I have had young patients come in really proud to tell me that they are brushing their teeth at nursery or pre-school and what they have learnt about doing it properly. They tell me about brushing for two minutes and making sure not to rinse afterwards. I have even had one parent tell me how their child now makes sure all the other family members are brushing twice a day too. Initially, I was not sure how the programme worked but I have now seen some videos online and learnt how schools and nurseries are able to integrate it into their day.‘ Oral healthcare professionals should be proactive in discussing these programmes with children and their parents and carers, explaining the benefits of being involved'It is great to hear that the messages we are giving families are being supported in other settings, and so regularly compared to the two to four times a year we would normally see children in practice. This is also being reinforced through dental nurses from our practice visiting local community centres, GPs or family hubs to discuss oral health and offer access to appointments at our practice, as part of a contract that has been commissioned locally. STPs are simple and effective at preventing dental caries in young children. While they require funding and stakeholder engagement to be successfully established and maintained, they can be integrated with other initiatives within early years settings to align with national requirements for early years education. The whole dental team has an important role to play in promoting STPs to their practice population. Dental professionals can contact their local Consultants in Dental Public Health for further information or approach their Local Authorities to learn more about STPs available in their area.More details about STP can be found at:https://www.supervisedtoothbrushing.com/.

    "title": "APOL proteins tune gut immunity via commensal lipid recognition",
    "abstract": "In a recent paper published inNature, Yang and colleagues identified a novel lipid–protein interaction that broadly regulates the behavior of dominant gut bacteria from theBacteroidestaxa. This interaction, in turn, tunes the expression of immune-regulating molecules in intestinal epithelial cells and promotes the expansion of specialized immune cells important for gut health. Host–microbe mutualism relies on a delicate balance. The host immune system must control commensal microbe population while promoting “beneficial” function to the host.1Meanwhile, microbes compete for space and nutrients with each other and evolve strategies to persist within the host.2Although factors such as short-chain fatty acids promote mutualism, the full range of host- and microbe-derived factors that promote mutualism remains poorly defined.3Uncovering what these factors are and how they interact could lead to fundamental insights into the nature of symbiosis and its evolutionary origins. This line of inquiry also holds significant potential for identifying novel microbiome-targeted therapies, underscoring its biomedical relevance. To identify host proteins that interact with the microbiota, Yang and colleagues performed a proteomic screen comparing ileal mucus from germ-free (GF) mice and conventionally raised (CR) mice, and microbiota-enriched protein fractions from CR mice.4This analysis identified apolipoprotein L9a and L9b (APOL9a/b) as the most enriched proteins in both the total mucus and microbiota-bound fractions of CR mice, but absent in ileal mucus of GF mice. APOL9a/b, belonging to the APOL family, are known to be interferon-inducible and are also reported to be expressed in tissues such as the liver and intestine.5,6Importantly, they have not been associated with interactions with the commensal bacteria. To determine which microbes these proteins target, the authors developed “APOL9-seq”, a modified version of IgA-seq, in which recombinant APOL9 proteins were used to label bacteria from CR mice before flow cytometry and 16S rRNA profiling.7This approach revealed that APOL9a/b selectively bound members of genusBacteroides, a finding confirmed by co-culture experiments with individual strains. Reasoning that APOL9 may recognize unique lipids inBacteroides, the authors turned toBacteroides thetaiotaomicron(B. theta), a genetically tractable gut symbiont. Genetic deletion of enzymes required for ceramide-1-phosphate (Cer1P) synthesis inB. thetaabolished APOL9 binding. This effect was observed across both mouse and human APOL orthologs, with APOL2 identified as the functional human counterpart. Direct lipid-binding assays further confirmed that APOL9a and APOL2 bound specifically to Cer1P, but not to unphosphorylated ceramides. These results establish Cer1P as the microbial ligand recognized by host APOL proteins. Interestingly, while APOL9 binding did not affectB. thetagrowth under in vitro conditions, it induced membrane perturbation and enhanced outer membrane vesicle (OMV) release, as shown by electron microscopy. OMV induction was absent when Cer1P-deficientB. thetastrains were used, confirming that APOL–Cer1P interactions trigger this response. Transcriptomic analysis of bacteria exposed to APOL9 or APOL2 showed upregulation of stress and membrane biogenesis genes, suggesting that OMV release reflects a stress adaptation rather than a direct antimicrobial effect. To determine whether APOL-induced OMVs impact host immunity, the authors examined epithelial and immune responses inApol9a/b-knockout mice. Bulk RNA-seq of ileal epithelial cells showed reduced expression of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) and interferon-γ (IFNγ) genes in knockout animals, which was restored by treatment withB. theta-derived OMVs both in vitro and in vivo. Using a co-culture system, the authors demonstrated that OMVs stimulate dendritic cells, in turn promoting epithelial MHC-II expression in a TLR2-MyD88-dependent manner. Single-cell RNA-seq of intraepithelial CD45⁺ immune cells revealed thatApol9a/b-deficient mice had a marked reduction in CD4⁺CD8αα⁺TCRαβ⁺ intraepithelial lymphocytes, a population previously implicated in maintaining mucosal tolerance and resistance to infection. Loss of these cells correlated with impaired control of oralSalmonella typhimuriuminfection, leading to increased pathogen burden, systemic dissemination, and mortality. Notably, these phenotypes were rescued by oral administration of OMVs fromB. theta. This study reveals an unexpected function for APOL proteins in promoting intestinal immune homeostasis through selective recognition of commensal lipids (Fig.1). The discovery that a “non-immune” host protein can detect a “non-self” microbial lipid and initiate such a cascade challenges conventional boundaries between innate immunity, microbial sensing, and metabolic regulation. It suggests that host surveillance of the microbiota may involve a broader repertoire of molecular sensors, including metabolic proteins not traditionally associated with immune function. As the authors mention in their discussion, it is possible that commensal bacteria such asB. thetamay have evolved lipid molecules like Cer1P not only for structural or metabolic purposes, but also to engage with stable, less inflammatory host pathways.8Indeed, such adaptations could confer competitive advantages by promoting tolerance and long-term persistence in the gut environment. Alternatively, it is also conceivable that strains that did not adopt Cer1P synthesis were outcompeted. In this scenario, Cer1P synthesis-negative strains would have had to adopt alternative pathways to maintain their fitness in the presence of Cer1P-synthesizing strains; however, such questions would need to be addressed in a future follow-up study. Conversely, host recognition of these microbial lipids through non-immune proteins like APOL9 may reflect an evolutionary strategy to co-opt metabolic signaling for immune modulation, enabling fine-tuned responses that preserve mutualism without triggering full immune activation.Fig. 1: APOL-mediated modulation of gut immunity through commensal lipid sensing.Apolipoprotein L (APOL) proteins are secreted by intestinal epithelial cells into the gut lumen, where they bind specifically toB. thetavia recognition of Cer1P lipids on the bacterial surface. This interaction induces the release of OMVs fromB. theta, which in turn stimulate dendritic cells. IFNγ signaling promotes MHC-II expression on epithelial cells, supporting the expansion of CD4⁺CD8αα⁺TCRαβ⁺ intraepithelial lymphocytes.

    "abstract": "The pre-dimerization of endosome-localized RNA sensor Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) is required for its innate recognition, yet how TLR3 pre-dimers are formed and precisely primed for innate activation remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that endosome-localized self RNARmrpdirectly binds to TLR3 and induces TLR3 dimerization in the early endosome but does not interact with endosome-localized TLR7, TLR8, TLR9 or cytoplasmic RNA sensor RIG-I under homeostatic conditions. Cryo-EM structure ofRmrp–TLR3 complex reveals a novel lapped conformation of TLR3 dimer engaged byRmrp, which is distinct from the activation mechanism by dsRNA and the specific structural feature at the 3’-end ofRmrpis critical for its functional interaction with TLR3. Furthermore, K42 residue of TLR3 is essential for binding toRmrpand subsequent dimerization.Rmrpdissociates from TLR3 following endosomal acidification, generating a matured TLR3 dimer which is primed for innate recognition and activation. Myeloid-cell deficiency ofRmrpreduces TLR3 dimerization and attenuates TLR3-mediated antiviral responses against influenza A both in vitro and in vivo. These findings elucidate the structural mode of self RNARmrp-primed TLR3 dimerization and ready for efficient innate recognition on endosomal membrane, extending our knowledge of how membrane-associated TLRs pre-dimerize and suggesting a new function of subcellular localized self RNAs in empowering innate activation.",

    "title": "FBXW7 is a multifaceted regulator of the innate immune response to DNA viruses",
    "abstract": "Upon DNA virus infection, cGAS senses viral DNA and triggers MITA (also called STING)-dependent induction of type I interferons (IFN-Is) and other cytokines/chemokines. IFN-Is further activate STAT1/2 to induce interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and the innate antiviral response. How the innate antiviral response is silenced in uninfected cells and efficiently mounts upon viral infection is not fully understood. In this study, we found that FBXW7, a substrate recognition component of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, is a multifaceted regulator of the innate immune response to DNA viruses. In uninfected cells, FBXW7 mediates the polyubiquitination and degradation of GSK3α/β-phosphorylated SLC35B2/3 at the Golgi apparatus. This leads to the downregulation of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (sGAGs) in the Golgi apparatus and the inactivation of MITA in uninfected cells. In addition, FBXW7 mediates the degradation of GSK3α/β-phosphorylated MYC, which is a repressor of STAT1/2, leading to proper STAT1/2 levels in uninfected cells. The differential regulation of FBXW7 on MITA and STAT1/2 ensures inactivation but is ready for fast mount of the innate immune response in uninfected cells. Infection with DNA viruses activates the PI3K‒AKT axis, which inactivates GSK3α/β and inhibits FBXW7-mediated polyubiquitination and degradation of SLC35B2/3, leading to increased production of sGAGs, activation of MITA and rapid onset of the innate antiviral response. Consistently, gene disruption experiments indicate that FBXW7 modulates the innate antiviral response in human THP-1 and mouse BMDM cells. These findings suggest that FBXW7 functions as a versatile regulator of the innate immune response to DNA viruses by differentially regulating upstream and downstream components of the type I interferon induction loop.",

    "title": "Gut-derived indole propionic acid alleviates liver fibrosis by targeting profibrogenic macrophages via the gut‒liver axis",
    "abstract": "Gut-derived metabolites are essential for liver fibrogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine the alteration of indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), a crucial tryptophan metabolite, in liver fibrosis and delineate the roles of enterogenic IPA in fibrogenesis. In the present study, metabolomics assays focused on tryptophan metabolism were applied to explore the decreased levels of IPA in the feces and serum of cirrhotic patients, as well as in the feces and portal vein serum of fibrotic mice. Oral IPA administration exerted strong antifibrotic effects with favorable biosafety in three fibrotic models via multicellular modulation. Multiplex immunohistochemical staining and DAOSLIMIT imaging demonstrated that gut-derived IPA was directly captured by hepatic macrophages. Macrophage-specific AhR knockout blocked the antifibrotic effect of IPA, while the therapeutic efficacy was maintained in mice with HSC- or hepatocyte-specific AhR depletion. Furthermore, IPA governed macrophage recruitment, S100A8/A9+phenotype transformation and profibrotic and proinflammatory functions, resulting in amelioration of hepatic fibrogenesis. Mechanistically, IPA targeted the AhR/NF-κB/S100A8/A9 axis and AhR/SPHK2/S1P signaling to inhibit the profibrotic biological characteristics of macrophages and subsequently interrupted the profibrogenic crosstalk between macrophages and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in coculture systems and 3D liver spheroid models. These findings increase the understanding of the effects of enterogenic tryptophan metabolites on liver fibrogenesis via the gut‒liver axis and support the translational potential of IPA. By targeting profibrogenic macrophages, IPA could serve as a promising candidate for the clinical management of liver fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is hampered by issues of nonresponse and resistance, highlighting the urgent need for alternative or complementary treatments. Our study revealed significant upregulation of taurine in the intestinal tissues of IBD patients, which was inversely related to the severity of the disease. A key discovery was that TNF directly induced taurine synthesis in intestinal epithelial cells and increased the production of angiogenin, a nuclease that degrades mitochondrial RNA, which is known to amplify inflammatory responses. By degrading mitochondrial RNA, angiogenin inhibits the inflammatory response in macrophages, suggesting a potent immune-modulatory role for taurine. This mechanism implies that taurine could serve as an adjunct to anti-TNF therapies, enhancing their efficacy and providing a novel strategy for the management of IBD and other chronic inflammatory diseases by harnessing the body’s innate immune regulatory mechanisms.",

BMC Oral Health 2025;25: 159.https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-025-05521-5.DesignA double blinded 18-month randomised controlled trial was carried out to compare the clinical performance of fibre reinforced resin composites compared to conventional nanohybrid resin composites in restoring Class II MOD cavities. Participants were allocated to one of three groups: Group 1 with short glass fibre reinforced resin composite, Group 2 with polyethylene fibre reinforced resin composite and Group 3 with conventional nanohybrid resin composite. A principal investigator carried out the restorative procedures for all participants.Case selectionParticipants in the study were enrolled from the educational clinic in Cairo University, Egypt. A total of 45 participants with a mean age of 32.3 ± 7.3 years were included. All participants had class II MOD carious lesions in vital posterior teeth with ICDAS scores of 3,4 or 5. Additionally only those with good oral hygiene, a healthy periodontal status and normal occlusion were included. The study excluded pregnant patients, as well as those with systemic disease or evidence of parafunctional habits. Patients with hypersensitivity, allergy to materials used, secondary caries or delayed response to sensibility testing were also excluded.Data analysisOutcomes were assessed by two examiners at the baseline and at the following time intervals: 3, 6, 12, 18 months using Modified USPHS criteria. The primary outcome assessed was marginal adaptation, followed by gross fracture, marginal discolouration, colour match and recurrent caries. The clinical significance was determined based on relative risk. The chi-Square test compared between groups with significance set at P ≤ 0.016, and Cochran’s Q test compared within groups with significance at P ≤ 0.005, both adjusted using Bonferroni correction. The study was conducted with a 95% confidence level and an 80% statistical power.ResultsThe study had a 97.7% retention rate with all but one patient successfully completing the 18 month follow up period. Colour match was the only outcome that showed a statistically significant difference between the groups, with short glass fibre reinforced restorations displaying some colour discrepancies. Other outcomes such as marginal adaptation, marginal discoloration, recurrent caries and gross fracture showed no significant differences between groups. Age, gender and tooth distribution also showed no significant statistical differences.ConclusionsThe clinical performance of fibre-reinforced resin composite restorations are similar and comparable to nanohybrid composite restorations over an 18-month duration. Short glass fibre-reinforced restorations displayed variations in colour match, indicating that aesthetic outcomes should be carefully considered.",

    "abstract": "Parasitoid wasps are major causes of mortality of many species, making host immune defences a common target of adaptive evolution, though such targets outside model species are poorly understood. In this study, we used two tests of positive selection to compare across three closely relatedGalerucellaleaf beetles that show substantial differences in their phenotypic response to the shared parasitoid waspAsecodes parviclava, their main natural enemy. Using a codon-based test, which detects excess amino acid fixations per locus along each species’ lineage, we found more evidence of positive selection on parasitoid-relevant immune genes in the species with the strongest immunocompetence (G. pusilla) compared with the species having weaker immunocompetence (G. tenellaandG. calmariensis). Moreover, genes coding for the early phases in the immune response cascade were predominantly among the positively selected immune genes, providing targets for future functional genomic study to pin-point connections between genotypic and phenotypic differences in defences towards a parasitoid wasp. In contrast, genome-wide analyses of the haplotype frequency spectrum, which quantify selection over recent evolutionary time scales, revealed similar signatures of positive selection on immune genes across species. These results advance the field of host-parasitoid dynamics by providing novel insights into the tempo and mode of insect host evolutionary dynamics, and offering a framework for making genotype to phenotype connections for immunocompetence phenotypes.",

This study aimed to examine the association between BMI and the risk of elevated liver stiffness in older people.Methods2736 participants from the West China Health and Aging Cohort Study (WCHAC) were included in the present study. Liver stiffness was assessed using transient elastography (TE). The association of the 5-year average BMI level with elevated liver stiffness risk was estimated using multinomial logistic regression. The group-based trajectory model (GBTM) was applied to identify BMI trajectories. Additionally, restricted cubic spline analysis was conducted to explore the dose-response association between BMI and the risk of elevated liver stiffness.ResultsParticipants in the second BMI quartile (21.93–23.58) had the lowest prevalence of elevated liver stiffness, and then the risk increased with higher BMI quartiles (BMI Q4 vs. Q2, OR = 2.05, 95% CI: 1.37–3.11 and Q5 vs. Q2, OR = 2.82, 95% CI: 1.78–4.39). There were five BMI trajectories over the five-year period: low-normal-weight stable (7.42%), moderate-normal-weight stable (29.10%), low-level-overweight stable (36.22%), high-level-overweight stable (20.32%) and stable obesity (6.94%). Participants in the moderate-normal-weight stable group had the lowest prevalence of elevated liver stiffness. Compared with this group, the adjusted ORs (95% CI) elevated liver stiffness prevalence were 2.02 (1.39–2.97) for the high-level-overweight stable, and 2.83 (1.72–4.64) for the group of people with stable obesity. Dose-response analysis revealed a U-shaped relationship between BMI and elevated liver stiffness risk, suggesting an optimal BMI range of 21.8–24.3 kg/m² for older people to minimize elevated liver stiffness risk.ConclusionsOur study elucidated the U-shaped relationship between BMI and the risk of elevated liver stiffness as measured by TE, and the optimal BMI range from 21.8 to 24.3 kg/m2for the lowest risk of elevated liver stiffness in older people.",

This study aims to investigate the association between RFM and incident T2DM among adults in the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study cohort.MethodsData from 8419 participants (4716 women; mean age, 40.52 years) were analyzed. Logistic regression was used to assess the association of RFM with insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and its components at baseline. Cox proportional hazards models were applied to evaluate the association between RFM and incident T2DM. Wald tests were used to compare RFM hazard ratios (HRs) with those of BMI, WC, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) in the Cox model.ResultsOver a median follow-up of 14 years, 1382 individuals (16.42%) developed T2DM. RFM was significantly associated with insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and its components at baseline in both men and women. In the multivariable-adjusted model, each standard deviation increase in RFM was associated with a 1.26-fold (1.02–1.57,P= 0.037) higher risk of T2DM in men and a 1.52-fold (1.27–1.81,P< 0.001) higher risk in women. These associations were stronger in younger individuals and remained significant only in women after adjusting for insulin resistance and restricting the analysis to normoglycemic individuals. The increased T2DM risk associated with RFM was comparable to that associated with WC in both men and women (Pdifference> 0.05).ConclusionsWhile RFM is strongly associated with the risk of T2DM, particularly in women and younger individuals, it does not outperform WC.",

We hypothesized that B cell-derived LTαβ2would critically affect ileitis in TNFΔARE+/−mice. However, whereas deleting LTβ in B cells was essential for tertiary lymphoid tissue, disease pathology was minimally affected. By contrast, loss of B cell-derived LTα increased intestinal permeability, shrunk the pool of IgA+ileal plasma cells, elevated cytokines and prompted weight loss, including loss of muscle mass—a systemic feature of Crohn’s disease. Neutralizing antibodies to LTα3strongly augmented the cachexic-like effects of TNF. Thus, B cell-produced LTαβ2and LTα3have distinct roles in ileitis, with the role of LTα3unexpectedly protective through counterbalancing TNF.",

Here we present an encompassing study into the phase behaviour of 55 polymer:small-molecular acceptor blends, pivotal in determining device performance and stability. Many of these exhibit non-trivial behaviour, which cannot be understood by conventional mixing theory. Interestingly, the phase diagrams are subject to variations in glass transition temperature, strongly suggesting an important role of configurational entropy. We present an extended model for the mixing free energy, accounting for a temperature dependence of free volume and configurational freedom. The phase behaviour can be roughly categorized in terms of the ratio of the monomeric volumes of the individual components. The model qualitatively reproduces all experimental observations and poses a viable starting point for assisting development.",

Nonetheless, their translation into practical applications has been hindered by the slow kinetics and reversibility of Li plating and stripping on copper foils. Here we report a two-dimensional polyamide (2DPA)/lithiated Nafion (LN) interphase layer for anode-free Li metal batteries. Through molecular engineering, we construct a 2DPA layer with a large conjugated structure and Li-ion adsorption groups that show efficient adsorption, distribution and nucleation of Li ions. 2DPA molecules assembled into two-dimensional sheets are further incorporated with LN to create an ultrathin interphase layer with high-rate, high-capacity Li plating/stripping. These 2DPA/LN layers have higher rate capabilities and maximal energy and power densities compared with alternative polymer interphase layers, enabling the fabrication of an anode-free pouch cell with high performance. Overall, our interphase engineering approach is a promising tool to push the translation of anode-free Li metal batteries based on two-dimensional polymer interphase layers into practical devices, and enable the fabrication of energy storage technologies with high energy and power densities.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is standard of care in advanced diffuse pleural mesothelioma (DPM), but its role in the perioperative management of DPM is unclear. In tandem, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) ultra-sensitive residual disease detection has shown promise in providing a molecular readout of ICB efficacy across resectable cancers. This phase 2 trial investigated neoadjuvant nivolumab and nivolumab/ipilimumab in resectable DPM along with tumor-informed liquid biopsy residual disease assessments. Patients with resectable epithelioid/biphasic DPM enrolled sequentially to nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) for three cycles (Arm A,n= 16) or nivolumab 3 mg kg−1q2w for three cycles plus ipilimumab 1 mg kg−1on cycle 1 (Arm B,n= 14), followed by surgery, optional chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, and nivolumab 480 mg q4w for 1 year. Co-primary endpoints included safety and feasibility; key exploratory endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and ctDNA analyses. The trial met its primary endpoints, and, in Arms A and B, 81.3% and 85.7% of patients proceeded to surgery, respectively. Treatment was safe, with a single dose-limiting toxicity in each arm. In Arm A, median PFS and OS were 9.6 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.5–27.7) and 19.3 months (95% CI: 14.9–34.7), respectively. In Arm B, median PFS and OS were 19.8 months (7.1–not reached) and 28.6 months (20.4–not reached), respectively. Persistent ctDNA was detected during neoadjuvant therapy in patients who did not undergo complete surgical resection due to disease progression (Fisher’s exact test,P= 0.00013). Patients with detectable ctDNA on cycle 3 and pre-surgery had shorter PFS (log-rank test,P= 0.027 andP= 0.0059, respectively); this association was more pronounced when quantitative ctDNA changes were considered (log-rank test,P= 1.8 × 10−6). Our findings support the feasibility of neoadjuvant ICB and the clinical utility of ctDNA analyses to capture residual disease in resectable DPM. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:NCT03918252.",

    "abstract": "Risk of death for both mother and fetus following Ebola virus infection is extremely high. In this study, healthy women in Rwanda aged ≥18 years were randomized to two-dose Ebola vaccination (Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo) during pregnancy (group A) or postpartum (group B). Unvaccinated pregnant group B women served as control. This was a parallel, randomized, controlled, open-label, single-center trial to evaluate the safety (primary endpoint—outcomes of interest and serious adverse events (SAEs)) and immunogenicity (secondary endpoint) of the two-dose Ebola vaccination. Among 3,484 women screened, 2,013 were randomized, and 2,012 women and 1,945 infants born alive were descriptively analyzed. Adverse outcomes of interest occurred in women (5.2% in group A and 7.3% in group B) and infants (26.0% in group A and 25.6% in group B). The most common maternal outcome of interest was pathways to preterm birth (3.2% in group A and 3.4% in group B), and the most common infant outcome of interest was small for gestational age (14.3% in group A and 11.8% in group B). Maternal/fetal and neonatal/infant SAE frequencies were comparable between groups (9.8% in group A, 9.0% in group B and 21.9% in group A, 15.9% in group B, respectively). Anti-Ebola virus glycoprotein-specific binding antibody response (secondary endpoint) was sustained in ≥90% of women at 1 year postdose 1. In group A, binding antibodies were detected in cord blood (99%) and infant serum (95%) samples 14 weeks postbirth. The trial met all primary and secondary objectives. Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo did not raise concerns regarding adverse maternal/fetal or neonatal/infant outcomes, had no unexpected safety issues, and induced binding antibody responses in women and offspring through passive transfer.

    "abstract": "During recent decades, the incidence of several psychiatric disorders has increased, but no previous study has investigated whether the polygenic burden based on common variants for psychiatric disorders in diagnosed individuals has changed over time. Here we aimed to explore changes in polygenic scores for schizophrenia, depression, autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the general population and in case populations according to birth cohorts. The iPSYCH2015 is a Danish population-based case–cohort study, including individuals born between 1981 and 2008, who were followed for a psychiatric diagnosis between 1994 and 2015. We included 41,132 individuals from the random subcohort and 60,293 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, depression, autism or ADHD. We estimated changes in polygenic scores across birth years based on linear regression. The average polygenic score was stable in the random subcohort but decreased across birth years in case populations, most predominantly for schizophrenia (per 10 years: −0.13 s.d., 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.18 to −0.07) but also for depression (−0.06 s.d., 95% CI −0.10 to −0.03) and autism (−0.08 s.d., 95% CI −0.13 to −0.04) and to a limited degree for ADHD (−0.03 s.d., 95% CI −0.08 to 0.02). Moreover, we estimated how the hazard ratio for being diagnosed given a 1 s.d. increase in polygenic score changed according to birth year, which decreased for schizophrenia but remained stable for the other disorders. Finally, we estimated the number of additional cases per 1 s.d. increase in polygenic score according to birth year, which decreased for both schizophrenia and depression, whereas autism and ADHD showed increases. In conclusion, the polygenic burden for psychiatric disorders changed across two decades among diagnosed individuals in Denmark. For schizophrenia, the polygenic score itself and its predictive ability decreased over time, whereas depression, autism and ADHD showed diverse changes.",

    "abstract": "Depressive and anxiety disorders are characterized by altered connectivity within and between the default mode network (DMN) and salience network. Basal forebrain subdivisions, critical for regulating network activity, remain understudied across these conditions. To address this gap, we analyzed 7-Tesla resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a transdiagnostic sample (n= 70), primarily with depressive and anxiety disorders, and healthy controls (n= 77). We used spectral dynamic causal modeling to assess effective connectivity between the medial septum/diagonal band (Ch1–3), nucleus basalis of Meynert (Ch4), ventral pallidum, and DMN and salience network. Healthy participants showed excitatory connectivity from Ch1–3 to the DMN and from Ch4 to the anterior insula. By contrast, clinical participants exhibited greater inhibitory Ch4 to DMN connectivity and increased excitatory connectivity from Ch4 to the anterior insula. Widespread Ch4 connectivity dysfunction may implicate the cholinergic system as a mechanistic and therapeutic target for depressive and anxiety disorders.",

    "title": "An alternative route for β-hydroxybutyrate metabolism supports cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthesis in cancer cells",
    "abstract": "Cancer cells are exposed to diverse metabolites in the tumour microenvironment that are used to support the synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids and lipids needed for rapid cell proliferation. In some tumours, ketone bodies such as β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB), which are elevated in circulation under fasting conditions or low glycemic diets, can serve as an alternative fuel that is metabolized in the mitochondria to provide acetyl-CoA for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Here we identify a non-canonical route for β-OHB metabolism that bypasses the TCA cycle to generate cytosolic acetyl-CoA. We show that in cancer cells that can metabolize ketones, β-OHB-derived acetoacetate in the mitochondria can be shunted into the cytosol, where acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (AACS) and thiolase convert it into cytosolic acetyl-CoA. This alternative metabolic routing allows β-OHB to avoid oxidation in the mitochondria and to be used as a major source of cytosolic acetyl-CoA, even when other key cytosolic acetyl-CoA precursors such as glucose are available in excess. Finally, we demonstrate that ketone body metabolism, including this alternative AACS-dependent route, can support the growth of mouseKrasG12D;Trp53−/−pancreatic tumours grown orthotopically in the pancreas of male mice, as well as the growth of mouse B16 melanoma tumours in male mice fed a calorie-restricted diet. Together, these data reveal how cancer cells use β-OHB as a major source of cytosolic acetyl-CoA to support cell proliferation and tumour growth.",

    "abstract": "Concurrent recording of electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals reveals cross-scale neurovascular dynamics crucial for explaining fundamental linkages between function and behaviors. However, MRI scanners generate artifacts for EEG detection. Despite existing denoising methods, cabled connections to EEG receivers are susceptible to environmental fluctuations inside MRI scanners, creating baseline drifts that complicate EEG signal retrieval from the noisy background. Here we show that a wireless integrated sensing detector for simultaneous EEG and MRI can encode fMRI and EEG signals on distinct sidebands of the detector’s oscillation wave for detection by a standard MRI console over the entire duration of the fMRI sequence. Local field potential and fMRI maps are retrieved through low-pass and high-pass filtering of frequency-demodulated signals. From optogenetically stimulated somatosensory cortex in ChR2-transfected Sprague Dawley rats, positive correlation between evoked local field potential and fMRI signals validates strong neurovascular coupling, enabling cross-scale brain mapping with this two-in-one transducer.",

    "abstract": "Viral infections are implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, including Sjögren’s disease (SjD), but the mechanisms linking viral antigens to disease development remain poorly understood. To address this, we conducted shotgun metagenomic sequencing of saliva samples from 35 patients with SjD and 25 healthy controls. The salivary virome of the patients with SjD, particularly those with high disease activity, had an expansion ofSiphoviridaebacteriophages and increased eukaryotic viral sequences, including Vientovirus. This virus was associated with lacrimal gland dysfunction and elevated anti-SSA/Ro52 autoantibody levels. Alignment analysis and cross-blocking assay identified molecular mimicry between the Vientovirus capsid protein and the autoantigen SSA/Ro52. Mice immunized with a Vientovirus capsid peptide developed anti-SSA/Ro52 antibodies and showed immunological features resembling those of patients with SjD. These findings highlight distinct virome profiles in SjD and provide mechanistic evidence supporting the role of Vientovirus in triggering autoimmunity through molecular mimicry.",

Here we analysed decade-long field measurements using continuous-flow cytometry from our SeaFlow instrument, collecting per-cell chlorophyll fluorescence and size data for ~800 billion phytoplankton cells across the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean to quantify the temperature dependence of cell division.Prochlorococcusdivision rates appear primarily determined by temperature, increasing exponentially to 28 °C, then sharply declining. Regional surface water temperatures may exceed this range by the end of the century under both moderate and high warming scenarios. Under these future conditions, our global ocean ecosystem model suggests a possible 17–51% reduction inProchlorococcusproduction in tropical oceans. Even with the inclusion of hypothetical warm-adapted strains, models show significant production declines in the warmest regions, suggesting that thermal adaptation may not prevent negative impacts.

    "abstract": "Restriction-modification (R-M) systems protect against phage infection by detecting and degrading invading foreign DNA. However, like many prokaryotic anti-phage defences, R-M systems pose a major risk of autoimmunity, exacerbated by the presence of hundreds to thousands of potential cleavage sites in the bacterial genome.Pseudomonas aeruginosastrains experience the temporary inactivation of restriction endonucleases following growth at high temperatures, but the reason and mechanisms for this phenomenon are unknown. Here we report thatP. aeruginosatype I restriction endonuclease is degraded and the methyltransferase is partially degraded, by two Lon-like proteases when replicating at >41 °C. This post-translational regulation prevents self-DNA targeting, which is a risk due to stable genomic hypomethylation, as demonstrated by single-molecule, real-time sequencing and TadA-assistedN6-methyladenosine sequencing. When cells grown at >41 °C are returned to 37 °C, full genomic methylation does not fully recover for up to 60 bacterial generations, and thus restriction activity remains off for the duration. Our findings demonstrate that type I R-M is tightly regulated post-translationally with a long memory effect that ensures genomic stability and mitigates autotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "Micro- and nanoplastic particles are ubiquitous environmental pollutants, threatening human health, aquatic and soil ecosystems. These minute synthetic fragments, persisting for centuries, infiltrate the food chain, posing potential health risks through bioaccumulation in various tissues, toxicity and exposure to associated chemicals. Although macro- and microplastics are intensively examined in environmental and biological research, information on nanoplastics with diameters below 1 μm is limited. Such particles can cross biological borders, including the blood–brain barrier, posing a greater health risk than microplastics. Apart from the mere detection of such particles, gaining an understanding of size distribution, numbers and size limits will be crucial in assessing their impact on global ecosystems and human health. Here we establish an optical sieve that uses Mie void resonances for nanoplastic detection and sizing. The optical sieve consists of arrays of optically resonant voids with different diameters that simultaneously serve as filtering and sorting elements, as well as all-optical reporters, requiring only an optical microscope and a standard camera with an RGB sensor in combination with colorimetric analysis. The system is evaluated using a synthesized real-world sample with a plastic particle mass concentration of 150 μg ml−1. Our approach consequently delivers statistical information on numbers, size and size distribution via the observation of distinct colour changes, overcoming the need for advanced techniques such as scanning electron microscopy. The proposed method offers a straightforward, highly accessible and mobile solution, making it an efficient and easily implemented tool for environmental and biological research.",

However, standard approaches are poorly suited to live-cell imaging owing to the need to separate light into many spectral channels, and unmixing algorithms struggle with low signal-to-noise ratio data. Here we introduce an approach for multispectral imaging in live cells that comprises an iterative spectral unmixing algorithm and eight-channel camera-based image-acquisition hardware. This enables the accurate unmixing of low signal-to-noise ratio datasets captured at video rates, while maintaining diffraction-limited spatial resolution. We use this approach on a commercial spinning-disk confocal microscope and a home-built oblique-plane light-sheet microscope to image one to seven spectrally distinct fluorophore species simultaneously, using both fluorescent protein fusions and small-molecule dyes. We further develop protein-binding proteins (minibinders), labelled with organic fluorophores, and use these in combination with our multispectral imaging approach to study the endosomal trafficking of cell-surface receptors at endogenous levels.",

    "abstract": "Certifying that ann-qubit state synthesized in the laboratory is close to a given target state is a fundamental task in quantum information science. However, existing rigorous protocols applicable to general target states have potentially prohibitive resource requirements in the form of either deep quantum circuits or exponentially many single-qubit measurements. Here we prove that almost alln-qubit target states, including those with exponential circuit complexity, can be certified from onlyO(n2) single-qubit measurements. Given access to the target state’s amplitudes, our protocol requires onlyO(n3) classical computation. This result is established by a technique that relates certification to the mixing time of a random walk. Our protocol has applications for benchmarking quantum systems, for optimizing quantum circuits to generate a desired target state and for learning and verifying neural networks, tensor networks and various other representations of quantum states using only single-qubit measurements. We show that such verified representations can be used to efficiently predict highly non-local properties of a synthesized state that would otherwise require an exponential number of measurements on the state. We demonstrate these applications in numerical experiments with up to 120 qubits and observe an advantage over existing methods such as cross-entropy benchmarking.",

    "abstract": "Increasing leaf area and extending vegetation growing seasons are two primary drivers of global greening, which has emerged as one of the most significant responses to climate change. However, it remains unclear how these two leaf acclimation strategies would vary across forests at a large spatial scale. Here, using multiple satellite-based datasets and field measurements, we analysed the temporal changes (Δ) in maximal leaf area index (LAImax) and length of the growing season (LOS) from 2002 to 2021 across deciduous broadleaf forests (DBFs) in the middle to high latitudes. Contrary to the widely held assumption of coordination, our results revealed a negative correlation between ΔLAImaxand ΔLOS. Notably, the trade-offs between ΔLAImaxand ΔLOS were strongly explained by stand age. Younger DBFs, with lower baseline LAImax, predominantly located in eastern Asia, displayed an increase in LAImaxwith small changes in LOS. This acquisitive strategy facilitated younger DBFs to grow more photosynthetically efficient leaves with low leaf mass per area, enhancing their light use efficiency. Conversely, older DBFs with a higher baseline LAImax, primarily located in North America and Europe, extended their LOS by increasing leaf mass per area. This conservative strategy facilitated older DBFs to produce thicker, but less photosynthetically efficient leaves, resulting in decreased light use efficiency. Our findings offer new insights into the contrasting changes in leaf area and growing season length and highlight their divergent impacts on ecosystem functioning.",

Global Natural Products Social Networking (GNPS) is a community-driven infrastructure for mass spectrometry data analysis, storage and knowledge dissemination. GNPS2 is an improved version of the platform offering higher processing speeds, improved data analysis tools and a more intuitive user interface. Molecular networking based on tandem mass spectrometry spectral alignments, combined with other tools in the GNPS2 analysis environment, enables the discovery of candidate drug metabolites without prior knowledge, even from complex biological matrices. This protocol represents an extension of a previously established protocol for fundamental molecular networking in GNPS, with a specific focus on metabolism studies. This article uses the example of the drug sildenafil to identify candidate metabolites obtained from liquid chromatography–quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of liver microsomal fractions and mice plasma to guide the reader through a step-by-step process consisting of five GNPS2-based analytical workflows. It demonstrates how the tools in GNPS2 can be used not only to identify candidate drug metabolites from in vitro studies but also to evaluate the translational relevance of these in vitro findings to humans by using reverse metabolomics. We provide a step-by-step analytical approach based on published studies to showcase how GNPS2 can be effectively applied in drug metabolism studies.",

Most companies focus narrowly on energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, with limited attention to more ocean-specific impacts, for which fewer than 25% of firms have metrics and targets. Where measurements are reported, the use of 443 distinct indicators limits comparability and suggests a lack of consensus on what should be disclosed. Amid growing demands for corporate accountability, our findings provide a timely benchmark to support the integration of ocean-specific considerations into reporting frameworks and to guide materiality assessments that better reflect the environmental realities of the ocean economy.",

    "title": "Older and wiser? The neural correlates of worry induction and reappraisal in older adults",
    "abstract": "Severe worry is a transdiagnostic, highly prevalent symptom, difficult to treat and associated with significant morbidity in late life. Understanding the neural correlates of worry induction and reappraisal in older adults is key to developing novel treatments. We recruited 124 older adults ( ≥ 50 years old) with varying worry severity and clinical comorbidity (27% generalized anxiety disorder, 23% depressive disorders). Participants completed a naturalistic worry induction and reappraisal task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and they rated worry severity after each condition. We compared conditions using voxel-wise paired t-tests and conducted k-means clustering on regional activation to identify groups. We predicted the clinical features of cluster groupings using elastic net regression. Worry induction activated regions in default mode network, executive control network, anterior salience network, visual cortex, and subcortical regions (including basal ganglia and thalamus). Reappraisal was characterized by a broader activation of the cingulate and prefrontal cortex. Activity during worry induction clustered into a largely hyperactive compared to a largely hypoactive group. We accurately predicted clusters using elastic net regression and found the hypoactive group exhibited higher reflection, lower in-scanner worry, and greater cumulative illness compared to hyperactive group. We expand our previous work on neural correlates of worry induction and reappraisal, and we identify two novel neuro-endophenotypes: one with neural hyperactivation and high acute worry and another with relatively lower worry, higher reflection and neural hypoactivation. These results identify potential target networks in chronic severe worriers that may be amenable to neuromodulation. “By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; Second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest.” -Confucius",

    "title": "Chronic treatment with fluoxetine regulates mitochondrial features and plasticity-associated transcriptomic pathways in parvalbumin-positive interneurons of prefrontal cortex",
    "abstract": "Chronic treatment with fluoxetine, a widely prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is known to promote neural plasticity. The role of fluoxetine in plasticity has been particularly tied to parvalbumin-positive interneurons, a key population of GABAergic neurons that regulate inhibitory tone and network stability. While our previous studies have highlighted fluoxetine-induced plasticity in the visual cortex and hippocampus, its cell-type-specific effects in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the effects of chronic fluoxetine treatment on PV-positive (PV+) cells, identified using PV-IRES-Cre-driven reporter expression in the PFC. Using Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP), we found that fluoxetine treatment altered the expression of 50 distinct biological pathways. Downregulated pathways are involved in mitochondrial ATP production, including components of the electron transport chain, and ribosomes. Upregulated pathways were associated with phosphatase activity, ion channel function, and cytoskeletal remodeling —molecules broadly implicated in synaptic signaling and plasticity-related processes. In FACS-sorted cells, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) expression was significantly increased in PV+cells of the PFC, while intracellular ATP levels remained unchanged. Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated reduced PV expression and weakened perineuronal nets in specific PFC subregions, suggesting a plasticity-permissive state in PV+cells. TOMM22 signal intensity in PV+cells showed a slight but significant increase in the prelimbic region, suggesting potential compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis despite transcriptomic downregulation of mitochondrial genes. Our findings reveal that chronic fluoxetine induces coordinated transcriptional, structural alterations in PV+cells of the PFC, including shifts in mitochondrial-related gene expression and plasticity-associated pathways. These changes may contribute to region-specific shifts in cortical inhibition and plasticity, complementing previous reports of fluoxetine-mediated behavioral modulation.",

    "abstract": "Forkhead-box-protein P3 (FOXP3) is a key transcription factor in T regulatory cells (Tregs). However, its expression and significance in non-immune stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated FOXP3 expression in stromal fibroblasts of mouse and human gastrointestinal tumors. Immunohistological examination revealed FOXP3 expression in αSMA+collagen I+myofibroblasts. In the mouse omentum inoculated with gastric cancer cells, cytokeratin(−)/CD45(−)/FoxP3(+)stromal cells were identified via flow-cytometry, and high FOXP3 expression was noted in fibroblasts surrounding the tumor glands, where CD8+T cells were exclusively infiltrated. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) from mouse gastric cancer cells upregulated Foxp3 transcription in fibroblasts, which partly depends on increase of transcription factors including NFAT1 and c-Rel, and activation of TGF-β and STAT5 pathways. In FOXP3(+)fibroblasts, immunosuppressive cytokines including IL-10 and CCL2 were upregulated. FOXP3 overexpression in NIH/3T3 fibroblasts enhanced Wnt3a-induced β-catenin responses, accompanied by cell growth and tumor invasion in mice stomach. As the mechanism, FOXP3 induced CDH11 expression in fibroblasts, which augmented the Wnt3/β-catenin pathway, and blocking of CDH11 suppressed tumor invasion mediated by FOXP3(+)fibroblasts. Our results suggest that cancer cell-derived EVs regulate FOXP3 expression in stromal fibroblasts, attenuating antitumor immunity, and facilitating tumor invasion.",

    "title": "Tumor antigen PRAME promotes melanoma growth by inactivating p53 through the SIRT1-DBC1 axis",
    "abstract": "Preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma (PRAME), which is highly expressed in melanoma, is associated with tumor progression and malignancy. Notably, melanoma cells often exhibit inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53 despite carrying the wild-type p53 gene. Here, we investigated the functional interplay between PRAME and p53. Consistent with our analysis of human databases, PRAME overexpression promoted melanoma cell proliferation. Conversely, PRAME downregulation produced the opposite effects, accompanied by an increase in apoptosis. RNA sequencing revealed aberrant regulation of p53 target genes following PRAME depletion, which was further supported by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and luciferase reporter assays. To explore the underlying mechanism, we isolated the PRAME protein complex and identified DBC1, an SIRT1 suppressor, as a component of the complex. Furthermore, we observed that PRAME promoted p53 deacetylation. The interaction of PRAME with DBC1 releases SIRT1 from DBC1, enabling SIRT1 activation and subsequent p53 deacetylation. The combination of PRAME depletion and SIRT1 inhibition can significantly promote the growth retardation of melanoma cells, as demonstrated by xenograft analysis in nude mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that the acquired elevation of the PRAME level during melanoma pathogenesis may suppress p53 pathways, thereby promoting tumor growth. We propose that PRAME silencing combined with the use of SIRT1 inhibitors is a promising therapeutic strategy for melanoma by restoring p53 activity.",

Included cohorts had data on albuminuria [urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR)], estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), overall and site-specific cancer incidence, and established risk factors for cancer. Included participants were aged 18 years or older, without previous cancer or kidney failure.ResultsAmong 1,319,308 individuals, the incidence rate of overall cancer was 17.3 per 1000 person-years. Higher ACR was positively associated with cancer risk [adjusted hazard ratio 1.08 (95% CI 1.06–1.10) per 8-fold increase in ACR]. No association of eGFR with overall cancer risk was seen. For site-specific cancers, lower eGFR was associated with urological cancer and multiple myeloma, whereas higher ACR was associated with many cancer types (kidney, head/neck, colorectal, liver, pancreas, bile duct, stomach, larynx, lung, hemolymphatic, leukaemia, and multiple myeloma). Results were similar in a 1-year landmark analysis.DiscussionAlbuminuria, but not necessarily eGFR, was independently associated with the subsequent risk of cancer.

    "abstract": "Tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) is a common oral malignancy prone to metastasis, whose underlying mechanism remains obscure. Here, we report the oncogenic roles of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) in TSCC via inhibiting transcription factor ΔNp63α. We found that PRMT5 physically interacts with ΔNp63α, resulting in impairment of ΔNp63α-mediated transcriptional regulation. Further investigation revealed that PRMT5 is significantly upregulated in late stages of TSCC and correlated to poor prognosis. On the other hand, inhibition on ΔNp63α contributes to PRMT5-induced migration and metastasis of TSCC cells. Mechanistically, PRMT5 mediates methylation of ΔNp63α at Arg561, which facilitates CDK1-mediated phosphorylation of ΔNp63α and results in weakened DNA binding of this transcription factor. Consequently, ΔNp63α-mediated suppression on cell migration is attenuated in TSCC. Inhibition of PRMT5 efficiently restrain metastasis of TSCC cells in vivo. Our study is helpful to illuminate the molecular mechanism of TSCC metastasis and to provide a new therapeutic strategy for this malignancy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDiabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of preventable blindness. Although hyperglycaemia is the primary driver, other modifiable risk factors may contribute to DR development. This study investigated the association between haemoglobin levels and DR risk in adults with type 2 diabetes.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX network (2010–2022). Adults aged ≥45 years with type 2 diabetes were divided into low haemoglobin (LHB, 8–12 g/dL) and control (≥12 g/dL) groups. Propensity score matching was used to address potential confounders. The primary outcome was new-onset DR occurring 6–36 months after the index date. The secondary outcomes included DR subtypes and diabetic ophthalmic complications. Subgroup analyses examined effect modifications by hypertension status, glycaemic control, and sex.ResultsAfter propensity score matching (28,882 patients per group), patients in the LHB group showed significantly higher risk of overall DR (HR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.24–1.44), proliferative DR (HR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.62–2.35), and non-proliferative DR (HR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.06–1.33). Even mild haemoglobin reductions (10–12 g/dL) were associated with increased DR risk. The association was stronger in patients without hypertension (HR: 1.58 vs 1.21), remained consistent regardless of HbA1c levels, and was more pronounced in males than females.ConclusionLow haemoglobin levels independently increased the risk of DR in adults with type 2 diabetes, with the strongest association for proliferative DR. Routine haemoglobin monitoring and maintenance of optimal levels may represent a modifiable risk factor for DR prevention along with glycaemic control and blood pressure management.",

    "title": "Low-carbon technology investment strategies with blockchain under subsidy policies",
    "abstract": "Driven by government-led digital transformation initiatives and the rapid development of blockchain technology, low-carbon supply chain management is increasingly confronted with the dual imperative of investing in low-carbon technologies while effectively integrating blockchain systems to maximise corporate profits. This study examines low-carbon product supply chains by assessing the impact of government subsidy policies on manufacturers’ investment decisions in low-carbon technology, particularly in the context of blockchain adoption. Using a game-theoretic framework, four distinct supply chain models are developed to reflect scenarios with and without blockchain adoption and to compare the effects of technology-oriented and output-based subsidy policies. The findings suggest that larger subsidies encourage greater investment in low-carbon technologies, with higher total subsidy amounts having a stronger incentive effect. Notably, in the absence of blockchain technology, technology subsidy policies result in higher product pricing. However, when blockchain is introduced, manufacturers strategically increase wholesale prices to capture a greater share of the subsidy benefits, with the extent of the price adjustment depending on the subsidy amount. To effectively stimulate consumer purchases, policymakers should carefully consider the implications of implementing technology subsidies in markets lacking blockchain infrastructure. In addition, strengthening consumer trust in green products motivates manufacturers to intensify their efforts to reduce emissions, leading to higher wholesale and retail prices without dampening demand. These findings highlight the crucial roles of both subsidy mechanisms and blockchain technology in developing efficient low-carbon supply chain strategies. This study also introduces a unified analytical framework that defines the boundaries of low-carbon technology investments across various policy and technological scenarios, offering valuable insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers.",

This study aimed to compare sexual satisfaction and complication rates in patients undergoing feminizing gender affirming surgery (fem-GAS) using two techniques: standard penile inversion vaginoplasty (PIV) and robotic peritoneal vaginoplasty (RPGAV). We conducted a retrospective analysis data from a prospective registry (2017–2022). All patients had at least two years of hormone therapy. Sexual satisfaction was evaluated one year postoperatively using a custom Likert scale-based questionnaire developed in collaboration with our psychosexologist. We also performed a non-systematic review of the literature on sexual outcomes following LPGAV and RPGAV. We included 19 patients (PIV = 11; RPGAV = 8). Median age at surgery was 32 years. No significant differences were observed between groups regarding preoperative characteristics or complication rates. One Clavien-Dindo grade >3b complication occurred in RPGAV group. Compared to the PIV group, patients in the RPGAV group reported significantly (p = 0.04) higher improvement in “quality of sexual intercourse” (87.5 vs. 27.3%) and “overall sexual satisfaction” (87.5 vs. 27.3%). No significant differences were found in orgasm quality, speed, or erogenous sensitivity. Although literature data on sexual outcomes remain limited, RPGAV may provide better satisfaction, particularly regarding vaginal width, depth, and lubrication, with similar complication rates. Although our study is limited by its small sample size and retrospective design, it represents the first direct comparison between these techniques. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

SEP-specific intervention costs and effects at age 5 years were derived from the trial data and applied to a cohort of 4- to 5-year-old Australian children. We used the validated EQ-EPOCH microsimulation model to predict SEP-specific body mass index (BMI) trajectories, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and health care costs until 17 years of age. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and acceptability curves were derived for each SEP group, using 2023 Australian dollars (AUD).ResultsFrom an Australian health payer perspective, the ICERs for the low-SEP group were $131 per BMI unit avoided and $6549 per QALY gained, compared to the high-SEP group at $1161 per BMI unit avoided and $41,462 per QALY gained. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses varying the intervention effect size, intervention costs, healthcare costs, discount rate and disutility from overweight. The probability that the intervention was cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained was extremely high in the low-SEP group (99.7%) and marginally cost-effective in the high-SEP group (49.6%).ConclusionsA telephone and SMS intervention was more cost-effective in low-SEP groups compared with high-SEP groups.

    "abstract": "Excessive alcohol use causes a great deal of harm and negative health outcomes. Corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF), a stress-related neuropeptide, has been implicated in binge ethanol intake and ethanol dependence in rodents. CRF containing neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTCRF) can influence ethanol consumption. These BNSTCRFneurons also release GABA, raising the question, is it CRF release, GABA release, or both that is regulating alcohol consumption. Here, we used viral vectors to separate the effects of CRF and GABA release from BNSTCRFneurons on the escalation of ethanol intake in an operant self-administration procedure in male and female mice. We found that CRF deletion in BNST neurons reduces ethanol intake in both sexes, with a stronger effect in males. For sucrose self-administration there was no effect of CRF deletion. Suppression of GABA release, via knockdown of vGAT, from BNSTCRFproduced a transient increase in ethanol operant self-administration in male mice, and reduced motivation to work for sucrose on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement in a sex-dependent manner. Together, these results highlight how different signaling molecules from the same populations of neurons can bidirectionally control behavior. Moreover, they suggest that BNST CRF release is important for high intensity ethanol drinking that precedes dependence, whereas GABA release from these neurons may play a role in regulating motivation.",

    "abstract": "It has become evident from decades of clinical trials that multimodal therapeutic approaches with focus on cell intrinsic and microenvironmental cues are needed to improve understanding and treat the rare, inoperable, and ultimately fatal diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), now categorized as a diffuse midline glioma. In this study we report the development and characterization of an in vitro system utilizing 3D Tumor Tissue Analogs (TTA), designed to replicate the intricate DIPG microenvironment. The innate ability of fluorescently labeled human brain endothelial cells, microglia, and patient-derived DIPG cell lines to self-assemble has been exploited to generate multicellular 3D TTAs that mimic tissue-like microstructures, enabling an in- depth exploration of the spatio-temporal dynamics between neoplastic and stromal cells. The 3D-TTA model recapitulates clinical patterns of DIPG growth, evidenced by resistance to chemotherapy, HDAC and proteasome inhibitors, as well as sensitization to the antibody-activated innate immune microenvironment including complement proteins and surrounding microglia. Multimodal fluorescence imaging platforms integrated with high-throughput omics revealed that alterations in tumor cell motility and growth in the 3D-TTA model compared to tumor cell only spheroids correlated with specific transcriptomic and proteomic changes. STAT3, ITGA5, LGALS1, SOD2, MVP, and CLIC1, associated with microenvironment signaling, DNA replication, and immune regulation, were identified as potential novel targets in the 3D model. The results indicate that the 3D TTA platform developed here represents a powerful tool for preclinical studies, paving the way for identification/validation of tissue specific biomarkers and novel drug targets, thus advancing disease management strategies for DIPG in children.",

    "title": "Targeting FSP1 to induce ferroptosis in chromophobe renal cell carcinoma",
    "abstract": "There are no proven therapies for metastatic or unresectable Chromophobe Renal Cell Carcinoma (ChRCC). ChRCC is characterized by high glutathione levels and hypersensitivity to ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death characterized by peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The underlying mechanisms leading to ferroptosis hypersensitivity are unknown. Ferroptosis suppressor protein (FSP1) is a glutathione-independent suppressor of ferroptosis whose role in ChRCC is unexplored. In The Cancer Genomic Atlas (TCGA), we find that ChRCC exhibits the second highest upregulation ofFSP1relative to healthy organ out of all cancers, and that higherFSP1expression correlates with poorer patient outcomes. We also define a ferroptosis signature combiningFSP1and Solute Carrier Family 7 Member 11 (SLC7A11) that predicts patient survival across all TCGA tumor types. Data queried from the Dependency Map and the Cancer Target Discovery and Development indicate that highFSP1expression correlates with resistance to cell death induced by disruption of glutathione homeostasis via inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) or SLC7A11. Studies using ChRCC cell lines in vitro reveal that genetic inhibition of GPX4 or FSP1 individually does not induce substantial cell death, while inhibition of both results in near-complete loss of viability. Consistent with these genetic data, combining pharmacologic inhibition of GPX4 or SLC7A11 with inhibition of FSP1 demonstrates synergistic loss of viability. Strikingly, inhibition of FSP1 alone in vivo is sufficient to decrease ChRCC tumor growth by 69%, consistent with recent studies in lung and colorectal cancer showing similar effects. Taken together, these data establish FSP1 as targetable vulnerability in ChRCC.",

The pooled ORR and CRR of induction chemoimmunotherapy were 92.7% (95% CI: 90.7–94.7%) and 24.3% (95% CI: 15.2–33.6%), respectively. There was no significant difference of TRAEs between induction chemotherapy group and induction chemoimmunotherapy group (OR = 1.13; 95% CI: 0.92–1.39,P= 0.23).ConclusionsInduction chemoimmunotherapy could be a promising induction treatment option for LA-NPC patients, improving ORR and CRR with an acceptable safety profile. However, due to limitations in this meta-analysis, further large-scale, well-designed clinical trials are required to validate these results and optimise treatment strategies.",

    "title": "Recommendations for studying the association of the cancer diagnosis to treatment interval with overall survival: a modified Delphi process",
    "abstract": "BackgroundThe duration from diagnosis to primary treatment initiation (DTI) is an important interval for patients with cancer, as delayed treatment has been found to be associated with heightened recurrence rates and worsened survival. Studying the association between DTI duration and overall survival (OS) is biased and confounded by clinical triaging, heterogeneous definitions, and variation in analytic approaches.ObjectiveTo develop consensus-based guidance for conducting studies investigating the association of DTI duration and OS.MethodsA multidisciplinary panel was recruited to participate in a three-round modified Delphi approach to develop consensus recommendations on the best methodological practices when studying the association between DTI duration and OS.ResultsThe Delphi panel consisted of 15 experts in the fields of epidemiology, biostatistics, health services research, oncology, and health policy. A list of 24 recommendations with accompanying elaborations was generated including variable definition and measurement, cohort creation, confounder control, pertinent biases, analytic techniques, and balanced interpretation of results.ConclusionProviding valid evidence of the DTI effect on OS requires careful approaches. This paper offers recommendations on how to improve methodological quality. This will ensure that future studies effectively contribute to evidence-informed practice decisions on appropriate waiting times for patients with cancer.",

    "abstract": "Background:In recent years, there has been a steady increase in professionals engaged in radioactive work. The biological impacts of long-term exposure to low dose-rate radiation remain elusive, as there is a dearth of systematic research in this field.Methods:BEAS-2B cells were used to establish a cell model with continuous passaging after radiation exposure, which was subsequently subjected to in vivo tumorigenesis assays and in vitro malignant phenotype experiments. By scRNA-seq, we conducted copy number variation analysis, cell trajectory analysis, and cell communication analysis. Furthermore, we used FACS, molecular docking, multiplex immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR, and co-immunoprecipitation to validate and further explore the molecular mechanisms driving tumor evolution.Results:Long-term low dose-rate exposure is associated with a higher degree of malignancy, as evidenced by the induction of more CNV and EMT events, as well as the delayed activation of DNA repair pathways, which trigger increased genomic instability. The long-term low dose-rate specific ligand-receptor pair, ANGPTL4-SDC4, enhances cell malignancy by promoting angiogenesis in newly formed lung tumor cells.Conclusions:This study not only provides the first evidence and mechanistic explanation that long-term low dose-rate radiation leads to increased cellular malignancy but also offers valuable theoretical insights into the dynamic processes of early tumor evolution in lung cancer within the realm of tumor biology.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the most common cancer and one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the world, however, the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still limited, and it is a clinically urgent problem. ROBO1 is an important surface receptor on tumor cells, but the role of humanized chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified natural killer (NK) cells targeting ROBO1 in NSCLC is rarely explored. Furthermore, the role of PD-1 in NK cell killing tumor cells remains controversial. In this study, we identified the expression pattern of ROBO1 in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) by searching biological information databases. We constructed hROBO1-CAR-NK-92 cells and performed functional identification.We inserted the hROBO1-CAR at the PD-1 locus and performed functional detection in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that ROBO1 expression was significantly increased in LUSC. After inserting the hROBO1-CAR sequence at the PD-1 locus, the PD-1-KO-hROBO1-CAR-NK-92 cells had the best long-term killing ability and cytokine secretion ability, and had a significant inhibitory effect on tumor growth in the mouse xenograft model. We also observed that the long-term killing ability of PD-1-KO-hROBO1-CAR-NK-92 cells was achieved by inhibiting cell senescence via knocking out PD-1. These studies proposed ROBO1 as a key target for CAR-NK therapy in NSCLC and integrated hROBO1 CAR in PD-1 locus in NK cells, resulting in synergistic tumor killing effects in NSCLC, presenting a new treatment strategy for solid tumor treatment.",

    "title": "Osteocalcin has many tricks to get γ-carboxylated",
    "abstract": "Osteocalcin is a bone-derived hormone whose bioactivity is regulated by vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylation. Using cryo-electron microscopy, Cao et al. elucidate the structure of the osteocalcin precursor bound to the vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylase, revealing unique and complex interactions between the enzyme and its substrate. γ-carboxylation of glutamic acid (Glu) residues is a post-translational modification catalyzed by the vitamin K-dependent γ-carboxylase (VKGC or GGCX). This enzyme is localized within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and uses vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2) as a co-factor. KH2is epoxidated by the γ-carboxylase, a process that generates a superbase that deprotonates the γ-carbon of a Glu residue, allowing the addition of the carboxyl group.1γ-carboxylated residues (Gla), which increase the calcium ion (Ca2+) affinity of proteins, are present in several clotting factors (e.g., prothrombin, factor IX, factor X, etc.), explaining the essential role of vitamin K in blood coagulation. This modification is also found in matrix Gla protein (MGP), an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein that prevents calcification of arteries and cartilage,2and in GAS6, a signaling molecule implicated in immunity, cancer and diabetes.3Osteocalcin, also called bone Gla protein (BGP), is another small vitamin K-dependent protein produced specifically by osteoblasts and containing three Glu residues that can be γ-carboxylated.4The γ-carboxylated form of osteocalcin (cOCN) accumulates in the bone ECM due to its high affinity for hydroxyapatite, the mineral component of bone. As the most abundant non-collagenous protein of bone ECM, cOCN may play a role in the proper maturation of bone mineral.5When uncarboxylated or undercarboxylated, osteocalcin is released in the circulation and functions as a hormone to promote insulin sensitivity, enhance male fertility, and influence brain functions.4 Vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors such as factor IX are recognized by the γ-carboxylase through a conserved sequence (i.e.,FX5AX3L) contained in their propeptide region. The tight interaction with this propeptide sequence is also essential to stimulate γ-carboxylase and epoxidase enzymatic activity, allowing the sequential carboxylation of multiple Glu residues within a single substrate.6In contrast to the other Gla proteins, osteocalcin propeptide (i.e.,FX5GX3V), which does not match the conserved recognition sequence, binds weakly to the γ-carboxylase and does not activate γ-carboxylase.7Moreover, it was found that decarboxylated osteocalcin can be γ-carboxylated in vitro by the γ-carboxylase in the absence of its propeptide,8suggesting that osteocalcin is recognized through different and unknown molecular interface(s). A study by Cao et al.9published inCell Researchprovides important insights into the mechanism by which the osteocalcin precursor interacts with and activates γ-carboxylase. Using an ingenious approach, they expressed in mammalian cells pro-osteocalcin in fusion with the γ-carboxylase, allowing equimolar co-purification of the enzyme and its substrate. They then determined by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) the structure of osteocalcin bound to the γ-carboxylase in the presence of its native low-affinity propeptide. The obtained high-quality cryo-EM maps revealed that osteocalcin binds to the γ-carboxylase in a partially folded conformation through multiple interaction interfaces. One surprising finding is that the native osteocalcin propeptide, which has very poor affinity for γ-carboxylase when tested alone,7binds stably to the enzyme when attached to mature osteocalcin. Another important observation emanating from the structure analysis is that the mature region of osteocalcin interacts extensively with γ-carboxylase, and that these additional interactions occur even in the presence of the low-affinity native osteocalcin propeptide. This latest result is consistent with the previous observation that the enzyme can bind and γ-carboxylate mature osteocalcin lacking the propeptide in vitro.8 Further analyses revealed that, when bound to γ-carboxylase, the C-terminal region of mature osteocalcin adopts a structure characterized by two helices forming an “L” shape, that fits in a similarly shaped groove in the enzyme. The interactions between osteocalcin helices and γ-carboxylase occur primarily through hydrophobic contacts. Disruption of these hydrophobic interactions through mutations in osteocalcin C-terminal region or the γ-carboxylase groove significantly reduces the capacity of osteocalcin to stimulate enzymatic conversion of VKH2to VK epoxide, underscoring their importance for enzymatic activation. In a previously published structure of γ-carboxylase bound to factor IX, the C-terminal region of the Glu-rich region of factor IX, which lacks the hydrophobic residues present in osteocalcin C-terminus, was not found to form any interaction with the enzyme.6These results highlight an important difference in the recognition of osteocalcin and coagulation factors by the γ-carboxylase. In vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, high-affinity binding of the propeptide is sufficient to activate the γ-carboxylase (Fig.1a), while osteocalcin needs to bind the enzyme through its C-terminal domain to allow a conformational change that in turn stabilizes the low-affinity binding of its propeptide. Therefore, stable binding of pro-osteocalcin to the γ-carboxylase and its subsequent carboxylation, relies on an avidity-based mechanism whereby multiple interactions between the enzyme and its substrate compensate for the relatively weak affinity of each individual region (Fig.1b).Fig. 1: Comparison of the binding and carboxylation mechanism of factor IX and osteocalcin.aCoagulation factors, such as factor IX, are recognized by the γ-carboxylase (GGCX) through strong binding of their propeptide (+++). This strong interaction facilitates efficient processivity of the enzyme, resulting in complete γ-carboxylation of the Glu residues (E).bOsteocalcin is recognized by GGCX through multiple weak interactions (+) involving its propeptide and two C-terminal helices. This may result in incomplete processing and undercarboxylation of osteocalcin on Glu17(E17), allowing the production of bioactive osteocalcin. Created in BioRender.com.Full size image The understanding of the unique mechanism underlying osteocalcin recognition by the γ-carboxylase has important biological implications. Vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors are very efficiently carboxylated on each of their multiple Glu residues due to the high affinity of the enzyme for their propeptide (Fig.1a). The lower affinity of the osteocalcin propeptide probably results in reduced processivity of the γ-carboxylase, thereby allowing the production of fully carboxylated and undercarboxylated osteocalcin (Fig.1b). Indeed, Cao et al. found that a significant proportion of osteocalcin is undercarboxylated on Glu17following interaction with γ-carboxylase in the presence of VKH2. This is of particular interest, since Glu17osteocalcin (Glu13in mice) was proposed to be the bioactive form of the hormone in the circulation.10,11Overall, the different mechanisms by which osteocalcin is recognized by γ-carboxylase may allow the osteoblast to adapt its production of bioactive undercarboxylated osteocalcin in response to specific physiological cues, such as insulin, exercise or acute stress, which were previously shown to modulate serum levels of undercarboxylated osteocalcin.4,12The discovery also suggests that it could be possible to develop small molecules targeting the interactions between γ-carboxylase and osteocalcin C-terminal helices to increase the production of bioactive osteocalcin without impacting coagulation factor activity. This may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of diabetes or cognitive decline. Recently, ER Gla protein (ERGP) was identified as a novel transmembrane γ-carboxylated protein expressed by pancreatic β cells and hepatocytes.13This protein lacks the sequence found in the propeptide region of the other Gla proteins, including osteocalcin, but is nevertheless carboxylated by the γ-carboxylase in a vitamin K-dependent manner on multiple Glu residues located in its luminal domain. Based on the work of Cao et al., it would be interesting to test whether ERGP is recognized by γ-carboxylase through multiple weak binding sites, as it is the case for osteocalcin. In summary, the work of Cao et al. shows that mammalian γ-carboxylase has more than one way to recognize vitamin K-dependent proteins. The elucidation of the structural basis for the γ-carboxylation of osteocalcin also set the stage for developing novel therapies for bone and metabolic disorders. Berkner, K. L. & Runge, K. W.Int. J.

    "abstract": "The WNK-OSR1/SPAK protein kinase pathway regulates ion homeostasis and cell volume, but its other functions are not well understood. To discover undefined signaling functions, we utilized experimentally-derived binding specificity to predict interactions and relative affinities with the conserved C-terminal (CCT) domains of OSR1 and SPAK, which bind short linear motifs. The upstream kinases WNKs 1-4 and their relatives, the pseudokinases NRBP1/2, also contain CCT-like domains which have conserved folds and motif binding pockets. Motifs were scored using peptide arrays, conservation, cytosolic localization, and solvent accessibility. Out of nearly 3700 motifs in the human proteome, 90% of previously published motifs ranked in the top 2% of those predicted. Interactions with selected candidates, including TSC22D1 and CAVIN1, were validated, and their localization and/or modifications were coupled to changes in WNK1 signaling. We also identified additional motif variants and confirmed binding to the NRBP1 CCT-like domain. Our results stress the diverse functionality of CCT/CCT-like domains and implicates unexpected interactions driving WNK biology.",

    "abstract": "Social connection, a basic human need, is vital during adolescence. How a lack of connection impacts adolescent behaviour is unclear. To address this question, we employed experimental short-term isolation with and without access to virtual social interactions (iso total; iso with media; order counterbalanced, both compared to a separate baseline session). Using computational modelling and linear mixed-effects models, we assessed how isolation impacts self-reported loneliness, reward seeking and reward learning in adolescents (N = 40) aged 16–19 years. Self-reported state loneliness increased as a function of duration of isolation. When participants had access to virtual interactions, they self-reported less state loneliness during isolation. Isolation was associated with faster decisions to exert effort for rewards and improved reward learning. These effects were stronger in participants who reported higher state loneliness following isolation. These results demonstrate that, in adolescents, isolation is associated with higher reward responsiveness, a key driver of motivation and decision-making.",

    "title": "We still need to bridge the gap",
    "abstract": "When I teach evidence-based dentistry, I often recall one clinical case from dental school. A partial denture patient came to me with a loose denture that needed to be replaced. As a student, I followed my clinical supervisors’ instructions and the textbooks meticulously to make a new denture. The patient hated the final result. This led to awkward tension between my supervisor and the patient, who had very different views on the denture. After some back and forth, my supervisor told me angrily, “The patient is wrong. Why are you listening to him? I tell you, this is how it is done.” The situation never sat right with me. Years later, I realised that the aspects my supervisor insisted upon were based on limited evidence. The case was an example of my early struggles to understand how to integrate patient views, clinical experience, and research evidence. Joining the evidence-based health care community became my way of answering that challenge. In 1998, Derek Richards and Alan Lawrence in 19981wrote in one of the early editorials,“This approach [referring to evidence based dentistry] needs to take place not only amongst the ranks of the post graduates but equally importantly in the dental schools. The pressure of practice tends to get dentists to switch off the ‘learn mode’ but there is a need to switch on ‘learn mode’ again. The experience in Canada that evidence-based doctors are happier doctors and transferring this satisfying effective practice to dentistry can be a market asset in the new world of dentistry.” I can’t speak for all dentists, but I was definitely a happier dentist when I learned about evidence-based dentistry. In 2011, Professor Elizabeth Kay offered me a position as a lecturer in Evidence-Based Dentistry at Peninsula Dental School, with a vision on how we can make dentistry more evidence-based and patient-centred, a vision she carried forward as Editor of this journal. I am honoured to take over from her, now as a Professor in Clinical Epidemiology and Oral Health Research at the University of Plymouth, and to continue her legacy. In her first Editorial in 2019, Elizabeth Kay spoke about “bridging the gap”2between research and clinical practice. She reminded us that dentistry demands a unique range of skills from technical expertise, people skills, composure under pressure and business management and that we need to develop evidence on diverse questions and uncertainties we face. We have been slow in bridging the gap. This is not unique to dentistry. Alessandro Liberati, a year before his life was cut short, reflected on his different roles as a researcher, as a person who was responsible for allocating funding for research, and as an individual who had multiple myeloma. He highlighted how little research had progressed around the gaps in the effectiveness of interventions in multiple myeloma in a decade3. One initiative that I worked with Liz illustrates an approach to bridge the gap: rapid reviews commissioned by the British Dental Association and Shirley Glasstone Hughes Trust4. The process began with primary care dentists identifying priority topics, followed by rapid reviews of evidence, and then commissioning new research where gaps existed. As a junior academic then, I was surprised that the prioritised questions were not all clinical, as I had expected, but also addressed wellbeing and sustainability. We need more initiatives like this in our research system. Beyond dentistry, major initiatives have been reshaping how we approach research:The REWARD (REduce research Waste And Reward Diligence) initiative, [https://www.thelancet.com/campaigns/efficiency] launched byThe Lancetin 2014, aims to reduce waste and maximise the value of research.The Cochrane Priority Setting Methods Group [https://methods.cochrane.org/prioritysetting/] that focuses on developing methods and guidance around methods for research priority setting or developing a research agendaThe Evidence-Based Research Network [https://ebrnetwork.org/] that promotes two major values: (a) no new research studies without prior systematic reviews of existing evidence; (b) efficient production, updating and accessibility of systematic reviewsThe James Lind Alliance [https://www.jla.nihr.ac.uk/] that brings patients, carers, and clinicians together to identify and prioritise unanswered questions that they agree are the most important, so that research funders are aware of the issues that matter most to them. We have made progress, but we have a long way to go to bridge the gap, and I think we, as dentists and dental researchers, need to do even more to address the specific challenges of our own discipline to bridge the gap. However, the first step is to be open to challenging what we think we know about dentistry. My predecessor, Professor Elizabeth Kay, took a key step toward addressing this gap by broadening the journal’s scope to include systematic reviews, methodological studies, and feasibility studies. This created a stronger foundation for translating research into practice. Building on that vision, I intend to champion patient-centred and evidence-based research that directly informs important clinical questions. Research that not only answers “what works,” but also reflects the realities, priorities, and values of those delivering and receiving dental care. Richards D, Lawrence A. Evidence-based dentistry.

Byar’s method was used to calculate confidence intervals to determine significant changes in the number of new registrations in 4 early intervals amongst conditions that recorded >5 registrations in every year or the study.ResultsBetween 2009–2022 there were 18,387 new registrations (10,915 SI and 7472 SSI). Disorders of the CNS (4145), retinal disorders (2990), and congenital abnormalities of the eye (4491) made up nearly 2/3 of the registrations. Amongst SI registrations, there was a significant increase in these 3 groups over the 13-year period excluding the first year of the Covid pandemic. However, there was a significant decrease in SSI registrations for congenital abnormalities.ConclusionsOverall, there is an increasing number of children registered SI/SSI in England and Wales. The main causes are: disorders of the CNS, retinal disorders and congenital abnormalities of the eye. This may be due to increasing awareness, early screening and advancements in genomic testing.",

    "abstract": "Background/ObjectivesAtrial fibrillation (AF) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are common debilitating conditions that share pathomechanisms involving chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. However, the association between AMD and AF, which is important for comprehending the pathogenesis, referral, and treatment strategies of these diseases, remains unknown.Subjects/MethodsThis nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study used claims data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. From 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2018, an AF and AMD cohort of 34,236 and 31,766 patients, respectively, along with their matched control cohorts, were constructed using stabilised inverse probability of treatment weighting. The primary outcomes were the incidence of AMD following newly diagnosed AF and the incidence of AF following newly diagnosed AMD. A Cox regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) for these outcomes. Subgroup analysis based on AMD subtype and stratified analyses by age and sex were also conducted.ResultsCompared with controls, patients with AF had a significantly increased risk of developing AMD (HR 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04–1.17). Similarly, patients with AMD had a significantly increased risk of developing AF (HR 1.08; 95%CI 1.02–1.15). Further subgroup analysis revealed a reciprocal association between AF and dry AMD. Age- and sex-stratified analyses demonstrated increasing risk trends for AF and AMD.ConclusionsAF and AMD may share common underlying risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms. Our findings identified a reciprocal association between AF and AMD. Further research is warranted to elucidate the pathophysiology of AF and AMD.",

    "abstract": "Double-strand breaks represent the most dangerous form of DNA damage, and in resting cells, these breaks are sealed via the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) factor Ligase IV (LIG4). Excessive NHEJ may be genotoxic, necessitating multiple mechanisms to control NHEJ activity. However, a clear mechanism of transcriptional control for them has not yet been identified. Here, we examine mechanisms governingLig4transcription in mammals, finding that most tissues maintain very low levels of LIG4 production. Select tissues upregulate LIG4, employing different strategies for genomic regulation. In developing lymphocytes, theLig4locus is devoid of long-range chromatin contacts; instead, its expression and role in immune development depend upon a promoter-proximal intronic regulatory element. Deletion of the Lig4 intronic regulatory element results in thymocyte-specific loss of Lig4 upregulation, defects in lymphocyte development, and altered antigen receptor rearrangement. Our findings show the NHEJ gene,Lig4, is transcriptionally controlled to support stage-specific function concurrent with programmed DSBs. Moreover, we provide an example of how DNA cis-regulatory elements very close to a promoter can have substantial transcriptional effects.",

    "abstract": "Side reactions between high-voltage cathodes and electrolytes remain a critical obstacle to the advancement of solid-state batteries—particularly for Na-ion systems—due to the higher Na+/Na redox potential. Despite recent extensive efforts, achieving a long cycle life is still challenging at the 4.2 V cut-off (versus Na+/Na). Here we design a room-temperature isotropic epitaxial growth to achieve a relatively uniform and dense metal–organic framework epilayer on Na3V2O2(PO4)2F surfaces. Despite using polyethylene oxide, a typical ether-based solid polymer electrolyte, the cathode with isotropic epilayer exhibits enhanced cycling performance at the 4.2 V cut-off (retaining up to 77.9% of its initial capacity after 1,500 cycles). Combining experimental measurements and theoretical analyses, the key factor governing isotropic epitaxial growth behaviour is explicitly elucidated. Furthermore, we develop a self-designed high-sensitivity characterization method, in situ linear sweep voltammetry coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, to elucidate the failure mechanism of polyethylene oxide on Na3V2O2(PO4)2F surfaces and and to reveal the excellent electrochemical stability of the isotropic epilayer. Interestingly, the universality of this approach has also been validated, highlighting its strong potential as an effective strategy for enabling high-energy-density batteries.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear fusion could offer clean, abundant energy. However, managing the power exhausted from the core fusion plasma towards the reactor wall remains a major challenge. This is compounded in emerging compact reactor designs promising more cost-effective pathways towards commercial fusion energy. Alternative Divertor Configurations (ADCs) are a potential solution. In this work, we demonstrate exhaust control in ADCs, employing a novel method to diagnose the neutral gas buffer, which shields the target. Our work on the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak Upgrade shows that ADCs tackle key risks and uncertainties for fusion energy. Their highly reduced sensitivity to perturbations enables active exhaust control in otherwise unfeasible situations and facilitates an increased passive absorption of transients, which would otherwise damage the divertor. We observe a strong decoupling of each divertor from other reactor regions, enabling near-independent control of the divertors and core plasma. Our work showcases the real-world benefits of ADCs for effective heat load management in fusion power reactors.",

    "abstract": "Cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs) constitute the largest group of pore-forming toxins and serve as critical virulence factors for diverse pathogenic bacteria. Several CDCs are known to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, although the mechanisms are unclear. Here we discovered that multiple CDCs, which we referred to as type A CDCs, were internalized and translocated to thetrans-Golgi network (TGN) to remodel it into a platform for NLRP3 activation through a unique peeling membrane mechanism. Potassium efflux was dispensable for CDC-mediated TGN remodeling and NLRP3 recruitment, but was required for the recruitment of the downstream adaptor ASC. In contrast, desulfolysin, which we referred to as type B CDC, was not internalized or translocated to the TGN due to its distinct C-terminal domain 4, despite potent pore formation on the plasma membrane, and hence could not activate NLRP3. Our discoveries uncovered the ability of CDCs to directly remodel an intracellular organelle for inflammatory response.",

    "abstract": "Genetic sequencing has revealed that geographically dispersed Sri Lankan groups share ancestry with South Indian communities, such as the Mala and Madiga groups from Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Credit: Westend61 GmbH/ AlamyA study1has found that today’s Sri Lankan Adivasis, and Sinhalese — the country’s largest ethnic group — share close genetic ties with each other, and with Dravidian-speaking groups in south India, prompting reconsideration about how people may have moved and mixed across south Asia.The whole-genome sequencing exercise – the largest of its kind in Sri Lanka – was performed by an international team of geneticists from India, Sri Lanka, and the United States. The team sequenced whole genomes from 54 individuals — including 35 Sinhalese and 19 Adivasi from two distinct clans — and used advanced modelling to reconstruct population movements and genetic mixing over millennia.It reveals that the geographically dispersed Sri Lankan groups share significant strands of ancestry with South Indian communities, such as the Mala and Madiga groups from Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The finding adds a twist to the prevailing historical narrative and past research. Ancient chronicles and linguistic traditions suggest that the Sinhalese migrated from northern India around 500 BCE — a view supported by the Indo-European origins of the Sinhala language.The genetic evidence, however, does not show stronger affinities with populations from central, north, or northeast India. “The Sinhalese (and Adivasi) cluster more closely with south Indian groups with high Ancestral South Indian (ASI) ancestry,” said Niraj Rai.Previous research2, including that by Rai, had indicated a western Indian origin for the Sinhalese, showing genetic links to groups like the Marathas.The lack of concordance is interesting and is worth deeper investigation, says co-author Maanasa Raghavan, but she cautions against conflating the two lines of evidence or giving undue weight to one over the other. “If they don’t agree, it’s not because one (genetic) is necessarily right. We should accept that all the proposed links derive from different types of human interactions (cultural vs genetic).For one, people move, and those occupying particular regions of India today may not necessarily have done so thousands of years ago,” says Raghavan, an ancient DNA expert at the University of Chicago.Ancient DNA from the right space and time can confirm this, along with more integration from linguistic and historical investigations. “Until then, we can speculate on the discordance,” Raghavan notes.The study finds that the Sri Lankan Adivasi, who continue to speak Vedda — a language with no known relatives — and live a traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle, share deep genetic links with tribal populations in southern India, such as the Irula and Paniya.Notably, in terms of genetic proportions, the Sinhalese, Adivasi, and Sri Lankan Tamils closely resemble South Indian populations, suggesting that there has been no major genetic input from outside South Asia in the Sri Lankan gene pool. The findings suggest that the ancestors of the sampled Adivasi clans probably intermingled with migrants from mainland India early on — a view that complements archaeological and linguistic hypotheses which place the Vedda as the earliest inhabitants of the island, followed by Tamil and Sinhalese migrations between 2200 and 2500 years ago.Reopened questions and the road aheadThe new paper is intriguing, says Gyaneshwer Chaubey at the Banaras Hindu University. The deep genetic link between Vedda and mainland India, as seen in a mitochondrial DNA study3, isn’t clearly reflected in the new analysis. “It feels like we’re back to the beginning,” said Chaubey, a co-author of the two previous studies.“It would be very interesting to now explore paternal ancestry, which has not yet been examined.”The team speculates that language was probably passed on through cultural mechanisms — such as influence, trade, or conquest — rather than large-scale migration.",

    "abstract": "Within most tissues, the extracellular microenvironment provides mechanical cues that guide cell fate and function. Changes in the extracellular matrix such as aberrant deposition, densification and increased crosslinking are hallmarks of late-stage fibrotic diseases that often lead to organ dysfunction. Biomaterials have been widely used to mimic the mechanical properties of the fibrotic matrix and study pathophysiologic cell function. However, the initiation of fibrosis has largely been overlooked, due to challenges in recapitulating early stages of disease progression within the native extracellular microenvironment. Here, using visible-light-mediated photochemistry, we induced local crosslinking and stiffening of extracellular matrix proteins within ex vivo mouse and human lung tissue. In ex vivo lung tissue of epithelial cell lineage-traced mice, local matrix crosslinking mimicked early fibrotic lesions that increased alveolar epithelial cell mechanosensing, differentiation, and nascent protein deposition and remodelling. However, the inhibition of cytoskeletal tension, mechanosensitive signalling pathways or integrin engagement reduced epithelial cell spreading and differentiation. Our findings emphasize the role of local extracellular matrix crosslinking and nascent protein deposition in early stage tissue fibrosis and have implications for ex vivo disease modelling and applications to other tissues.",

We use four-dimensional multichannel printing to fabricate a flexible multichannel ferromagnetic catheter with a multichannel-sheath structure, comprising six liquid metal microchannels embedded in a polymer matrix for electrical conduction. The catheter can navigate through blood vessels and intestines using magnetically controlled active steering, being used for renal vein or intestines interventional surgeries and in situ multimetabolite sensing on rabbit and porcine models.

Here we report the results of the phase 1/2 umbrella trial NCT Neuro Master Match (N2M2), which evaluated targeted treatments in 228 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma without O6-methylguanine DNA-methyltransferase promoter hypermethylation. Stratification for treatment was conducted by a trial-specific molecular tumor board across five subtrials, each evaluating a targeted therapy—alectinib, idasanutlin, palbociclib, vismodegib or temsirolimus—selected according to the best-matching molecular alteration. Patients without matching alterations were randomized between subtrials without strong biomarkers using atezolizumab and asunercept, and the standard of care (SOC), temozolomide. All received radiotherapy. The primary endpoints were dose-limiting toxicities (phase 1) and progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS-6; phase 2). Secondary endpoints included safety and tolerability, as well as overall survival (OS). The subtrials for alectinib and vismodegib did not open as they did not have matching patients. The idasanutlin subtrial (n= 9) was terminated early at the discretion of the manufacturing company. The temsirolimus subtrial (n= 46) demonstrated a PFS-6 of 39.1% and median OS of 15.4 months in patients with activated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling compared to a PFS-6 at 18.5% in the SOC group (n= 54), meeting the primary endpoint.

This sensory signal is transduced into cyclic diGMP second messengers, but no known Psl receptors and adhesins participate in signal transduction. Here, using bacteria-secreted Psl trails, glycopolymer-patterned surfaces, longitudinal cell tracking, second messenger dual reporters and genetic mutations targeting EPS binding and surface twitching, we find that Pa is capable of sensing EPS directly through mutually constitutive interactions between type IV pili (T4P)-powered twitching and specific adhesin–EPS bonds. This unanticipated mechanochemical surveillance of the Pa environment, where T4P pull against cell-body localized adhesins interacting with EPS trails, such as mannose-binding CdrA, generates a hybrid, transitional planktonic-to-biofilm population with elevated cyclic diGMP and elevated cyclic AMP, as well as increased motility capable of following EPS trails.

Using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, the researchers found reduced Li levels in the blood and prefrontal cortex of individuals with mild cognitive impairment and AD, possibly due to sequestration by amyloid-β. In mouse models of AD and in aged mice, exposure to a Li-deficient diet reduced microglial amyloid-β clearance, increased tau pathology and neuroinflammation, partly via GSK3β activation, and impaired learning and memory. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that various brain cell types in Li-deficient AD-model mice shared gene expression patterns with those in the brain of patients with AD. Notably, treating AD-model mice and aged mice with lithium orotate decreased inflammation, restored microglial function, and strongly reduced AD pathology and memory impairments. These findings underscore the critical role of endogenous Li homeostasis in cognitive resilience and suggest its therapeutic potential in brain aging and AD.Original reference:Naturehttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09335-x(2025)",

The mechanism is complex, involving metabolic alterations caused by changes in liver function. Writing inCell, Garrett, Darzi et al. report altered vagal activity patterns and increased activity of the vagal dorsal motor nucleus (VDMN) in mouse models of lung or pancreatic cancer. This was preceded by increased levels of the chemokine CCL2 in the VDMN and liver and reduced expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-α (HNF4α), which regulates hepatocyte gene expression and, thereby, liver metabolism. Blocking CCL2 function reduced both the vagal alterations and cachexia symptoms. Severing of the right cervical vagus nerve reduced muscle atrophy, weight loss, anorexia and depression-like behavior, and increased liver HNF4α levels, improved liver function and increased life span, but it did not reduce tumor size. Blocking vagal nerve transduction through daily application of transcutaneous low-frequency alternating currents (LFAC) had similar effects and restored vagal tone; combining the LFAC block with chemotherapy resulted in increased survival benefits. These findings provide proof-of-concept evidence that transcutaneous LFAC block of the right vagus nerve can alleviate cancer cachexia and improve survival.Original reference:Cellhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2025.07.016(2025)",

Here we report superconductivity in a distinct hybrid nickelate, La5Ni3O11, formed by alternating stacks of La3Ni2O7and La2NiO4layers. This nickelate also exhibits a density-wave transition at approximately 170 K near ambient pressure. With increasing pressure, this density-wave transition shifts to higher temperatures and abruptly disappears around 12 GPa, followed by the emergence of superconductivity, indicating a first-order phase transition. But the optimal superconductivity with large superconducting volume fraction is observed at approximately 21 GPa with\\({T}_{{\\rm{c}}}^{{\\;\\rm{zero}}}\\)= 54 K. High-pressure X-ray diffraction experiments reveal a structural phase transition from an orthorhombic structure to a tetragonal structure at lower pressure. Notably, this structural change has minimal impact on the density-wave or superconducting phases, suggesting a limited role of lattice degrees of freedom in this material. These findings establish La5Ni3O11as a new superconducting member of the Ruddlesden–Popper nickelate family and offer valuable insights into the interplay between structure, electronic order and superconductivity in hybrid nickelates.",

    "title": "Nitrogen enhances post-drought recovery in wheat by modulating TaSnRK2.10-mediated regulation of TaNLP7",
    "abstract": "Drought stress affects plant growth and agricultural production, especially in the context of global climate change. Post-drought rehydration is crucial for plant recovery and sustained growth, yet the mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood. Nitrogen fertilizer plays a role in optimizing plant growth and enhancing stress resistance, but its role in post-drought recovery has not been fully elucidated. Here we demonstrate that nitrogen enhances post-drought recovery in wheat by modulating TaSnRK2.10-mediated regulation of TaNLP7. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that nitrogen supplementation increased the positive effects of rewatering on gene expression. Nitrogen inhibits the activity of TaSnRK2.10, a kinase involved in abscisic acid signalling. TaSnRK2.10 interacts with and phosphorylates TaNLP7-3A, a master regulator of the nitrate signalling pathway, reducing its nuclear localization and stability. This phosphorylation event suppresses genes involved in nitrate response, inhibiting nitrate-induced growth. Analysis of the nitrogen response levels in a wheat natural population revealed that transcriptional levels of the two haplotypes ofTaSnRK2.10-4Arespond differently to abscisic acid and nitrate, providing insights into the selection of wheat varieties that may be better suited for different environmental conditions to optimize yield.",

    "title": "Naturally impaired side-chain shortening of aromatic 3-ketoacyl-CoAs reveals the biosynthetic pathway of plant acetophenones",
    "abstract": "Acetophenones, which show scattered distribution across phylogenetically distant plants and fungi, play diverse roles in plant–plant, plant–insect, plant–microbiome and even animal–insect interactions. However, the enzymatic basis of acetophenone biosynthesis in plants remains unknown. Here we elucidate the complete biosynthetic pathway of picein (4-hydroxyacetophenone glucoside) from 4-coumaroyl-CoA using pear (Pyrus) as a study system. We demonstrate that in certain pear cultivars, the acetophenone moiety originates from an impaired side-chain shortening reaction of an aromatic 3-ketoacyl-CoA intermediate, a key step in the β-oxidative biosynthesis of benzoic acid. This impairment results from a loss-of-function mutation in a peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase. The accumulated aromatic 3-ketoacyl-CoA is subsequently hydrolysed by a thioesterase and undergoes spontaneous decarboxylation to yield the acetophenone moiety. This rare metabolic phenomenon highlights that not only neofunctionalization but also loss-of-function mutations can drive diversification in plant secondary metabolism. Forward genetic approaches are powerful to shed light on such ‘hidden’ or recessive pathways in plants.",

    "title": "Quantitative mapping of smooth topographic landscapes generated using thermal scanning-probe lithography",
    "abstract": "Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is a powerful technique for mapping nanoscale surface properties through tip–sample interactions. Thermal scanning-probe lithography (tSPL) is an advanced SPM variant that uses a silicon tip on a heated cantilever to sculpt and measure the topography of polymer films with nanometer precision. The surfaces produced by tSPL—smooth topographic landscapes—allow mathematically defined contours to be fabricated on the nanoscale, enabling sophisticated functionalities for photonic, electronic, chemical and biological technologies. Evaluating the physical effects of a landscape requires fitting arbitrary mathematical functions to SPM datasets; however, this capability does not exist in standard analysis programs. Here, we provide an open-source software package (FunFit) to fit analytical functions to SPM data and develop a fabrication and characterization protocol based on this analysis. We demonstrate the benefit of this approach by patterning periodic and quasi-periodic landscapes in a polymer resist with tSPL, which we transfer to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flakes with high fidelity via reactive ion etching. The topographic landscapes in polymers and hBN are measured with tSPL and atomic force microscopy, respectively. Within the FunFit program, the datasets are corrected for artifacts, fit with analytical functions and compared, providing critical feedback on the fabrication procedure. This approach can improve analysis, reproducibility and process development for a broad range of SPM experiments. The protocol can be performed within a working day by a trained graduate student or researcher, where fabrication and characterization take a few hours, and software analysis takes a few minutes.",

Data from two stages of pharmacotherapy in the ‘Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care for Depression’ (EMBARC) study from participants with both brain and blood biomarkers were included (N= 197). Participants were initially randomized to sertraline or placebo (Stage 1), and depending on clinical response at week-8, their therapy in Stage 2 was either maintained or switched (to sertraline, if a non-responder to placebo, or to bupropion, if a non-responder to sertraline). Three readily accessible clinical features combined with 15 multi-modal features associated with baseline depression severity predicted stage 2 remission with an AUC of 0.74, 0.71, and 0.73 for sertraline, bupropion, and placebo treatment respectively. Propensity score-matching (causal inference) was conducted across Stage 2 treatment arms, and the same features were used to build an unsupervised model to produce the probability of remission to the given Stage 2 treatment (as factual outcome), as well as the alternative treatment not given (as counter factual). While the accuracy of observed outcomes across treatment arms was 82%, the accuracies of predicted counterfactual (unobserved) outcomes warrant future prospective studies. 16 weeks and associated biomarker-based prediction of counterfactuals suggest that the selected markers are highly sensitive features for guiding antidepressant treatment selection.",

    "abstract": "The current-induced motion of the magnetic domain wall (DW) in a synthetic antiferromagnet (SAF) has been reported to reach velocities of up to a few hundred m/s. By implementing this feature into three-terminal devices with sub-hundred nm sizes, it is possible to achieve higher density memory with SRAM-level nanosecond switching speeds. Two main hurdles for the realization of this type of device are (1) ensuring that the initial spin states on both ends of the device are anti-parallel and (2) minimizing the degradation of the SAF property during the ion beam etching process (IBE). Here, we present a new simple scheme of anti-parallel spin initialization and recovery process from the IBE damage. Employing these techniques on domain-wall magnetic tunnel junction (DW-MTJ) three-terminal devices, we validated numerous write operations with a domain wall velocity of about 73 m/s. Based on the results, when our device scales down to 100 nm in length, the expected write operation speed reaches 1.0 ns, which is comparable to SRAM’s speed.",

    "title": "Platelet factor 4 and stromal cell-derived factor are novel prognostic biomarkers for cerebral vasospasm and mortality after subarachnoid hemorrhage",
    "abstract": "Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is a life-threatening condition associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, mainly due to post-hemorrhagic complications such as cerebral vasospasm (CVS) and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). Recent evidence implicates platelet activation and inflammatory mediators in the cascade of secondary injury following aSAH. Monitoring and timely treatment of post-SAH complications is critical to improve clinical outcomes. Current methods of radiological diagnostic for monitoring are laborious and bound to multiple risks, including radiation exposure. Point-of-care blood biomarkers early after SAH are urgently needed to timely detect and treat post-SAH complications. This prospectively designed cohort study aimed to search for novel predictive biomarkers for vasospasm and clinical outcome with overarching goal to improve treatment decision during intensive care treatment. In this prospective study conducted from 2020 to 2022, 63 aSAH patients (16 male and 47 female) were enrolled. Blood samples were collected to measure platelet factor 4 (PF4) and stromal cell derived factor (SDF) levels. To detect vasospasm, computed tomography (CT) perfusions at day 0, 4, 7 and 11 after the SAH was performed and mean transient time (MTT) was quantified as a measure of cerebral perfusion. Clinical outcome was analysed using modified rankin scale (mRS). Clinical and radiological data was recorded prospectively. The association between PF4 levels and CVS was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and logistic regression, while linear regression analyses were performed to examine the correlations of PF4 with mean transit times (MTT) and of SDF with the day of death among non-survivors. Logistic regression revealed that each 1 ng/mL increase in PF4 was associated with a 38% increase in the odds of developing CVS (OR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.07–1.79;p= 0.01). Moreover, elevated PF4 levels were significantly correlated with longer MTT (β = 0.107 per ng/mL; 95% CI: 0.02–0.19;p= 0.02), suggesting impaired cerebral perfusion. Additionally, among non-surviving patients, higher SDF levels were significantly associated with a later occurrence of death (β = 0.01 per pg/mL; 95% CI: 0.001–0.019;p= 0.03). The findings indicate that PF4 and SDF are promising biomarkers in aSAH. Elevated PF4 levels are associated with an increased risk of CVS and impaired cerebral perfusion, while higher SDF levels correlate with mortality. These biomarkers may offer valuable insights for early risk stratification and pave the way for targeted therapeutic interventions in patients with aSAH.",

    "abstract": "Taste and smell are critical for food intake and maintaining adequate energy balance, particularly in isolated, confined, and extreme (ICE) environments. Hypoxic conditions, low humidity, and limited chemosensory exposure at Concordia Station in Antarctica may impair taste and smell functions, though research remains scarce. Gustatory and olfactory functions were assessed in 19 participants (39.2 ± 10.9 years) during two overwintering missions at Antarctic Concordia Station. Testing occurred six weeks pre-departure, three times during isolation, and six months post-isolation. Gustatory function was evaluated using ODOFIN Taste Strips; olfactory function using ODOFIN Sniffin’ Sticks. Additionally, subjective sensory reports were collected. Hyposmia increased during isolation, accompanied by a trend toward declining smell identification (p= 0.054), with limited follow-up data offering no clear evidence of recovery. Hypogeusia was primarily reflected in an elevated prevalence of reduced salt sensitivity during mid- to late isolation (p= 0.036), returning to baseline levels post-expedition. Subjective evaluations only partially aligned with psychophysical test results. A one-year stay at Concordia Station revealed individual variability in chemosensory responses, highlighting the sensitivity of taste and smell to environmental extremes. While causality remains unclear, the findings emphasize the need to monitor chemosensory function in extreme settings and constrained environments in everyday life.",

Comprehensive molecular studies are required to understand OC pathogenesis.KRASandNOXAgenes are involved in tumorigenesis and disease progression.KRASpromotes tumor growth, whileNOXAtriggers the apoptotic signaling pathway.MethodsFifty-six ovarian cancer patients and twenty healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Gene expression profiling was performed utilizing the qRT-PCR assay. Then, the proteomic levels ofKRASandNOXAgenes were assessed by the ELISA technique.ResultsThe results showed thatKRASgene expression was significantly increased in OC patients compared to controls (p< 0.0001). Additionally,KRASoverexpression was correlated significantly with more aggressive characteristics, including advanced stage, positive lymph invasion, and metastatic status (p= 0.04, 0.05, and 0.02, respectively). In contrast,NOXAexpression was downregulated in OC patients compared to controls (p= 0.001), and this reduction was more pronounced in patients with more aggressive characteristics (p= 0.001, 0.01, 0.0008, 0.02, respectively). At the transcriptomic level,KRASconcentration was higher among the patient group (p= 0.03) and correlated with aggressive tumor features (p= < 0.0001, 0.001, and 0.03, respectively). Interestingly, no significant changes were detected inNOXAprotein levels concerning ovarian cancer development and progression.

    "abstract": "This study investigated the prospective associations between changes in 24-h movement behaviors and physical fitness (PF) components in preschool children; and examined how the reallocation of time between movement behaviours was associated with longitudinal changes in PF. This is a two-year longitudinal study of 200 Chinese children aged 3–4 years old. At baseline and follow-up, 24-h movement behaviors including moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), light physical activity (LPA), screen-based sedentary behavior (SSB), non-screen-based sedentary behavior (NSB), and sleep were assessed. Balance, cardiorespiratory fitness, flexibility, muscle strength, muscular endurance, and speed-agility were measured using a balance beam test, 20-m shuttle run test, sit and reach test, handgrip test, sit-ups, and 4 × 10 m shuttle run test respectively. The robust compositional regression was employed to explore the association between changes in movement behaviours and PF components, and compositional longitudinal isotemporal substitution analysis was used for the time reallocation. LPA was positively associated with flexibility (β = 3.25, p < 0.05), while sleep was negatively associated with flexibility (β = −4.39, p < 0.05). MVPA was positively associated with muscular endurance (β = 1.36, p < 0.05) at follow-up. The addition of MVPA at the expense of other movement behaviors during the two years was associated with increased muscular strength at follow-up. Reallocations between sleep, NSB, SSB, and LPA showed significant associations with flexibility at follow-up. The impact of MVPA replacing other behaviors on muscular strength was smaller than other behaviors replacing MVPA. Our findings highlight the importance of maintaining PA time to promote PF levels in preschool children. Programs on encouraging a range of light to vigorous active play opportunities and balancing between sleep and PA are crucial for enhancing PF development in preschool children.",

The animals changed behavioral response to human presence can be considered as a tool/index to measure the disturbance. This study is an attempt to find out the strength of animal’s behavioural responses to human intruders through disturbance distance of Indian rhinoceros in Kaziranga National Park and help in fulfilling the dynamic function. The study was carried out in Kaziranga National Park from 2016 to 2018. Road transect method was used and the data was collected by scan animal sampling. The collected data was then analyzed with the help of SPSS. Different types of bahavioural response were recorded at various distance. The alert distance, flushing distance and chasing distance were found to be significantly different. Various other factors like habitat and wind direction influence the disturbance distance. Woodland shows less disturbance distance, while short grassland shows the highest. The disturbance distance was found to be higher when there was no wind and when the wind direction was from animal to observer. This is probably due to the strong hearing power and sense of smell respectively. The general linear model shows the contribution of all the variables on disturbance distance. Implementations of buffer zones based on the alert distance can increase the tolerance of the animals and reduce the disturbance.",

A study comprised of twenty-one treatments including fungal strains, bacterial strains and microbial consortia. In addition, nitrogen supplementation as well as the retention of rice crop residue and incorporation were included in treatments accordingly. The results showed that T12(Residue Incorporated + Microbial Consortia + Urea) have highest decomposition and enzyme activities. With content of rice residue decreased to cellulose 17%, hemicellulose 4% and lignin 16% from 41%, 9%, and 28% respectively in T12. Enzyme activities being highest on 30th DOA (Day of Application) were; cellulose activity of 0.691 µmole/ml/h, laccase activity of 705.7 µg/µl/h and peroxidase activity of 271.2 µmole/g/h in T12. The CO2emission by the T12were also highest on 30th day as 6.16 mg CO2/g/d, which still when compared to the values of open field burning were prominently lower.

Key geometric and statistical features, including area, skewness, kurtosis, and centroid deviation, are extracted from these dynamic patterns to construct robust indices for classification. Adaptive thresholds for each feature are determined dynamically, enabling accurate event detection without prior knowledge of the microgrid configuration. Numerical analysis demonstrates that the proposed method achieves high precision in detecting and distinguishing PQ disturbances, even under overlapping or noisy conditions. For instance, the method records Euclidean distance values of 0.7071 for swell and 0.5657 for harmonic distortion, while maintaining zero deviation for pure signals, validating its classification accuracy. The system exhibits strong resilience to unstable grid conditions and is computationally lightweight, making it suitable for real-time deployment in embedded devices within microgrids. Comparative evaluation reveals superior performance in terms of speed, accuracy, and false positive minimization, highlighting the potential of dynamic Lissajous patterns as a powerful tool for advanced PQ monitoring in smart grid infrastructures.",

    "abstract": "Ichthyosaurs were the first fully marine tetrapods, and evolved a streamlined body, flippers, live birth, and endothermy-like physiology. However, the transition to these adaptations and how it relates to divergence into ocean environments is ambiguous. Here, we use vertebral bone microstructure to document the first ontogenetic series of two Early Triassic taxa that include the oldest ichthyosaur foetal fossils. One series is fromGrippia, an early ichthyopterygian with a small body, and limbs with some plesiomorphic features. The other is a large, contemporaneous ichthyosaur,Cymbospondylus. Together, they phylogenetically bracket the ichthyopterygian-ichthyosaurian transition.Grippiahas a unique microstructure with a distinctive compacted outer layer, whereasCymbospondylusvertebrae are cancellous throughout, indicating a different ecology and swimming style. The dissimilar distribution of woven-parallel complex in the histology between the two taxa indicates that growth progressed at different speeds. We also document birth lines in ichthyosaurs for the first time. Pelagic, tail-propelled, rapid-growing ichthyosaurs were thus present less than five million years after the End Permian mass extinction, alongside more anguilliform ichthyopterygians. These data capture the ecological and evolutionary transition from reptiles with eel-like swimming to whale-like ichthyosaurs, implying a paradigm shift in ecology and physiology that paved the way for ichthyosaur radiation.",

    "abstract": "Bone metastasis most commonly occurs in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The TRPV6 calcium channel is absent in healthy prostate tissue, but its expression increases considerably during cancer progression. We hypothesized that cancer cells induce TRPV6 expression de novo to directly benefit from tightly regulated calcium intakeviaTRPV6 while providing cancer cells with a selective advantage for metastasis in the calcium-abundant niche, such as bone. Using a cohort of prostate cancer tissue biopsies from patients with a clinical history of at least 10 years after biopsy, we report that TRPV6 expression directly correlates with CRPC tumor aggressiveness and increased risk of metastasis development. The TRPV6 channel is involved in the acquisition of both mesenchymal and invasive phenotypes through increased phosphorylation of CaMK2 followed by the translocation of the transcription factor NF-κB to the nucleus and the expression of EMT markers, MMPs, and transcription factors such as Twist, Snail, and Slug. Moreover, TRPV6 expression was accompanied by increased formation of CXCR4/TRPV6 complexes. In vivo, mice bearingtrpv6+/+tumors presented increased metastasis, notably bone metastasis, whereastrpv6−/−mice developed no metastasis. Targeting TRPV6 with a monoclonal antibody resulted in a significant reduction in the metastatic burden and an increase in overall survival. When AMD3100, a selective inhibitor of the CXCR4 receptor, was combined with AMD3100, a synergistic effect on the suppression of metastasis development was achieved. Thus, the suppression of CRPC metastasis to bone can be achievedviasimultaneous targeting of TRPV6/CXCR4, demonstrating that combined therapy is a proof-of-concept approach in vivo.",

    "title": "“The antibiotic paradox” in allogeneic stem cell transplantation",
    "abstract": "In allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT), antibiotic treatment of neutropenic and organ infections is widely used and needed: Blood stream infections (BSI) account for the most severe manifestations and occur either during neutropenia or are associated with organ complications such as acute gastrointestinal (GI) Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) or pneumonia. Patients’ neutropenia and immunodeficiency demand immediate diagnosis and rapid empiric treatment until microbial culture results allow adapted treatment [1]. BSI affect between 13 and 30% of transplant recipients, markedly increasing mortality [2]. Due to the high BSI risk and the uncertain etiology of fever in the early transplant period, broad spectrum antibiotic treatment is started usually at the time of febrile neutropenia or fever of unknown origin (FUO) [3]. Current guidelines recommend de-escalation and discontinuation of antibiotics during neutropenia once infections clear [4]. Yet, a recent European survey, found only 36% of centers stop antibiotics before neutrophil recovery, resulting in long-term application.With the introduction of 16 s rRNA sequencing refined microbiota analyses showed, that this early and prolonged use of antibiotics resulted in intestinal dysbiosis with loss of commensal, protective bacteria, abundance of facultative pathogens such asEnterococci[5] as well as resistant pathogens such asKlebsiella, E. coliandPseudomonas[6]. Dysbiosis induces increased translocation and inflammation and patients who developed dysbiosis consistently experience worse outcomes compared to patients with diverse microbiota at neutrophil engraftment indicating the double-edged nature of early antibiotic treatment. The poorer outcome is mainly explained by an elevated risk of severe acute GvHD. Mechanistically, losing metabolites such as short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and indoles increases epithelial damage [7,8] and undermines immunoregulation e.g., by regulatory T cells and thus explain this observation. In this context, changes of 3-indoxyl sulfate, indole acetate, indole acetylglutamine, and indole propionate, may limit tolerogenic indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) induction and thereby affect allogeneic T cell reactivity [9].These findings although reproduced now in several analyses are confusing as they seem contradictory to the old observation of protection from acute GvHD by performing ASCT in germfree animal models [10] or by achieving complete decontamination especially in children, and we and other clinicians call it anantibiotic paradox. This paradox partly arises from the dual targets of antibiotic treatment. While antibiotics harm luminal microbiota and may induce mucus degradation, they also suppress and eliminate translocated bacteria that trigger GvHD. Intensive conditioning damages the epithelium, facilitating bacterial translocation – a hallmark of GvHD – which is amplified after loss of epithelial barrier integrity due to T cell mediated apoptosis seen in almost all patients suffering from GvHD; histologically, neutrophil infiltration is an indicator of bacterial translocation, leading to massive augmentation of T cell mediated damage by innate immune cell activation and inflammation [11]. In GvHD mice, living bacteria can be easily isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes, and patients with GI GvHD exhibit higher BSI rates, confirming the role of bacterial translocation. Thus, it is not surprising that murine models frequently report beneficial antibiotic effects because they cannot disentangle the impacts of dysbiosis and translocation due to overlapping kinetics (Fig.1).Fig. 1The antibiotic paradox explained by differential microbial targets: Early and prolonged antibiotic therapy affects luminal microbiota composition resulting in severe intestinal dysbiosis and an increased risk for acute GI GvHD and associated mortality (evidence by Weber et al. [15] and Peled et al. [5]). Antibiotic administration at GvHD onset suppresses bacterial translocation as important co-stimulator of T cell activation and may dampen GvHD (evidence by van Bekkum et al. [10], Schwab et al. [11]).Full size imageThisantibiotic paradoxexplains why antibiotics can either enhance or suppress T-cell mediated immunity, depending on the context: While dysbiosis erodes T-cell regulation and increases GvHD susceptibility, suppression of translocated bacteria dampens T-cell activation through reduced co-stimulation mitigating GvHD. More broadly, antibiotics may blunt beneficial immune reactions induced by checkpoint inhibitors or CAR T-cells. An imbalanced gut microbiome contributes to primary resistance against immune checkpoint inhibitors, a condition worsened by antibiotics, whereas restoring microbial diversity through fecal microbiota transplantation or application of bacterial consortia improves clinical response [12].A similar pattern was observed in patients treated with CAR-T cells, where clinical response was strongly correlated with a decrease in microbiome diversity and a subsequent systemic dysmetabolome, which was induced by prior use of broad-spectrum antibiotics with extensive anaerobic coverage, such as piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem [13]. This is likely due to the role of SCFAs in modulating metabolic fitness and epigenetic imprinting thus impacting CAR T cell differentiation and efficacy. Of note, initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics after CAR-T infusion with an exposure of less than 10 days did not appear to compromise anti-lymphoma treatment efficacy.Translating these findings into clinical practice remains challenging. Adhering to antibiotic stewardship and following de-escalation guidelines may reduce the antibiotic exposure, thereby minimizing the risk of dysbiosis. Improved diagnostic strategies to distinguish FUO from fever due to cytokine release syndrome (CRS) could restrict early antibiotic use as CRS typically occurs after the application of (i) CAR T cells, (ii) antibodies during conditioning or (iii) in patients receiving prophylaxis with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (Pt-Cy) prophylaxis due to T-cell activation in the 3-day period between graft infusion and start of immunosuppression. Our group recently implemented a restrictive antibiotic protocol for patients likely to develop fever due to CRS following Anti-thymocyte Globulin (ATG) treatment, and reducing overall antibiotic use in the early ASCT period by 30% and its initiation by six days until true neutropenic fever emerged. Although simple laboratory markers to differentiate CRS-induced FUO from infectious fever remain elusive, emerging molecular techniques to detect microbiota may soon improve diagnostics. Conversely, strategies such as a short course of systemic antibiotics or other approaches investigated in murine models so far may specifically suppress bacterial translocation in new onset GvHD and disrupt the vicious inflammatory circle in GvHD, though definitive clinical indicators of translocation are missing in daily clinical practices and clinical trials are needed to validate this approach. Antibiotic stewardship may be supplemented by additional strategies to restore diversity such as repeated fecal microbiota transfer, dietary interventions or approaches neutralizing antibiotics selectively in the gastrointestinal tract by β-lactam cleaving enzymes and charcoal-based adsorbents or engineered probiotics. Finally, we also have to be aware, that non-antibiotic drugs frequently used in the setting of SCT additionally interfere with diversity and may need consideration [14]. Nevertheless, recognizing the antibiotic paradox in the clinical situation can sharpen physicians’ commitment to antibiotic stewardship, an essential strategy amid rising multidrug resistances.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe cold-shock domain protein YB-1 is overexpressed in pleural mesothelioma (PM) and was shown to contribute to increased cell migration and platinum resistance.MethodsPhosphorylation of YB-1 at position serine 102 was analysed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and immunoblotting in PM tissue specimens and cell lines. Intracellular localisation experiments involved immunoblotting, transfection of fluorescent protein-tagged YB-1 and confocal imaging. YB-1 phosphorylation was inhibited with the RSK inhibitors BI-D1870 and LJH685. Effects of inhibition alone and in combination with radiation or cisplatin treatment were analysed by cell viability assays, clonogenic assays and videomicroscopy-based migration and cell fate map analyses.ResultsYB-1 phosphorylated at serine 102 is present in PM cell lines and tissue. Inhibition of phosphorylation with BI-D1870 reduced YB-1 localisation in the cell nucleus and led to reduced cell viability, clonogenicity, migration and disrupted cell division. Moreover, exposure to BI-D1870 increased the effect of radiation and cisplatin treatment with additive to synergistic effects in PM cell lines and primary cultures.ConclusionsThe serine 102 phosphorylated form of YB-1 contributes to the malignant phenotype of PM.

Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is a driver of TNBC metastasis, but the signaling underlying this metabolic change is poorly understood.MethodsWe performed metabolic assays and assessed migratory and metastatic potential in cells with manipulated CDCP1/mitochondrial Src signaling.ResultsWe show that the pro-metastatic cell surface protein CUB-domain containing protein 1 (CDCP1) activates Src kinase localized in mitochondria, which potently induces OXPHOS and TNBC migration. Genetic targeting of either CDCP1 or mitochondrial Src, as well as pharmacological inhibition of Src reduce OXPHOS in vitro. We further show that mitochondrial Src increases OXPHOS by stimulating Complex I activity in the electron transport chain. Importantly, rescuing Complex I activity in cells devoid of CDCP1/mitochondrial Src signaling restores both OXPHOS and migration. We also provide evidence that NAD+pool generated by Complex I is contributing to the observed migratory phenotype. Lastly, we determined that inhibiting mitochondrial Src reduces metastasis in TNBC cells.ConclusionsBoth CDCP1 and mitochondrial Src represent potential therapeutic targets to inhibit OXPHOS-mediated TNBC metastasis.",

Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) for associations between individual metabolites and breast cancer incidence. Associations with metabolite groups were assessed using metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA).ResultsSix individual lipid-related metabolites were nominally associated with breast cancer incidence (taurodeoxycholate [OR for per 1 standard deviation increase in metabolite level = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.04–1.28]; C16:1 cholesteryl ester [OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.79–0.97]; three phosphocholine (PC)-related metabolites, C34:1 PC [OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.78–0.98], C34:3 PC [OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.79–0.98], C32:1 PC [OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.79–0.98]; indoxyl sulfate [OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.82–1.00]).

    "abstract": "DNA damage response (DDR) is a complicated network that responds to DNA lesions to prevent their accumulation; a defective DDR is one hallmark of cancer. Although targeting DDR pathways has been considered as a therapeutic approach, DDR inhibitors have also been reported ineffective for treating some low mutation burden cancers, such as Mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged (MLL-r) leukemia, a clinically fatal and refractory malignancy. Exploring the roles and mechanisms of DDR pathways in these low mutation burden cancers may help understand the chromatin biology and develop therapeutic strategies. Here, we identified a set of DDR-related chromatin-associated circular RNAs (cacircRNAs) that regulate DNA repair via the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, which is vital for meeting the high DNA repair demands during the progression ofMLL-r leukemia. Among these cacircRNAs, we identified ciCRLF3(2) as a previously unknown component of the NHEJ complex. We showed that ciCRLF3(2) recruits NHEJ regulators to DNA lesions, supporting abundant DNA repair in leukemia cells. ciCRLF3(2) abundance is abnormally upregulated inMLL-r leukemia and indicates a poor prognosis. Targeting ciCRLF3(2) suppressed NHEJ-mediated DNA repair, leading to DNA damage and broad anti-cancer effects in vitro and in vivo. A patient-derived xenograft model ofMLL-r leukemia further indicated that ciCRLF3(2) depletion can decrease the leukemic burden. These findings demonstrate the function of cacircRNAs in DDR and chromatin biology and reveal a new avenue for developing strategies to treat low mutation burden cancers, such asMLL-r leukemia.",

Over the years, this interest has developed into a focus on how regional and large-scale processes interact, especially in sensitive environments like Antarctica. In polar climate research, one important trend is the growing focus on short-lived but intense extreme events such as heatwaves, strong warm air intrusions, and intense rainfall. These events can have a rapid and significant impact on glaciers, ice shelves, and ecosystems, but they are still not very well understood. At the same time, there is increasing awareness that polar systems, given the dramatic changes they are undergoing, can also influence atmospheric and oceanic circulations beyond the poles. This adds a global dimension to polar research. A continuing challenge is the limited availability of observations, particularly in polar and high mountain regions, which makes it difficult to fully understand the complete characteristics of such events and to improve climate models for these areas. Improving climate models for these areas remains essential for better understanding and predicting future changes. Yes, I think the article has helped to make the link between atmospheric rivers and ice shelf stability more clear and more accepted. What makes it especially valuable is that it examines the climatological aspects, not just individual events. This provides a broader context and shows how frequently such conditions occur. We already know that warm and moist air intrusions can cause surface melt, but this paper gives detailed evidence on how intense atmospheric rivers can directly influence ice shelf stability. This is important because it connects weather events with processes that can lead to longer-term ice loss. For me, it reinforces the idea that studying extreme events in Antarctica is not only about weather, but it is about understanding the future of the ice sheet and sea level rise. When I review a paper, I first read it fully to understand the main story. Then I go through it again more carefully, checking whether the methods are appropriate, the data are handled correctly, and the conclusions are supported by the results. I try to give constructive feedback that can help improve the paper, not just point out problems. I also remind myself that English is not the first language for many authors, including myself, so I focus on the scientific clarity and the accuracy of the content. To be fair and keep the review rigorous, I look only at what is in the paper itself. I try to give the same careful attention to every paper, whether it comes from a well-known group or a new researcher, and I keep my comments on the science and how clearly it is explained, not on who wrote it. Yes, I think peer review is very important for improving the quality of science and keeping the standards high, but there is room to make it more dynamic in some situations. For example, after the first round of reviews, a short and focused online exchange between reviewers and authors, guided by the editor, could be helpful when there are important points that are unclear or strongly debated. This would not be necessary for every paper, but in some cases, it could save time and avoid extra review rounds. Another point is that sometimes decisions rely too much on one negative review, even when the others are positive, so looking at the overall balance could make the process fairer. Finally, a short checklist from the editor on the main aspects to evaluate could make reviews more focused and consistent. I usually read the paper first just to understand the main idea and flow, without forming an opinion too quickly. Later, I go back to look more carefully at the details. I find it helpful to keep the comments clear and polite, even when there is strong disagreement. It feels important to also mention what is already done well, not only the parts that could be improved. Whenever I can, I add practical suggestions so the authors know how they might address the points raised. I focus on what is written in the paper, but I admit that seeing a well-known institution or a famous author can create an initial impression. This can sometimes make me expect a certain level of depth or quality in the work. At the same time, I know that valuable and original research can come from any researcher or institution. So, I make a conscious effort to set aside these first impressions and give every paper the same careful attention, regardless of where it comes from. Sometimes during a review, I notice my own work cited in a way I did not expect. It is interesting to see how other researchers interpret it and fit it into their story, and in some cases, it even makes me look at my results from a different angle.

    "abstract": "Solar radiation modification-based climate interventions may cause uneven regional hydrological changes while mitigating warming. Here, we investigate the effects of climate interventions on China’s North Drought-South Flood pattern using the Norwegian Earth System Model supplemented by volcanic data. Our results indicate that equatorial stratospheric aerosol injection could mitigate the north-south water divide by reducing inter-hemispheric and equator-to-North-pole temperature gradients, thereby modifying atmospheric circulation and the East Asian monsoon to increase precipitation and surface runoff in northern China while reducing them in the south, compared to the high emissions scenario. This mechanism is supported by observed precipitation changes following the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption. In contrast, marine cloud brightening may intensify southern flood risks, while cirrus cloud thinning and moderate emissions reduction might exacerbate northern droughts. Our findings reveal distinct regional hydroclimatic impacts of different climate interventions, highlighting potential synergies and trade-offs between their global intervention efficacy and regional water security.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundParticulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5 µm (PM2.5) is a heterogeneous mixture, and specific substances that affect cardiovascular events remain unknown. We aimed to examine the association of short-term exposure to PM2.5and its components with hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction (AMI).MethodsThe concentrations of total PM2.5and its individual components were continuously measured using Aerosol Chemical Speciation Analysers. From a national-scale administrative database collected from 828 facilities in 47 prefectures across Japan from April 2017 to December 2019, we extracted AMI data for seven prefectures where these aerosol analysers were installed. The primary outcome was the relationship of PM2.5and its components with AMI hospitalisation. A time-stratified case-crossover analysis was conducted, and the approximate risk of AMI by pollutant concentrations was estimated using a conditional logistic regression model. In total, 44,232 patients with AMI aged 40–104 years (74.9% male) were examined.ResultsThe estimated effect of an increase in the total PM2.5concentration is significantly associated with AMI-related hospitalisation. Upon further examination of the components of PM2.5, black carbon has a more substantial influence on AMI development than water-soluble organic compounds, nitrate, and sulphate ions.ConclusionsShort-term exposure to PM2.5is associated with an increased incidence of AMI. Future research prioritises the components of PM2.5, with particular focus on whether a decrease in black carbon concentrations can mitigate the risk of future air quality-related AMI.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOlder adults are vulnerable to mistimed food intake due to health and environmental changes; characterizing meal timing may inform strategies to promote healthy aging. We investigated longitudinal trajectories of self-reported meal timing in older adults and their associations with morbidity, genetic profiles, and all-cause mortality.MethodsWe analyzed data from 2945 community-dwelling older adults from the University of Manchester Longitudinal Study of Cognition in Normal Healthy Old Age, with up to five repeated assessments of meal timing and health behaviors conducted between 1983 and 2017. Linear mixed-effects models, latent class analysis, and Cox regression were used to examine relationships between meal timing with illness and behavioral factors, genetic scores for chronotype and obesity, and mortality.ResultsHere we show older age is associated with later breakfast and dinner times, a later eating midpoint, and a shorter daily eating window. Physical and psychological illnesses, including fatigue, oral health problems, depression, anxiety, and multimorbidity, are primarily associated with later breakfast. Genetic profiles related to an evening chronotype, but not obesity, are linked to later meals. Later breakfast timing is also associated with increased mortality. Latent class analysis of meal timing trajectories identify early and late eating groups, with 10-year survival rates of 86.7% in the late eating group compared to 89.5% in the early eating group.ConclusionsMeal timing, particularly later breakfast, shifts with age and may reflect broader health changes in older adults, with implications for morbidity and longevity.",

We describe here the case of a 49-year-old female patient treated with semaglutide for obesity, who presented with Wernicke encephalopathy in a context of iterative vomiting and reduced food intake. Eighteen other cases of Wernicke encephalopathy were reported in literature and in the WHO global safety database (VigiBase). A context of nausea/vomiting or reduced food intake is described in 68% of cases, with weight loss ranging from −3.5 to −13.3 kg/month over 3 to 6 months. Disproportionality analysis in VigiBase showed that Wernicke encephalopathy was disproportionately reported with semaglutide, tirzepatide and the whole GLP-1RAs group.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe global prevalence of high myopia is rising, posing a significant public health concern. Limited research exists on risk factors for prelaminar schisis (PLS) and its impact on visual field changes in highly myopic eyes. Herein, we investigated clinical features of prelaminar schisis (PLS) in highly myopic eyes.MethodsThis cross-sectional study included 245 eyes with high myopia and 64 eyes with emmetropia and low myopia. PLS was classified on a 3-point scale (0–2), and clinical characteristics were compared between two groups and three sub-groups. Factors associated with PLS presence and severity were evaluated in highly myopic eyes.ResultsHighly myopic eyes had a higher frequency (P= 0.008) and severity (P= 0.001) of PLS than controls. Among them, 33.47% (82/245) had Grade 0, 56.33% (138/245) had Grade 1, and 10.20% (25/245) had Grade 2. The presence of Bergmeister papilla (OR = 2.181, 95% CI: 1.080–4.406,P= 0.030), larger Bruch’s membrane opening (BMO) (OR = 1.927, 95% CI: 1.279–2.904,P= 0.002) and longer axial length (OR = 1.723, 95% CI: 1.186–2.499,P= 0.004) correlated with PLS severity. Eyes with Grade 2 PLS were more prone to visual field defect than eyes with Grade 0 (P= 0.005) and Gade 1 (P= 0.013) PLS.ConclusionBergmeister papilla presence, larger BMO, and longer axial length were associated with the PLS severity, suggesting ONH prelaminar schisis may indicate traction and myopic deformation of the ONH. PLS with peripapillary retinoschisis suggests a possibility of functional damage.",

    "title": "Using adaptive optics to assess hyporeflective clump speed and size in age-related macular degeneration in the PINNACLE Study. (PINNACLE Study Report 6)",
    "abstract": "Background/ObjectivesHyporeflective clumps (HRC) are a common finding in adaptive optics ophthalmoscopy (AOO) of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). They appear on optical coherence tomography (OCT) as hyperreflective foci (HRF) or abutting the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) layer as RPE thickening. The cellular origin of HRF is debated between migrated RPE cells and mononuclear phagocytes (MP). Microglial cells are MP known to migrate at 0.02 µm/s, but RPE migration speed is unknown. Phenotyping HRCs by migration speed and size may improve our understanding of HRFs.MethodsPatients with non-neovascular AMD were imaged with the RTX1 retinal camera (Imagine Eyes, Orsey, France). Pairs of AOO images taken 1–3 h apart were centred on areas with multiple HRCs and compared to identify mobile HRCs. Macular OCT scans were performed immediately after initial AOO.ResultsA total of 21 pairs of images from 14 eyes of 12 patients were of adequate quality to assess HRCs. There were 411 measurable HRCs, with a mean diameter of 15.9 ± 6.0 µm. The HRCs were larger in images of atrophy (p< 0.001). Within the timeframe assessed, most HRCs remained static, but mobile HRCs were not uncommon and migrated up to 0.015 µm/s. HRFs on OCT corresponding to mobile HRCs on AOO appeared adjacent to the RPE or in the interdigitation zone.ConclusionAOO can detect HRC movement in AMD in images captured a mean of 105.5 min apart. HRC size and movement speed are consistent with microglial cells, but may also represent RPE cells. HRCs appear larger in images of atrophy.",

    "title": "Density-dependent network structuring within and across wild animal systems",
    "abstract": "Theory predicts that high population density leads to more strongly connected spatial and social networks, but how local density drives individuals’ positions within their networks is unclear. This gap reduces our ability to understand and predict density-dependent processes. Here we show that density drives greater network connectedness at the scale of individuals within wild animal populations. Across 36 datasets of spatial and social behaviour in >58,000 individual animals, spanning 30 species of fish, reptiles, birds, mammals and insects, 80% of systems exhibit strong positive relationships between local density and network centrality. However, >80% of relationships are nonlinear and 75% are shallower at higher values, indicating saturating trends that probably emerge as a result of demographic and behavioural processes that counteract density’s effects. These are stronger and less saturating in spatial compared with social networks, as individuals become disproportionately spatially connected rather than socially connected at higher densities. Consequently, ecological processes that depend on spatial connections are probably more density dependent than those involving social interactions. These findings suggest fundamental scaling rules governing animal social dynamics, which could help to predict network structures in novel systems.",

    "abstract": "Avoiding lithium dendrites at the lithium/ceramic electrolyte interface and, as a result, avoiding cell short circuit when plating at practical current densities remains a significant challenge for all-solid-state batteries. Typically, values are limited to around 1 mA cm−2, even, for example, for garnets with a relative density of >99%. It is not obvious that simply densifying ceramic electrolytes will deliver high plating currents. Here we show that plating currents of 9 mA cm−2can be achieved without dendrite formation, by densifying argyrodite, Li6PS5Cl, to 99%. Changes in the microstructure of Li6PS5Cl on densification from 83 to 99% were determined by focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy tomography and used to calculate their effect on the critical current density (CCD). Modelling shows that not all changes in microstructure with densification act to increase CCD. Whereas smaller pores and shorter cracks increase CCD, lower pore population and narrower cracks act to decrease CCD. Calculations show that the former changes dominate over the latter, predicating an overall increase in CCD, as observed experimentally.",

    "title": "An ancient pea holds lessons for a warming Himalaya",
    "abstract": "Communities in Spiti harvesting green peas. Credit: Harman JaggiNeglected by science and at risk of being forgotten, a hardy pea nurtured for centuries in the Indian Trans-Himalaya survives better in harsh mountain conditions, and packs more nutrition than the cash crops that have taken over, a study1says.With a 3,000-year-history, the black pea, known locally assanmoh nakoordhoopchum, along with crops like barley (Hordeum vulgare), was once the staple of the food systems in the cold desert of Spiti Valley in Himachal Pradesh. But from the 1980s, as roads improved and market access grew, farmers shifted to commercial crops, especially green peas (Pisum sativumL.), which they could sell across India.In a region rapidly transformed by climate change, some families still grow these peas, tucked away in fields near homes and monasteries, flavouring traditional beverages that fuel long days at altitude.Now, science has caught up with local wisdom. Researchers at Stanford University in the United States and the Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF) in India, working with Himalayan farmers, have shown that black peas carry distinct genetic traits that could help crops in adapting to climate change.Their work combined more than 300 farmer interviews with field trials across villages at 4,000–4,500 metres, whole-genome sequencing, and nutritional analysis. Black peas not only germinate and survive better under stress, but they also outdo green peas in protein, fibre, and minerals.Sequencing suggests the existence of an unrecognized lineage within the pea family, distinct from domesticatedPisum sativum,as well as its wild relatives, such asP. fulvum. Others link it toLathyrusniger, a species native to Europe. Even India’s CSIR-Traditional Knowledge Digital Library Unit (CSIR-TKDL) found it challenging to trace the historical record of the black pea due to the confusion.“In the sequencing, it consistently forms its own cluster with affinities to Asian landraces,” says ecologist Harman Jaggi, who led the study while doing her PhD at Stanford University. She is currently at Princeton University.This divergence suggests millennia of selection under Himalayan culture and climate, reinforcing the region’s role as a secondary centre of pea diversity. Confirming this will require wider genomic sampling across India, Nepal, and Tibet, paired with archaeological and cultural evidence, says Rajeev Varshney, a plant geneticist at Murdoch University, in Perth, Australia, who was not involved in the study.“If validated, it would underscore the role of Himalayan smallholders in shaping crop diversity, complementing centres of domestication in the Fertile Crescent and Central Asia.”Recognising Trans-Himalayan farming systems as Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems under the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, could bolster preserving traditional knowledge while aligning crop conservation with biodiversity protection, the authors say.Rooted in tradition, tested by scienceThe researchers leaned on farmers’ knowledge to test the black peas, incorporating nuances, especially for irrigation, that could only be learned from them.For instance, in the high-altitude villages of Himachal Pradesh and Ladakh, farm water comes from centuries-old snowmelt-fed mountain channels calledkuhls. The first three watering events—yurma, shakti, and sumti—are important for pea crops. While green peas require 12 bouts of irrigation, black peas are ready with just eight, making them less water-intensive — an edge as glaciers retreat, hobbling water supply in thekuhls.“They also demand less labour. After the third irrigation, no weeding is required,” says farmer Cherring.In 2023 field trials, more black pea seeds germinated and successfully grew into established plants compared to green peas, regardless of location. They had taller stems, and more flowers and pods than green peas under limited water. At Kiamo, black peas achieved a 51% establishment rate, compared to lower survival for green peas. At the highest site, Tashigang (4500 m), survival fell across all crops, but overall, black peas outperformed cash crops in resilience traits.The black pea plant. Credit: Harman JaggiNutritional tests revealed 21.2% protein per 100 g—higher than green peas—plus rich fibre, iron, magnesium, calcium, vitamin C, and B vitamins. These results concurred with local anecdotes: Jaggi recalls her hosts offering tea mixed with black pea and barley flour during snow leopard surveys, which initially brought her to the region. “This would power us for hours,” she says.Since the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for wholesome foods has revived interest in traditional crops, says Viswajanani J. Sattigeri of CSIR-TKDL. Policies are supporting this shift, from farmers’ rights and biodiversity laws, to education frameworks that emphasise traditional knowledge.A standout example is millets, which, once supplanted by rice and wheat with the advent of the Green Revolution, are regaining popularity. A study2of more than 2,000 households in central India reveals that the successful revival of millet depends on safeguarding diversity, fair markets, and managing the income-nutrition trade-off where farmers who sell millets consume less nutritious food themselves.",

Here we report a continuous space-time crystal in a nematic liquid crystal driven by ambient-power, constant-intensity unstructured light. Our numerically constructed four-dimensional configurations exhibit good agreement with these experimental findings. Although meeting the established criteria to identify time-crystalline order, both experiments and computer simulations reveal a space-time crystallization phase formed by particle-like topological solitons. The robustness against temporal perturbations and spatiotemporal dislocations shows the stability and rigidity of the studied space-time crystals, which relates to their locally topological nature and many-body interactions between emergent spontaneously twisted, particle-like solitonic building blocks. Their potential technological utility includes optical devices, photonic space-time crystal generators, telecommunications and anti-counterfeiting designs, among others.",

    "title": "Improving the evidence base for COVID-19 vaccines",
    "abstract": "The beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic marked an unprecedented time when safe and effective vaccines were developed, authorized, and approved for use within months of the initial identification of the novel coronavirus1. These authorizations and approvals were based on large, placebo-controlled trials powered to characterize safety and efficacy against clinically significant infection — appropriate designs given the use of vaccine platforms, such as mRNA technology, and antigens, including the prefusion spike protein, that had not previously been studied at large scale in humans. These early studies were among the largest clinical trials in recent history, enrolling tens of thousands of participants and providing definitive evidence of the safety and efficacy of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.Since then, the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 has prompted annual updates to COVID-19 vaccine composition to match the predominant circulating strain. Multiple national surveillance platforms provide data on the effectiveness of current vaccines to inform the need for updates5. As with other seasonal vaccines (for example, influenza), these updates are based on immunobridging studies that compare neutralizing antibody titers induced by vaccines with new variant inserts to those induced by approved vaccines6. Licensure by a regulatory body typically requires non-inferiority of the investigational vaccine versus the approved vaccine, meaning that the investigational vaccine is not clinically significantly worse than the approved vaccine (Fig.1b). For seasonal vaccines, this is appropriate for several reasons. Annual vaccine updates require considerable lead time for production. For influenza, strain selection decisions are typically made 4–6 months in advance at a semiannual meeting convened by the World Health Organization, followed by a meeting of the US Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccine and Related Biologics Advisory Committee, which recommends strains to domestic vaccine manufacturers. To match the vaccine to circulating strains while also giving manufacturers sufficient time to produce the necessary doses for distribution, strain selection recommendations are made using immunobridging studies that show neutralization of new circulating variants. The timeline for COVID-19 vaccine updates might differ based on the evolution of the virus as well as use of mRNA technology, though it still requires lead time for production and distribution. Immunobridging is a well-established approach for seasonal vaccine strain selection and is standard practice in many countries.",

Using prespecified circulating tumor DNA analyses, we performed an exploratory study to evaluate whether pretreatment circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels in plasma can identify patients that benefit from CDK4/6i during their first-line treatment. Cell free DNA before start of first-line treatment from 409 female patients participating in SONIA was analyzed with the modified fast aneuploidy screening test-sequencing system. This assay yields a genome-wide aneuploidy score, indicative of ctDNA levels. Cox proportional hazard analyses for PFS1 and PFS2 were performed separately for the ctDNA high group (aneuploidy score ≥ 5) and the ctDNA low group (aneuploidy score < 5). In total, 141 of the 409 included patients had a high genome-wide aneuploidy score at baseline. PFS2 in the first- compared to the second-line CDK4/6i strategy showed hazard ratios of 0.58 (95% confidence interval 0.38–0.88) and 1.36 (95% confidence interval 0.95–1.96) in the high and low aneuploidy group, respectively. A significant interaction was demonstrated between treatment strategy and aneuploidy score for PFS2 (P= 0.004). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that pretreatment ctDNA levels can be used to identify patients that benefit from first-line CDK4/6i treatment. ClinicalTrials.gov registration:NCT03425838.",

    "title": "Alterations in aperiodic neural activity associated with major depressive disorder",
    "abstract": "Historically, aperiodic neural activity (the 1/fexponent and offset of electroencephalogram power spectra) has been treated as neural noise. However, recent work has highlighted associations among aperiodic activity, aging, cognition and psychopathology. Although depression has been associated with cognitive deficits and dysregulation of excitatory–inhibitory neural mechanisms linked to aperiodic activity, so far, few studies have compared aperiodic activity in adults with and without depression, and none have evaluated aperiodic activity as a function of depressive chronicity. Here individuals with depression (n= 72) and healthy controls (n= 34) completed a resting state electroencephalography recording from which aperiodic activity estimates were extracted. We show significant group differences in aperiodic exponent and offset across central and posterior regions, such that, as hypothesized, these parameters were lower for depressed individuals relative to controls. Follow-up analyses clarified that this effect was driven by the number of lifetime depressive episodes experienced. Future research is needed to understand how depression heterogeneity impacts aperiodic activity.",

    "abstract": "Microbial rhodopsins are photoreceptor proteins widely distributed in marine microorganisms that harness light energy and support marine ecosystems. While retinal is typically the sole chromophore in microbial rhodopsins, some proteorhodopsins, which are proton-pumping rhodopsins abundant in the ocean, use carotenoid antennae to transfer light energy to retinal. However, the mechanism by which carotenoids enhance rhodopsin functions remains unclear. Here, using the marineBacteroidotaisolateNonlabens marinusS1-08T, we reconstituted complexes of rhodopsins with the carotenoid myxol and detected energy transfer to retinal in both proteorhodopsin and chloride ion-pumping rhodopsin. Carotenoid binding facilitated light harvesting and accelerated the photocycle, thereby improving the light utilization efficiency of proteorhodopsin. Cryogenic electron microscopy structural analysis further revealed the molecular architecture of the carotenoid–rhodopsin complexes. The ability to bind carotenoids is conserved in rhodopsins of the marine-dominant phylumBacteroidota, which are widely transcribed in the photic zone. These findings reveal how carotenoids enhance rhodopsin functions in marineBacteroidota.",

Tau, a neuronal microtubule-associated protein, is well known for its role in stabilizing microtubule tips and promoting microtubule bundling. Here we demonstrate that tau also modulates microtubule lattice dynamics. Although tau lacks enzymatic activity, it significantly accelerates tubulin exchange within the lattice, particularly at topological defect sites. Our findings indicate that tau enhances lattice anisotropy by stabilizing longitudinal tubulin–tubulin interactions while destabilizing lateral ones, thereby enhancing the mobility and annihilation of lattice defects. These results challenge the traditional view of tau as merely a passive stabilizer, revealing its active role in dynamically remodelling the microtubule lattice structure.",

    "abstract": "The versatility of lanthanide-doped near-infrared (NIR, 700–1,700 nm) luminescent nanoparticles makes them valuable tools in various scientific and technological fields, from bioimaging to information security. However, the luminescence intensity of typical lanthanide-doped nanoparticles is significantly influenced by the efficiency of the sensitizer. The introduction of transition metal ions (such as Cr3+, Mn2+and Ni2+) can greatly enrich the library of lanthanide NIR luminescence nanoparticles. We have reported a new crystalline nanoparticle, Na3CrF6, for high-brightness NIR emission from lanthanide activators (such as Er3+, Tm3+, Yb3+or Nd3+). As an emerging luminescent material, a straightforward and scalable synthesis approach for these nanostructures holds promise for their broader application. Here we have refined and standardized the steps for transition metal-sensitized lanthanide luminescent nanoparticles, thereby establishing a library of advanced luminescent materials for researchers engaged in luminescent materials. The Protocol enables the precise preparation of chromium-, manganese- and nickel-trifluoroacetate, the synthesis of three types of transition metal-sensitized lanthanide nanoparticle and the fabrication of chromium-sensitized lanthanide homogeneous and heterogeneous nanostructure. Moreover, we provide verification protocols for each step’s output and guidelines for adjusting synthesis conditions. To aid in the reproducible synthesis of these nanoparticles, we also include a troubleshooting guide of the various stages. The estimated duration for synthesizing transition metal trifluoroacetate, transition metal-sensitized lanthanide nanoparticles and core–shell transition metal-sensitized lanthanide nanoparticles are ~70, 30 and 30 h, respectively. These procedures can be carried out by users with expertise in chemistry or materials science.",

Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of assembly intermediates illustrates how tRNAGln/Argorchestrates the recruitment of transcription and mRNA processing factors to vRNAP where it controls the transition to the preinitiation complex. This is achieved by an induced fit mechanism that internalizes anticodon base G36 into the anticodon stem, creating a noncanonical tRNA structure and selecting a defined tRNA modification pattern. The role of tRNA as an assembly chaperone extends to the pathogenic Mpox virus, which features a similar vRNAP.",

Consistently, Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment of PC cell lines increased ECD mRNA and protein levels, and AR knockdown (KD) reduced ECD expression. Bioinformatic analysis predicted three consensus androgen response elements in the ECD promoter, and DHT treatment increased AR occupancy at the ECD promoter, and enhanced ECD promoter activity. Enzalutamide treatment decreased ECD levels, and ECD knockout (KO) in PC cells reduced oncogenic traits, suggesting a functional role of ECD to maintain PC oncogenesis. ECD mRNA and protein are overexpressed in PC patient tissues, and its overexpression predicts shorter survival. Overexpression of ECD in PC cell lines enhanced the oncogenic traits in vitro and developed faster and larger highly proliferative xenograft tumors. RNA-seq analysis of mouse tumors revealed an increase in mRNA levels of several glycolytic genes. ECD associates with mRNA of key glycolytic genes and is required for their stability, consistent with our recent demonstration of ECD is an RNA binding protein. Higher glucose uptake and glycolysis was seen upon ECD overexpression in PC cells. Together, we demonstrate the role of a novel AR target gene ECD in PC tumorigenesis.",

We have previously shown thatTRIM29, also known asATDC, is transcriptionally regulated by TP63 in basal bladder cancers where it promotes invasive progression and metastasis, but the molecular events which promote invasion and metastasis downstream ofTRIM29remained poorly understood. Here we identify stimulation of bladder cancer migration as the specific role of TRIM29 during invasion. We show that TRIM29 physically interacts with K14+ intermediate filaments which, in turn, regulates focal adhesion stability. Further, we find that both K14 and the focal adhesion protein, ZYX are required for bladder cancer migration and invasion. Taken together, these results establish a role for TRIM29 in the regulation of cytoskeleton and focal adhesions during invasion and identify a pathway with therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "The strategic importance of metals found in deep-sea polymetallic nodules has spurred a surge in interest for their exploitation. However, nodules are known to incorporate radionuclides during their growth, so that any industrial processing would involve classifying them as naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM). As the start of deep-sea mining gets closer, concerns about elevated exposure to radiation that could result from the handling of nodules has recently been raised. In this study, we address this issue within the framework of radiation protection regulations. For the first time, we present estimates of effective doses associated with laboratory work and industrial-scale exploitation, transportation and metallurgical processing of polymetallic nodules. Estimates are based on an analysis of all long-lived radionuclides from the three natural decay chains of uranium-238, uranium-235 and thorium-232 and on radon exhalation rates from dry nodules. We show that effective doses for laboratory workplaces are well below the threshold of 1 millisievert per calendar year (mSv/a) for occupational exposure, even under the most conservative assumptions. Furthermore, we find that the effective doses for personnel on nodule transport vessels and metallurgical processing facilities may exceed the threshold in a conservative scenario. However, with standard radiation protection and mitigation measures common in other NORM-affected industries, effective doses can be kept well below the occupational exposure limit.",

    "abstract": "Imitation of cultural practices is ubiquitous in humans and often involves faithful copying of intransitive (i.e., non-object directed) gestures and societal norms which play a crucial role in human cumulative cultural evolution. Apart from learning these directly from a tutor, humans often learn passively as third-party observers from the interactions of two or more individuals. Whether third-party imitation has evolved outside humans remains unknown. In the current study, we investigated whether undomesticated blue-throated macaws (Ara glaucogularis) could imitate in a third-party setting. A naïve test group (N= 6) passively observed a conspecific demonstrator performing rare intransitive actions in response to specific human gestural commands. Directly afterwards, the observer received the same gestural commands and performance-contingent rewards. An equally naïve control group (N= 5) was tested correspondingly, in the absence of third-party demonstrations. The test group learned more target actions (mean = 4.16 versus mean = 2.2) in response to the specific commands, significantly faster and performed them more accurately than the control group. The test group also spontaneously imitated some of the actions even before they received any gestural commands or rewards. Our findings show that third-party imitation, even for intransitive actions, exists outside humans, allowing for rapid adaption to group specific behaviours and possibly cultural conventions in parrots.",

    "title": "Physiological responses in free-ranging Asian elephant populations living across human-production landscapes",
    "abstract": "Monitoring the physiology of elephants living in human-production landscapes has become increasingly important for understanding how they cope with various challenges that affect their overall fitness. We assessed physiological stress by measuring faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) levels and metabolic states using faecal triiodothyronine (fT3) across three free-ranging Asian elephant populations (one in Central India and two in Northeastern India) whose home ranges encompass varying extents of disturbance in human-production landscapes. We present landscape disturbance metrics to characterize variations in fragmentation and anthropogenic pressures across the study landscapes and use faecal carbon and nitrogen (C/N) ratio as a proxy for dietary quality, with higher C/N values indicating poorer-quality diets. Elephants living in more fragmented habitats in Central India had higher fGCM and lower fT3 levels compared to the Northeastern populations, as well as when compared (only fGCM levels) with a previously-studied Southern Indian elephant population. A positive relationship was observed between faecal C/N ratio and fGCM levels across the populations, except for the Central population. These findings suggest that elephants in highly fragmented landscapes and experiencing significant anthropogenic disturbances have (i) higher adrenal activity to cope with and (ii) reduced metabolic rates to conserve energy in emerging challenging contexts. While elephants may adapt to living in human-modified landscapes to some extent, they may experience high stress levels beyond a threshold of disturbance which can be physiologically costly. This warrants systematic assessments to evaluate how these biological costs impact their fitness, and a re-evaluation of conflict management practices.",

    "abstract": "Radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI) represents a severe complication of cranial radiotherapy, substantially diminishing patients’ quality of life. Unlike conventional brain injuries, RIBI evokes a unique chronic neuroinflammatory response that notably aggravates neurodegenerative processes. Despite significant progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms related to neuroinflammation, the specific and precise mechanisms that regulate neuroinflammation in RIBI and its associated toxicological effects remain largely unclear. Additionally, targeted neuroprotective strategies for RIBI are currently lacking. In this study, we systematically characterized the pathophysiology of RIBI using zebrafish (larvae/adults) and murine models. We established direct associations between neuronal damage and cognitive-behavioral deficits. Mechanistically, we proposed a ROS-mitochondrial-immune axis. Specifically, radiation-induced ROS lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in the leakage of mitochondrial DNA into the cytosol. This, in turn, activated the cGAS-STING pathway, thereby driving persistent microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Furthermore, we engineered a dual-function nanotherapeutic agent, Pep-Cu5.4O@H151. This agent integrates ultrasmall copper-based nanozymes (Cu5.4O) for ROS scavenging and H151 (a STING inhibitor) and is conjugated with peptides that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and target microglia. This nanoplatform exhibited excellent synergistic therapeutic efficacy by simultaneously neutralizing oxidative stress and blocking inflammatory cascades. Our research provided an in-depth analysis of radiation-induced neurotoxicity, clarifying the crucial ROS-mitochondrial-immune axis. Moreover, we have developed a precise therapeutic strategy on the basis of this mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Prokaryotes create adaptive immune memories by acquiring foreign DNA snippets, known as spacers, into the CRISPR array1. In type II CRISPR-Cas systems, the RNA-guided effector Cas9 also assists the acquisition machinery by selecting spacers fromprotospaceradjacentmotif (PAM)-flanked DNA2,3. Here, we uncover the first biological role for Cas9 that is independent of its dual RNA partners. Following depletion of crRNA and/or tracrRNA,NeisseriaapoCas9 stimulates spacer acquisition efficiency. Physiologically, Cas9 senses low levels of crRNA in cells with short CRISPR arrays – such as those undergoing array neogenesis or natural array contractions – and dynamically upregulates acquisition to quickly expand the small immune memory banks. As the CRISPR array expands, rising crRNA abundance in turn reduces apoCas9 availability, thereby dampening acquisition to mitigate autoimmunity risks associate with elevated acquisition. While apoCas9’s nuclease lobe alone suffices for stimulating acquisition, only full-length Cas9 responses to crRNA levels to boost acquisition in cells with low immunity depth. Finally, we show that this activity is evolutionarily conserved across multiple type II-C Cas9 orthologs. Altogether, we establish an auto-replenishing feedback mechanism in which apoCas9 safeguards CRISPR immunity depth by acting as both a crRNA sensor and a regulator of spacer acquisition.",

Despite the prevalence and importance of these structures, it is still unclear why initial component failures propagate disproportionately in some bridges but barely affect functionality in others4,5,6,7. Here we uncover and characterize the fundamental secondary resistance mechanisms that allow steel truss bridges to withstand the initial failure of any main component. These mechanisms differ substantially from the primary resistance mechanisms considered during the design of (undamaged) bridges. After testing a scaled-down specimen of a real bridge and using validated numerical models to simulate the failure of all main bridge components, we show how secondary resistance mechanisms interact to redistribute the loads supported by failed components to other parts of the structure. By studying the evolution of these mechanisms under increasing loads up to global failure, we are able to describe the conditions that enable their effective development. These findings can be used to enhance present bridge design and maintenance strategies, ultimately leading to safer transport networks.",

Bi-allelicDNA2mutations that reduce DNA2 concentrations cause a spectrum of primordial dwarfism disorders, including Seckel and Rothmund–Thomson-related syndromes5,6,7. By contrast, cancer cells frequently express high concentrations of DNA2 (refs.8,9,10,11). The mechanism that precludes cell proliferation in the absence of DNA2 and the molecular aetiology ofDNA2-linked diseases remain elusive. Here we used yeast and human cells to demonstrate thatDNA2suppresses homologous recombination-restarted replication and checkpoint activation at stalled DNA replication forks. Loss of this control mechanism upon degradation of DNA2 in human cells causes recombination-dependent DNA synthesis and build-up of RPA-bound single-stranded DNA in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Consequently, DNA2 deprivation triggers the DNA damage checkpoint and invariably leads to ATR–p21-dependent cell-cycle exit before mitosis. These findings explain whyDNA2is essential for cell proliferation and reveal that replication fork processing to restrict recombination is indispensable for avoiding cellular senescence. Stochastic entry into senescence stifles the proliferative potential of cells following the expression of a Seckel syndrome patient-derived DNA2 hypomorph or partial degradation of DNA2, providing a conceptual framework to explain global growth failure inDNA2-linked primordial dwarfism disorders.",

Here we establish a prudent planetary limit of around 1,460 (1,290–2,710) Gt of CO2storage through a risk-based, spatially explicit analysis of carbon storage in sedimentary basins. We show that only stringent near-term gross emissions reductions can lower the risk of breaching this limit before the year 2200. Fully using geologic storage for carbon removal caps the possible global temperature reduction to 0.7 °C (0.35–1.2 °C, including storage estimate and climate response uncertainty). The countries most robust to our risk assessment are current large-scale extractors of fossil resources.

    "abstract": "A key challenge in neuroscience is understanding how neurons in hundreds of interconnected brain regions integrate sensory inputs with previous expectations to initiate movements and make decisions1. It is difficult to meet this challenge if different laboratories apply different analyses to different recordings in different regions during different behaviours. Here we report a comprehensive set of recordings from 621,733 neurons recorded with 699 Neuropixels probes across 139 mice in 12 laboratories. The data were obtained from mice performing a decision-making task with sensory, motor and cognitive components. The probes covered 279 brain areas in the left forebrain and midbrain and the right hindbrain and cerebellum. We provide an initial appraisal of this brain-wide map and assess how neural activity encodes key task variables. Representations of visual stimuli transiently appeared in classical visual areas after stimulus onset and then spread to ramp-like activity in a collection of midbrain and hindbrain regions that also encoded choices. Neural responses correlated with impending motor action almost everywhere in the brain. Responses to reward delivery and consumption were also widespread. This publicly available dataset represents a resource for understanding how computations distributed across and within brain areas drive behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Metazoan development proceeds through a series of morphogenetic events that sculpt body plans and organ structures1,2. In the early embryo, these processes occur concurrently such that forces generated in neighbouring tissues can impose mechanical stresses on each other3,4,5, potentially disrupting development and consequently decreasing fitness. How organisms evolved mechanisms to mitigate inter-tissue mechanical conflicts remains unclear. Here, we combined phylogenetic survey, quantitative live imaging and functional mechanical perturbation to investigate mechanical stress management during gastrulation across the insect order of flies (Diptera). We identify two distinct cellular mechanisms that prevent tissue collision between the expanding head and trunk. In Cyclorrhapha, a monophyletic subgroup includingDrosophila melanogaster, active out-of-plane deformation of a transient epithelial fold, called the cephalic furrow, acts as a mechanical sink to pre-empt head–trunk collision. Genetic and optogenetic ablation of the cephalic furrow leads to accumulation of compressive stress, tissue buckling at the head–trunk boundary and late-stage embryonic defects in the head and nervous system. By contrast, the non-cyclorrhaphanChironomus ripariuslacks cephalic furrow formation and instead undergoes widespread out-of-plane division that reduces the duration and spatial extent of head expansion. Re-orienting head mitosis from in-plane to out-of-plane inDrosophilapartially suppresses tissue buckling, showing that it can function as an alternative mechanical sink. Our data suggest that mechanisms of mechanical stress management emerge and diverge in response to inter-tissue conflicts during early embryonic development.",

In the human brain, the prefrontal cortex undergoes age-related changes that can affect cognitive functioning later in life2. Here, using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS) and spatial transcriptomics, we identify gene-expression and genomic changes in the human prefrontal cortex across lifespan, from infancy to centenarian. snRNA-seq identified infant-specific cell clusters enriched for the expression of neurodevelopmental genes, as well as an age-associated common downregulation of cell-essential homeostatic genes that function in ribosomes, transport and metabolism across cell types. Conversely, the expression of neuron-specific genes generally remains stable throughout life. These findings were validated with spatial transcriptomics. scWGS identified two age-associated mutational signatures that correlate with gene transcription and gene repression, respectively, and revealed gene length- and expression-level-dependent rates of somatic mutation in neurons that correlate with the transcriptomic landscape of the aged human brain. Our results provide insight into crucial aspects of human brain development and ageing, and shed light on transcriptomic and genomic dynamics.",

However, little is known about how internal states and external cues are integrated to release appropriate behaviours at the correct moment during a social interaction, such as the transition from the appetitive to the consummatory phases of mating1,2. Here we identify a neural circuit in male mice that gates the onset of consummatory reproductive behaviours on contact with a mating partner. Stimulating MPOAEsr1∩Vgathypothalamic neurons promotes mounting of conspecifics and three-dimensional dummy objects3. We find that such mounting depends on mechanosensory but not visual cues. Through a large-scale electrophysiological screen, we identify neurons in the subparafascicular thalamic nucleus that nonlinearly integrate medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus (MPOA) and mechanosensory input to encode contact with a potential mate. Circuit tracing and perturbations demonstrated that this conjunctive coding occurs by means of convergent disinhibition from MPOA and excitation from the spinal trigeminal nucleus. Functional manipulations and calcium recordings showed these social-contact neurons, marked by parathyroid hormone 2, were essential for and able to promote mounting. These data indicate that subparafascicular thalamic nucleus-parathyroid hormone 2 neurons integrate internal drive with social touch to trigger mounting at opportune moments during mating. More generally, our findings uncover a brain mechanism whereby an internal state can attribute a social quality to a generic touch to initiate purposeful reproductive actions.",

Applying this technology to mouse embryogenesis and the postnatal mouse brain resulted in rich DNA–RNA bimodal tissue maps. These maps revealed the spatial context of known methylation biology and its interplay with gene expression. The concordance and distinction in spatial patterns of the two modalities highlighted a synergistic molecular definition of cell identity in spatial programming of mammalian development and brain function. By integrating spatial maps of mouse embryos at two different developmental stages, we reconstructed the dynamics that underlie mammalian embryogenesis for both the epigenome and transcriptome, revealing details of sequence-, cell-type- and region-specific methylation-mediated transcriptional regulation. This method extends the scope of spatial omics to include DNA cytosine methylation, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of tissue biology across development and disease.",

Here we show that an evolutionary novelty of fly embryos—the patterned embryonic invagination known as the cephalic furrow5,6,7—has a mechanical role duringDrosophilagastrulation. By integrating in vivo experiments and in silico simulations, we demonstrate that the head–trunk boundary of the embryo is under increased compressive stress due to the concurrent formation of mitotic domains and germ band extension and that the cephalic furrow counteracts these stresses, preventing mechanical instabilities during gastrulation. Then, by comparing the genetic patterning of species with and without the cephalic furrow, we find evidence that changes in the expression of the transcription factorbuttonheadare associated with the evolution of the cephalic furrow. These results suggest that the cephalic furrow may have evolved through the genetic stabilization of morphogenesis in response to the mechanical challenges of dipteran gastrulation. Together, our findings uncover empirical evidence for how mechanical forces can influence the evolution of morphogenetic innovations in early development.",

Mice were trained to indicate the location of a visual grating stimulus, which appeared on the left or right with a prior probability alternating between 0.2 and 0.8 in blocks of variable length. We found that mice estimate this prior probability and thereby improve their decision accuracy. Furthermore, we report that this subjective prior is encoded in at least 20% to 30% of brain regions that, notably, span all levels of processing, from early sensory areas (the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex) to motor regions (secondary and primary motor cortex and gigantocellular reticular nucleus) and high-level cortical regions (the dorsal anterior cingulate area and ventrolateral orbitofrontal cortex). This widespread representation of the prior is consistent with a neural model of Bayesian inference involving loops between areas, as opposed to a model in which the prior is incorporated only in decision-making areas. This study offers a brain-wide perspective on prior encoding at cellular resolution, underscoring the importance of using large-scale recordings on a single standardized task.",

Their envelopes contain at least ten different glycoproteins, which are necessary for host cell tropism, attachment and entry2. The best conserved among them, glycoprotein B (gB), is essential as it performs membrane fusion by undergoing extensive rearrangements from a prefusion to postfusion conformation. At present, there are no antiviral drugs targeting gB or neutralizing antibodies directed against its prefusion form, because of the difficulty in structurally determining and using this metastable conformation. Here we show the isolation of prefusion-specific nanobodies, one of which exhibits strong neutralizing and cross-species activity. By mutational stabilization we solved the herpes simplex virus 1 gB full-length prefusion structure, which allowed the bound epitope to be determined. Our analyses show the membrane-embedded regions of gB and previously unresolved structural features3,4, including a new fusion loop arrangement, providing insights into the initial conformational changes required for membrane fusion. Binding an epitope spanning three domains, proximal only in the prefusion state, the nanobody keeps wild-type HSV-2 gB in this conformation and enabled its native prefusion structure to be determined. This also indicates the mode of neutralization and an attractive avenue for antiviral interventions.",

Here we demonstrate a high-resolution 3D printing technology based on two-photon polymerization (2PP)11that is capable of fabricating large arrays of high-performance miniaturized 3D traps. We show that 3D-printed ion traps combine the advantages, such as strong radial confinement, of traditionally machined 3D traps with on-chip miniaturization. We trap calcium ions in 3D-printed ion traps with radial trap frequencies ranging from 2 MHz to 24 MHz. The tight confinement eases ion cooling requirements and allows us to implement high-quality Rabi oscillations with Doppler cooling only. Also, we demonstrate a two-qubit gate with a Bell-state fidelity of 0.978 ± 0.012.

The released arginine, in turn, induced expression of the type 3 secretion system inSalmonella, increasing its invasion of epithelial cells.C. albicansdeficient in arginine production was unable to increaseSalmonellavirulence. Arginine-producingC. albicansalso dampened the inflammatory response duringSalmonellainfection. Arginine supplementation in the absence ofC. albicansincreased the systemic spread ofSalmonellaand decreased the inflammatory response, phenocopying the presence ofC. albicans.

Here, using our approach for identifying functional GWAS risk variants showing allele-specific open chromatin, we systematically identified putative causal LOAD-risk variants in human induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-cell-derived neurons, astrocytes and microglia, and linked aPICALMLOAD-risk allele to a microglial-specific role ofPICALMin lipid droplet (LD) accumulation. Allele-specific open-chromatin mapping revealed functional risk variants for 26 LOAD-risk loci, mostly specific to microglia. At the microglial-specificPICALMlocus, the LOAD-risk allele of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs10792832 reduced transcription factor (PU.1) binding andPICALMexpression, impairing the uptake of amyloid beta (Aβ) and myelin debris. Notably, microglia carrying thePICALMrisk allele showed transcriptional enrichment of pathways for cholesterol synthesis and LD formation. Genetic and pharmacological perturbations of microglia further established a causal link between reducedPICALMexpression, LD accumulation and phagocytosis deficits. Our work elucidates the selective LOAD vulnerability in microglia at thePICALMlocus through detrimental LD accumulation, providing a neurobiological basis that can be exploited for developing clinical interventions.",

The glycaemic actions of MeAVMHneurons occur independently of adrenal or pancreatic glucoregulatory hormones. Using whole-body virus tracing, we identify a polysynaptic connection from MeA to the liver that promotes the rapid synthesis of glucose by hepatic gluconeogenesis. Repeated stress exposure disrupts MeA control of blood glucose, resulting in diabetes-like dysregulation of glucose homeostasis.

Here, to address this limitation, we developed protein affinity to DNA by in vitro transcription and RNA sequencing (PADIT-seq), with which we comprehensively assayed the binding preferences of six TFs to all possible ten-base-pair DNA sequences, detecting hundreds of novel, lower-affinity binding sites. The expanded repertoire of lower-affinity binding sites revealed that nucleotides flanking high-affinity DNA binding sites create overlapping lower-affinity sites that together modulate TF genomic occupancy in vivo. We propose a model in which TF binding is not determined by individual binding sites, but rather by the sum of multiple, overlapping binding sites. The overlapping binding model explains how competition between paralogous TFs for shared high-affinity binding sites is determined by flanking nucleotides that create differential numbers of overlapping, lower-affinity binding sites. Critically, the model transforms our understanding of noncoding-variant effects, revealing how single nucleotide changes simultaneously alter multiple overlapping sites to additively influence gene expression and human traits, including diseases.",

Accordingly, ABHD18 converts CL into monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) in vitro, and its inactivation in cells and mice results in a shift to nCL in serum and tissues. Notably,ABHD18deactivation rescues the mitochondrial defects in cells and the morbidity and mortality in mice associated with Barth syndrome. This rare genetic disease is characterized by the build-up of MLCL resulting from inactivating mutations inTAFAZZIN(TAZ), which encodes the final enzyme in the CL-remodelling cascade1. We also identified a selective, covalent, small-molecule inhibitor of ABHD18 that rescuesTAZmutant phenotypes in fibroblasts from human patients and in fish embryos.

Through direct and comprehensive measurements of carbon and nitrogen labelling in both cortex and glioma tissues, we identify profound metabolic transformations. In the human cortex, glucose carbons fuel essential physiological processes, including tricarboxylic acid cycle oxidation and neurotransmitter synthesis. Conversely, gliomas downregulate these processes and scavenge alternative carbon sources such as amino acids from the environment, repurposing glucose-derived carbons to generate molecules needed for proliferation and invasion. Targeting this metabolic rewiring in mice through dietary amino acid modulation selectively alters glioblastoma metabolism, slows tumour growth and augments the efficacy of standard-of-care treatments.

Here we present genome-wide data from 555 ancient individuals, including 359 samples from Slavic contexts from as early as the seventh centuryce. Our data demonstrate large-scale population movement from Eastern Europe during the sixth to eighth centuries, replacing more than 80% of the local gene pool in Eastern Germany, Poland and Croatia. Yet, we also show substantial regional heterogeneity as well as a lack of sex-biased admixture, indicating varying degrees of cultural assimilation of the autochthonous populations. Comparing archaeological and genetic evidence, we find that the change in ancestry in Eastern Germany coincided with a change in social organization, characterized by an intensification of inter- and intra-site genetic relatedness and patrilocality. On the European scale, it appears plausible that the changes in material culture and language between the sixth and eighth centuries were connected to these large-scale population movements.",

    "abstract": "Negative-stranded segmented RNA viruses (NSVs) employ a cap-snatching mechanism for transcription, which makes cap-dependent endonuclease (CEN) an attractive target for drug development. Pathogenic arenaviruses pose a serious threat to humans, yet no approved treatments exist, underscoring the importance of discovering novel compounds targeting arenaviral CENs. Therefore, this study aimed to identify novel CEN inhibitors for arenaviruses and investigate their antiviral mechanisms. A high-throughput screening system based on enzymatic activity of CEN was established for discovering inhibitors of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Several hit compounds were screened from a vast natural product library, and then evaluated for both toxicity and inhibition through cellular and animal experiments. One candidate compound was finally identified, and its mechanism of action on CEN was elucidated through simulation analysis and biochemical studies. Moreover, its broad-spectrum effects were investigated among pathogenic arenaviruses as well as representative NSVs. Consequently, salvianolic acid A (SAA) fromSalvia miltiorrhizawas identified as a promising compound that effectively inhibited LCMV infection and significantly reduced the viral load via intravenous administration. It was shown to bind to the active pocket of arenaviral CENs while chelating their metal ions through its acid carboxyl group, acting in a substrate-competitive manner. Additionally, SAA exhibited broad-spectrum inhibition of pathogenic arenaviruses as well as representative viruses from the orderBunyavirales. This study identified SAA as a novel CEN inhibitor, particularly for pathogenic arenaviruses, showcasing its promise for antiviral drug development.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLack of reliable biomarkers for early detection and monitoring contributes to the poor prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), as the current clinical marker, CA19-9, lacks adequate specificity and sensitivity.MethodsSerum concentrations of ALPPL2-positive and THBS2-positive exosomes were measured using an ExoView assay in two cohorts: a cohort of 219 subjects, including non-disease controls and patients with early- or late-stage PDAC, and a longitudinal cohort of 26 patients with advanced PDAC undergoing treatment.ResultsExosomal ALPPL2 and THBS2 distinguished non-cancer cases from PDAC with high accuracy; area under the curve (AUC) values = 0.983, 0.993, and 0.983 for ALPPL2, THBS2, and the dual marker combination, respectively. Additionally, changes in the concentrations of ALPPL2+and THBS2+exosomes strongly correlated with radiographic tumor size changes during treatment in both CA19-9-elevated (p= 0.016 and 0.014 for ALPPL2 and THBS2, respectively) and non-elevated patients (p= 0.003 and 0.006 for ALPPL2 and THBS2, respectively).ConclusionsSerum exosomal ALPPL2 and THBS2 can accurately discriminate patients with PDAC from individuals with non-cancerous conditions and healthy controls.

    "abstract": "The clinical application of combination chemotherapy with cisplatin is unsatisfactory for most pancreatic cancer patients with wild-typeBRCA1/2orPALB2due to resistance. Genes associated with cisplatin resistance in patients withoutBRCA1/2orPALB2mutations should be pursued. Through bioinformatics analysis, we found that Myotrophin (MTPN) expression was correlated with that of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), a protein involved in the regulation of cisplatin sensitivity. Immunohistochemistry revealed that MTPN was more highly expressed in human pancreatic cancer tissues than in normal tissues. MTPN promoted the malignant biological behaviors of pancreatic cancer (PC) cells and activated the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. Furthermore, MTPN was found to induce cisplatin resistance in PC cells and upregulate BRCA1/2 while promoting DNA repair. The enhancing effects of MTPN on cisplatin resistance and BRCA1/2 up-regulation were abolished by an inhibitor of IκBα phosphorylation. These studies suggested that MTPN may increase cisplatin resistance by activating IκBα to regulate BRCA1/2 expression. In summary, targeting MTPN could be a potential therapeutic strategy, as MTPN knockdown increased the sensitivity to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer with wild-typeBRCA1/2.",

    "abstract": "Nucleotide metabolism is essential for fundamental cellular functions such as growth, repair and proliferation. Emerging evidence suggests that metabolic pathways also influence programmed cell death (PCD), though the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. One model organism that has provided key insights into the regulation of PCD isCaenorhabditis elegans(C. elegans). In this nematode, apoptosis is often initiated through asymmetric cell division (ACD), a process that unequally distributes fate determinants between daughter cells to produce a larger surviving cell and a smaller cell destined for apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate that the simultaneous disruption of PCD and ACD leads to aberrant cell survival and the formation of extra hypodermal cells. Through a genetic screen in thegrp-1ACD mutant background, we identifiedpyr-1as a regulator of PCD.pyr-1encodes theC. eleganscarbamoyl-phosphate synthetase/aspartate transcarbamoylase/dihydroorotase (CAD) enzyme which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, producing uridine 5’-monophosphate (UMP). UMP is a critical metabolite for the synthesis of nucleotides, lipids and carbohydrates. Genetic analysis of UMP metabolic pathways, combined with exogenous nucleoside supplementation, confirms that UMP availability is essential for PYR-1-mediated PCD. Loss ofgrp-1induces cellular stress by disrupting fate determinant partitioning during ACD, whereaspyr-1mutations cause metabolic stress through UMP depletion. While both mutations independently activate autophagy, they function redundantly to upregulate the mitochondrial chaperonehsp-6. Knockdown of autophagy-related genes andhsp-6reveals that these pathways serve as compensatory mechanisms to protect against cell death in thepyr-1; grp-1double mutants. Collectively, our findings establish a direct link between metabolism and cell death, demonstrating how UMP availability and proper ACD coordinate apoptotic regulation and developmental outcomes. This study highlights the intricate interplay between metabolic homeostasis and PCD, providing new insights into the metabolic control of cell fate decisions.",

    "abstract": "Tumors evolve to avoid immune destruction and establish an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Syngeneic mouse tumor models are critical for understanding tumor immune evasion and testing cancer immunotherapy. Derived from established mouse tumor cell lines that can already evade the immune system, these models cannot simulate early phases of immunoediting during initial tumorigenesis. We developed a syngeneic mouse teratoma model derived from noncancerous mouse embryonic stem cells and conducted a genome-wide CRISPR screen to identify genes that impact early phases of cancer immunoediting. We found that loss of pro-apoptotic tumor suppressor genes, includingTrp53, increased necrosis in teratomas, releasing APOE lipid particles into the extracellular milieu. Infiltrating T cells drawn to tumor necrotic regions accumulated lipids and became dysfunctional. Blocking lipid uptake in T cells or reducing necrosis in teratomas by inactivating the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) restored immunosurveillance. Because mouse teratomas were highly enriched for brain tissues, we next examined the tumor-immune interaction in human glioblastoma (GBM). Indeed, infiltrating T cells in TP53-mutated human GBM accumulated APOE and were dysfunctional. Anti-APOE and anti-PDCD1 antibodies synergistically boosted anti-GBM immunity and prolonged survival in mice. Our results link mPTP-mediated tumor necrosis to immune evasion and suggest that targeting the uptake of lipids released by necrotic tumor cells by infiltrating immune cells can enhance cancer immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The “omnigenic” hypothesis postulates that the polygenic effects of common variants on a typical complex trait coalesce on relatively few core genes throughtrans-effects on their expression. Our aim was to identify core genes for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) by testing for association with genome-wide aggregatedtrans-effects (GATE) scores for gene expression in a large genetic dataset (5267/4909 SLE cases/controls). SLE was strongly associated with upregulation of expression of eight interferon-stimulated genes driven by sharedtrans-effects. We estimate thattrans-effects on interferon signaling account for 9% of the total genetic effect on SLE risk. Outside this pathway, GATE analysis detected twenty putative core genes for SLE. Direct protein measurements for these genes were strongly associated with SLE in UK Biobank. Two putative core genes (TNFRSF17,TNFRSF13B) encode receptors (BCMA, TACI) expressed on B cells; their ligands (BAFF, APRIL) are targeted by drugs licensed or in development for SLE. Four genes (PDCD1,LAG3,TNFRSF9,CD27) encode receptors that have been characterized as immune checkpoints, and three (CD5L,SIGLEC1,CXCL13) are biomarkers of SLE disease activity. These results provide genetic support for existing drug targets in SLE (interferon signaling, BAFF/APRIL signaling) and identify other possible therapeutic targets including immune checkpoint receptors.",

Endomyocardial biopsies were performed consecutively in 127 HF patients, and mitochondrial morphology data were obtained from 111 patients by electron microscopy. The patients were divided into three groups according to mitochondrial area quartiles (fission [Q1, area ≤ 0.119 μm2,n= 27], normal [Q2/Q3, 0.120 μm2≤ area ≤ 0.178 μm2,n= 55], and fusion [Q4, area ≥ 0.179 μm2,n= 28]). In the fission group, the serum N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were significantly higher, and patients with HF and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction were more common, than in the other groups. A multivariate logistic regression model showed that diabetes mellitus was independently associated with placement in the fission group (odds ratio: 2.835, 95%confidence interval [CI]: 1.037–7.752). A Kaplan–Meier curve analysis showed that the prognosis was significantly poorer in the fission group than in the other groups, and a multivariate Cox regression model revealed fission to be an independent predictor of 1500-day mortality (hazard ratio: 4.365, 95%CI: 1.198–15.909).

Therefore, a total of 1342 adults without hypertension at baseline and provided at least two survey data from 1997 to 2018 were included. Dietary information was collected by three consecutive 24-h recalls combined with household food inventory, and long-term diet quality was evaluated by the CHEI. Hypertension was defined as DBP ≥ 90 mmHg, SBP ≥ 140 mmHg, or using antihypertensive medication. Cox proportional hazard models were applied to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of CHEI and new-onset hypertension. A total of 557 new hypertensive events were observed during 12851.5 person-years of follow-up. Compared with individuals in the first quartile of CHEI score, the HR of hypertension was 0.49 (95% CI: 0.38-0.63) in the fourth quartile. Restricted cubic spline analysis displayed an L-shaped non-linear association between CHEI score and hypertension risk. Increased intake of whole grains, fruits, dairy, soybeans, fish/seafood, and eggs, and decreased intake of red meat and sodium, were associated with lower risk of hypertension, with HRs (95% CIs) of whole grains (0.86, 0.78–0.95), fruits (0.70, 0.60–0.81), dairy (0.85, 0.75–0.96), soybeans (0.83, 0.75–0.92), fish/seafood (0.87, 0.79–0.95), eggs (0.87, 0.79–0.96), red meat (0.83, 0.74–0.93), and sodium (0.77, 0.69–0.85), respectively. In conclusion, higher dietary quality assessed by the CHEI was associated with a lower risk of hypertension, indicating that adhering to a healthy diet in accordance with DGC might be beneficial for preventing hypertension.",

Goreisan (GRS) is a traditional herbal formulation; its component attenuates cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. This study aimed to investigate the effect of GRS on the pathophysiology of HFpEF. Administration of a high fat diet (HFD, 60% fat) and N-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME, 0.5 g/L in drinking water) increased heart and lung weights in C57BL/6 mice and GRS (5.9 mg/kcal) reduced them without changes in blood pressure. GRS attenuated HFD/L-NAME-induced increases in left ventricular wall thickness and E/A and E/E’, indices of diastolic dysfunction. GRS decreased cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area in HFD/L-NAME-treated mice. Mechanistically, it suppressed the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), in HFD/L-NAME-treated hearts. In addition, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry demonstrated that HFD/L-NAME decreased and GRS increased 73 proteins in the heart. Among them, GRS prevented HFD/L-NAME-induced decrease in inhibitor of β-catenin and T-cell factor (ICAT), a negative regulator of cardiac hypertrophy. Consistently, β-catenin, an ICAT target, exhibited the opposite change. In in vitro experiments, GRS directly decreased β-catenin in isoproterenol (ISO)-treated cardiomyocytes, accompanied by a decrease in cardiomyocyte surface area. Overexpression of ICAT also suppressed ISO-induced increases in β-catenin, phosphorylated ERK, and cardiomyocyte surface area. Among GRS ingredients, cinnamaldehyde and alisol B 23-acetate attenuated ISO-induced increases in β-catenin and cardiomyocyte surface area. In conclusion, GRS attenuates cardiac hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction via ICAT-β-catenin/ERK axis. GRS is a potential herbal formulation for the treatment of HFpEF.",

However, the rational interphase design under fast charging conditions remains difficult. Here we explore a series of pyran-based electrolytes with various substitutional anions under a fast charging condition and observe weakly Li+-associating anions facilitating uniform lithium plating under a fast charging condition. We demonstrate lithium metal batteries achieving a 5–70% state of charge (SoC) within 12 min over 350 repeated cycles at a 4C (8.4 mA cm−2) charging rate, as well as high-energy designs delivering projected energy densities of 386 Wh kg−1reaching a 10–80% SoC within 17 min over 180 cycles. We propose that the improved fast charging performance is in tandem with the ability of the weakly Li+associating anions to suppress inorganic species clustering within the solid–electrolyte interphase and demonstrate the potential for electrolyte advancement based on the proposed mechanism.",

Compared with the wealth of knowledge on gene regulation, our understanding of metabolic programs operating during embryogenesis is limited. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has the potential to map the distribution of metabolites across embryo development. Here we established uMAIA, an analytical framework for the joint analysis of large MSI datasets, which enables the construction of multidimensional metabolomic atlases. Employing this framework, we mapped the four-dimensional (4D) distribution of over a hundred lipids at micrometric resolution inDanio rerioembryos. We discovered metabolic trajectories that unfold in concert with morphogenesis and revealed spatially organized biochemical coordination overlooked by bulk measurements. Interestingly, lipid mapping revealed unexpected distributions of sphingolipid and triglyceride species, suggesting their involvement in pattern establishment and organ development. Our approach empowers a new generation of whole-organism metabolomic atlases and enables the discovery of spatially organized metabolic circuits.",

    "abstract": "T cells recognize antigens and induce specialized gene expression programs (GEPs), enabling functions like proliferation, cytotoxicity and cytokine production. Traditionally, different T cell classes are thought to exhibit mutually exclusive responses, including TH1, TH2 and TH17 programs. However, single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed a continuum of T cell states without clearly distinct subsets, necessitating new analytical frameworks. Here, we introduce T-CellAnnoTator (TCAT), a pipeline that improves T cell characterization by simultaneously quantifying predefined GEPs capturing activation states and cellular subsets. Analyzing 1,700,000 T cells from 700 individuals spanning 38 tissues and five disease contexts, we identify 46 reproducible GEPs reflecting core T cell functions including proliferation, cytotoxicity, exhaustion and effector states. We experimentally demonstrate new activation programs and apply TCAT to characterize activation GEPs that predict immune checkpoint inhibitor response across multiple tumor types.

    "title": "Microbes on the menu",
    "abstract": "Bacteria and fungi can augment the flavour, composition and sustainability of foods, but more research is needed to push microbial foods — and consumer palates — to new heights. Microbes have been used in the production of food for thousands of years. Fermentation of dairy, plants and meat was historically used to improve the taste, nutritional composition and shelf life of the original product. These traditional applications are still widely used today in the production of cheese and yogurt, kimchi and sauerkraut, wine and beer, and myriad other food and drink. Fermented foods naturally have probiotic qualities, increased bioavailability of nutrients and health-promoting compounds such as vitamins, antioxidants and polyunsaturated fatty acids1. By deploying microbes in unexpected applications, for example to transform food or plant waste into food2,3, or engineering bacteria and yeast with novel capabilities that tailor flavour or nutritional composition1, researchers are starting to show that we have only scratched the surface when it comes to the potential of microbes in food production. To unlock this potential, studies should be directed towards better understanding the microbial dynamics in fermented foods, how to creatively deploy these microbes to yield new flavours and nutritional benefits, and towards improving the uptake and acceptance of microbial foods by producers and consumers alike. A logical starting place is the microbial ecology and taxonomic diversity associated with traditional fermented foods. Though the fermentations that yield cheeses, chocolates and other foods have been in practice by humans for millennia, in many cases the ecological and chemical dynamics underlying the complex, multi-kingdom communities remain poorly understood. For example, kefir — a milk product resulting from fermentation by a community of up to 50 species of lactic and acetic acid bacteria and yeasts — has been produced for at least 3,500 years, but the underlying ecological mechanisms remained poorly resolved4. A multi-omics investigation of the kefir microbial community revealed temporal interactions and metabolic crosstalk that enabled the community to remain stable even as the conditions in the surrounding environment shifted dramatically over the course of fermentation4. This ecological strategy proves beneficial for the kefir microbial consortium, not to mention the humans interested in making more kefir, as it ensures a complete inoculum is ready for the next fermentation cycle. Kefir aside, this type of inquiry deepens our understanding of microbial community dynamics in general. A more robust understanding of the ecophysiology of these food systems is required before researchers can put them to more creative — and delicious — uses. In this issue ofNature Microbiology, Gopaulchan and colleaguesfocused on chocolate. Though chocolate has been produced and consumed for more than 3,000 years, the most important step remains the least well understood: the fermentation. During this step, microbes on raw seeds produce pyrazines and aldehydes that impart nutty, floral and fruity tastes and therefore shape the flavour profile of the chocolate. The researchers used metagenomics, metabolomics and metabolic modelling to determine the composition and functional attributes of the microbes present in Colombian cocoa farms and fermentation facilities, allowing them to triangulate the bacterial and fungal players that contribute to the flavour attributes prized in premium chocolate. From these results, the researchers created a defined microbial consortium composed of the five bacteria and four fungi that are key players in the fermentation process and are associated with fine flavour. When inoculated into controlled fermentations of lower-quality cocoa beans, a trained chocolate tasting panel agreed that the defined consortium yielded a product that mirrored the flavour profile of finer chocolates in a blind taste test. The transformation from cocoa bean to chocolate bar can be a logistically complicated, multistep process that relies on crops grown predominantly in the global south, followed by shipping and processing that largely occurs in the global north. Today’s chocolate industry generates many billions of dollars in revenue per year. As pointed out by Pablo Cruz-Morales in aNews & Viewsaccompanying the Article by Gopaulchan and colleagues, a better understanding of the chocolate fermentation process and the use of designer microbial consortia has many benefits. For example, this could assist producers in the creation of higher-grade products that would ultimately fetch higher prices on the global market. This strategy could funnel more income to those who typically do the lion’s share of work but reap the least profit. At the same time, more research will be needed to ensure that the deployment of such microbial technologies avoids the exploitation of labourers and the tropical rainforest land on which most beans are grown. In the case of chocolate, microbes can be used to make an already delicious product even more so. In a recently published paper, Maini Rekdal and colleagues took a similar approach, but with the goal of understanding how the fermenting microbe could be co-opted to turn food waste back into something edible. They focused their study on red oncom, a traditional Indonesian fermented food made from byproducts of soy milk production. Their analysis illustrated how the oncom transformation is facilitated by a single microbe, the fungusNeurospora intermedia, and its ability to turn soy milk waste into an edible, nutritious staple food. Maini Rekdal and colleagues went on to inoculateN. intermediainto other food byproducts that would otherwise be thrown away and found that the fungus could transform leftover fruit and vegetable pulp into edible food. A panel of tasters agreed that the resulting products were positively perceived foods2. These studies demonstrate the potential of microbes to transform food. But microbes can also be engineered to make food from scratch. With some genetic tinkering, microbes can turn products that were never edible into food. A Review published earlier this year synthesized how the fermentation of lignocellulose-based waste products (such as straw and wood) can be processed by yeasts to yield protein- and vitamin-rich extracts that could be a potential solution to malnutrition3. As Choi and colleagues argue, these microbial foods have easily digestible biomass with protein levels similar to animal meat, along with vitamins and other essential nutrients, all made via production pipelines that put less strain on the environment. Although it is clear that microbes have the potential to reduce the carbon footprint of the food industry, the challenge with many applications comes with making the resulting product palatable to consumers who are not familiar with oncom or other products synthesized from scratch by an engineered microbe. Technological advances will undoubtedly push microbes ever further in terms of their creative potential. But will the average person have any interest in eating a bacteria-based burger? Among the biggest hurdles towards more widespread adoption of microbial foods is consumer acceptance. Whether or not people will try new foods or accept them into their regular practices is based on the interplay of taste, health, familiarity and social norms5. Our eating habits are hard to break. Recent research has shown that consumer acceptance of alternative proteins such as cultured meat is relatively low, but there are many strategies that can circumvent this resistance, such as explaining taste, health and environmental benefits. Microbes can extend the shelf life of foods, imbue them with added nutritional value, and in many cases offer a more sustainable and energy efficient means of production. Whether cured, fermented, upcycled or bioengineered, someone needs to champion the research and consumption of microbial foods — and perhaps it should be microbiologists. Graham, A.

Photorespiratory intermediates such as serine and others may serve as sources of C1units, but it is unclear to what degree this happens in vivo, whether altered photorespiration changes flux to C1metabolism, and if so through which intermediates. To clarify these questions, we quantified carbon flux from photorespiration to C1metabolism using13CO2labelling and isotopically non-stationary metabolic flux analysis inArabidopsis thalianaunder different O2concentrations which modulate photorespiration. The results revealed that ~5.8% of assimilated carbon passes to C1metabolism under ambient photorespiratory conditions, but this flux greatly decreases under limited photorespiration. Furthermore, the primary carbon flux from photorespiration to C1metabolism is through serine. Our results provide fundamental insight into how photorespiration is integrated into C1metabolism, with possible implications for C1metabolic response to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Strategies for achieving net-zero emissions in municipal solid waste (MSW) management are crucial for a sustainable society, but insights that can guide global policy-making are still scarce. Here we provide a holistic view on this topic on a global scale. We first evaluated the spatiotemporal differences in global and national MSW-related emissions in 195 countries or regions between 1980 and 2022, and determined the spatiotemporal heterogeneity and drivers of global and national MSW-related greenhouse gas emissions. Then we performed prospective scenario-based simulations and found that all countries can achieve net zero in MSW management by 2100, but tailored measures are needed. We finally explored the strategies and challenges associated with achieving net zero via 1,024 scenarios while considering the combination of several measures from a local perspective. The results suggest that most developing countries should adjust their treatment measures and/or upgrade their technologies, whereas developed regions can achieve net zero with a single measure, particularly recycling, which has substantial mitigation potential. These insights can help to develop localized MSW management strategies for different countries and eventually contribute to achieving the net-zero target globally.",

    "abstract": "Divergent synthesis approaches generate all isomers of a molecule, but typically focus on single-dimensional selectivity control. The more challenging two-dimensional divergent synthesis dictating two types of selectivity to achieve all four isomers has recently received some attention. As such, three-dimensional divergent synthesis through dictation of three types of selectivity to prepare eight isomers or analogues is very challenging. Here we report a catalyst-controlled three-dimensional divergent protocol for the synthesis of eight types of diaryl allyl skeleton (through combinations ofE/ZandR/Sstereochemistry and 1,1-/1,3-substitution patterns) from the reaction of alkynes and heteroarenes. Good geometric selectivity, regioselectivity and enantioselectivity are observed for the hydroheteroarylation process of internal alkynes with indolizines via Pd and Rh catalysis. Experimental data and density functional theory calculations reveal that the Pd and Rh catalysts have differing mechanistic pathways for the hydroarylation of the internal alkynes and corresponding allene intermediates.",

    "title": "Role of β-Arrestin 2 in the antinociceptive and side effect profile of morphine and the novel mu opioid receptor agonists, kurkinorin and kurkinol",
    "abstract": "The development of safer mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonists with reduced side effects is a key focus of pain research. Some studies have suggested that MOR agonists with reduced β-arrestin 2 (βArr2) signaling (i.e. G-protein biased agonists) may have greater therapeutic windows. However, there have been a several conflicting reports, and it is not clear what role, if any, βArr2 signaling plays in MOR-mediated analgesia, tolerance, or side effects. Therefore, we used βArr2 knockout mice to systematically investigate the causal role of βArr2 signaling in antinociception, antinociceptive tolerance, respiratory depression, constipation, and reward induced by morphine and the two novel MOR agonists, kurkinorin and kurkinol. Kurkinorin and kurkinol exhibited potent antinociceptive effects that were reversed by MOR knockout. Unlike morphine or kurkinorin, our most G-protein biased agonist, kurkinol, showed no significant tolerance after seven days of ~2×ED50dosing. However, in a chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain model, all three compounds were ineffective after 20 days of ~ED50dosing, indicative of tolerance. All compounds exhibited significant MOR-dependent side effects, though kurkinorin had reduced gastrointestinal and respiratory depressive effects compared to morphine despite exhibiting less G-protein bias. Knockout of βArr2 significantly increased antinociceptive potency for morphine and kurkinorin but not kurkinol, and otherwise had no significant impact on tolerance or any side effect tested. These results largely suggest that βArr2 signaling does not drive MOR-mediated antinociceptive tolerance, respiratory depression, constipation, or reward and do not support the development of G-protein biased compounds as a broadly effective strategy to reduce side effects.",

Univariable logistic regression models addressed indication for adjuvant radiation therapy. Multivariable logistic regression models included the most informative, statistically significant preoperative predictors. Harrell’s concordance index (c-index) quantified accuracy after 2000 bootstrap resamples for internal validation.ResultsOf 5691 patients, 2137 (38%) had indication for adjuvant radiation therapy according to current EAU guidelines (2025). Indication for adjuvant radiation therapy was associated with higher prostate volume (> 45 cm3and 25–45 cm3) and advanced tumor characteristics, namely higher prostate-specific antigen value (>20 ng/ml and 10-20 ng/ml), advanced clinical tumor stage (cT3/4 and cT2), lower number of sampled biopsy cores (≤ 12), higher proportion of positive cores (continuous), and higher Gleason Grade Group in biopsy (5, 4, and 3).

    "title": "Face perception: a window into the social mind",
    "abstract": "This editorial introduces a broad Collection of works highlighting the central role of faces, the richest and most complex of social stimuli, in human behaviour. The Collection covers work from various areas of psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience on different aspects of face perception: The development of face perception, the underlying cognitive and neural mechanisms of face perception, the role of faces in social interaction, how neurological or psychiatric conditions can affect face perception, as well as face perception in human–machine interactions involving artificial agents with face-like features. This body of work underscores the profound impact of faces on social interaction, aiming to promote dialogue among different disciplines and inspire future research in this vibrant research domain. Faces are central to human social life and represent a highly relevant social stimulus, both complex and uniquely rich in critical information that can be inferred from them. For instance, faces convey emotional states, as well as intentions and attentional focus, guiding us in countless interactions from infancy into adulthood. Indeed, extensive research highlights faces as a primary source of social information1,2. Our ability to detect, recognise, interpret and react to facial cues shapes our social experiences, facilitating cooperation and communication that is crucial for navigating a complex social environment3,4. The study of face perception has consistently revealed its multifaceted nature, from basic sensory processing to more sophisticated interpretations influenced by social, emotional, and cultural contexts. The richness of information communicated by faces is mirrored by the wealth of contributions in this Collection, covering different characteristics of face perception approached through various methodologies. Bringing together cutting-edge research from psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience, this Collection covers recent work on how we process faces and why this class of stimuli matters for our social experiences. The articles in this Collection present several interconnected perspectives, as illustrated by some examples briefly reported below. Firstly, the developmental aspects of face perception are addressed by examining how these abilities emerge and mature over time. For instance, Rigato and colleagues5assessed the visual preferences of infants and their longitudinal associations with emotional reactivity, emphasising the significance of face perception in emotional development. Lesinger and colleagues6focused on the neurodevelopmental trajectory of face-processing abilities, documenting the right-hemispheric lateralisation of face network connectivity from infancy to adulthood. Gilad-Gutnik and colleagues7conducted a study on children treated later in life for congenital cataract and proposed a new hypothesis based on visual acuity in newborns that might determine the development of congenital prosopagnosia. These contributions illustrate how behavioural and neural indices of face perception emerge early and jointly contribute to developing social and emotional competencies. Secondly, clinical and neurological perspectives enrich our knowledge of face perception by examining impairments in face-processing mechanisms in different populations. Halder and colleagues8investigated congenital prosopagnosia using a binocular rivalry paradigm, revealing atypical focus on local rather than holistic cues during face processing. Metternich and colleagues9examined patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, highlighting subtle but meaningful deficits in dynamic facial emotion recognition, which are often missed by standard assessments. Furthermore, research on individuals with varying levels of autistic traits10, as well as individuals with Williams syndrome11, shows how neurodevelopmental and individual differences shape face processing and the perception of gaze direction, offering valuable insights for both theoretical models and potential interventions. In this regard, Williams and colleagues12showed that individuals with higher autistic traits, when judging gaze direction, were more affected by the presence of a face mask, which reduced the availability of spatial cues such as the nose and mouth. Thirdly, research on emotional and affective processing offers fresh insights into how humans recognise complex affective states from faces and respond to them. Montalti and colleagues13, using a multi-face flanker-go/no-go task, showed that emotional faces influence behaviour only when relevant to the task. Tessier and colleagues14investigated facial representations combining pain and negative emotions, revealing sophisticated perceptual integration mechanisms that guide social responses and empathy. This line of research emphasises the complex interplay between perceptual sensitivity, emotional relevance, and individual/contextual factors, highlighting the fundamental role of facial stimuli in emotional communication. Further contributions examined the cognitive and perceptual mechanisms underlying face recognition and identity discrimination. Leong and colleagues15assessed the relative contributions of holistic versus featural processing, advancing theoretical debates on how facial identities are encoded and retrieved from memory. Kasahara and colleagues16investigated the boundaries of self-face recognition using real-time morphing techniques, offering new insights into the dynamic nature of self-awareness. Together, these studies expand our understanding of the processes critical for social identification and personal interaction. And again, social-cognitive dimensions have been further investigated through studies examining, for example, implicit biases, dominance perception, and interactions with artificial agents. Cheung and colleagues17explored implicit biases in trustworthiness judgments across groups of different ethnicities, underscoring key implications for social cognition and intergroup dynamics. From a developmental perspective, Galusca and colleagues18investigated the sensitivity of toddlers to dominance traits from facial cues, highlighting the evolutionary and experiential roots of face perception and person impression. Momen and colleagues19showed that beliefs about the mental states of robots modulate social perception, with consequences for human–robot interaction. Lorenzoni and colleagues20examined how linguistic identity shapes gaze-mediated orienting, demonstrating the interplay between social categorisation and social attention. Overall, these studies reflect the multifaceted nature of face perception and how it can be influenced by implicit attitudes, developmental factors, perceived agency, and group membership. Finally, methodological innovations and technological applications are also well represented in this Collection, offering powerful new tools to advance face perception research. Accordingly, Mayrand and colleagues21demonstrated the potential of using dual mobile eye-tracking to study mutual gaze during live, naturalistic interactions, an approach that bridges lab-based and real-world contexts. Yan and colleagues22employed fast periodic visual stimulation EEG to uncover a robust neural marker of face identity familiarity, with potential applications in both cognitive neuroscience and clinical assessment. In sum, the abovementioned examples highlight the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, bringing together various perspectives to create a comprehensive understanding of face perception. By integrating developmental, cognitive, social, affective, and methodological contributions, this Collection underlines the primary role of facial stimuli, which can be considered essential ‘tools’ for interpreting and navigating the complexities of social life. Future research could explore how face perception works in environments that are increasingly present in modern societies, such as virtual settings shaped by artificial intelligence technologies and cross-cultural contexts. To conclude, as editors, we are optimistic that this Collection will foster fruitful dialogue within and across disciplines by informing both pure and applied research, contributing to developing novel theoretical frameworks, methodological tools, and practical interventions, and more broadly, expanding our understanding of human social cognition through the lens of face perception.

    "abstract": "The development of decellularized vascular tissues for tissue engineering and vascular implants presents a promising approach to creating functional blood vessels. However, effective endothelialization with human endothelial cells remains challenging. This study examined the endothelialization of decellularized porcine aortas using human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cell-derived endothelial cells. Various decellularization methods were used to create vessels with different luminal surface properties. hiPS-derived endothelial cells seeded on these vessels showed adhesion and alignment, particularly on those decellularized with the high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) method. These cells expressed higher levels of EphrinB2 compared to those cultured on flat surfaces, suggesting they respond to the vessel’s topographical features. The results indicate that hiPS-derived endothelial cells can adhere to and orient on decellularized porcine aortas, mimicking arterial endothelial behavior. For translational applications, achieving complete endothelial coverage by hiPSC-derived endothelial cells requires the establishment of optimal culture and seeding conditions. Nevertheless, these results highlight the importance of luminal surface topography and suggest that decellularized vascular tissues and implants can be designed with patterned surfaces to support endothelial behavior.",

    "title": "Mendelian randomization analysis of the association between vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia and the risk of developing lung disease",
    "abstract": "The causal relationship between vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia and the risk of developing lung diseases remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify that relationship using Mendelian randomization (MR) with Bayesian weighting, focusing on pulmonary fibrosis (PF), idiopathic PF (IPF), eosinophilic asthma (EA), squamous cell lung cancer (LUSC), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pulmonary embolism (PE). We analysed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, applied five MR models with Bayesian methods to assess causality, and validated the results via sensitivity analysis. The MVMR method explores whether vitamin B12-deficient anaemia affects the pathogenesis of IPF independently of BMI. SMR was used to explore IPF-related pathogenesis, whereas a meta-analysis was used to consolidate LUSC MR findings across ethnicities. IVW analysis revealed a positive causal link between vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia status and the risk of developing PF [OR (95% CI) = 1.161 (1.021, 1.319),P= 0.023], IPF [OR (95% CI) = 1.176 (1.002, 1.380),P= 0.047 (Bayesian MR)] and EA [OR (95% CI) = 1.394 (1.084, 1.793),P= 0.010]. The results of the study demonstrate that the development of IPF is influenced by vitamin B12 deficiency independently of BMI. Conversely, vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia status was negatively associated with the development of LUSC [OR (95% CI) = 0.879 (0.760, 0.995),P= 0.001], and no causal association was detected between vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia status and the development of COPD or PE. The reverse MR analysis yielded nonsignificant results. The SMR analysis revealed a significant association between IPF onset and CUBN, a vitamin B12 target. Post-MR meta-analysis confirmed the credibility and homogeneity of these findings. Vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia is causally associated with the development of PF, IPF, and EA but is negatively associated with the development of LUSC. No causality was observed for COPD or PE. Notably, CUBN emerged as a key IPF-related gene, highlighting the intricate relationship between vitamin B12 status and pulmonary health.",

    "title": "UGCG and the glycosphingolipid rheostat: a metabolic checkpoint governing immune activation and tumor immune evasion",
    "abstract": "In a recent study inCell, Morrison et al.1identified Ugcg and B4galt5 as super-enhancer–driven genes essential for glycosphingolipid synthesis in natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cells. Genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of UGCG disrupted cytotoxic granules, induced apoptosis, and blocked NK and CD8⁺ T cell expansion during viral infection, underscoring the critical role of glycosphingolipid metabolism in lymphocyte identity and effector function. The human genome contains over one million enhancers, but only a select few function as super-enhancers (SEs) that are large genomic regions densely occupied by transcription factors, chromatin remodelers, and coactivators such as Mediator driving high-level expression of genes critical for cell identity and function. Morrison et al.1identified several key NK cell identity genes residing in SE loci, includingCcl3,Ifnγ,Ifngr1,Runx1, andPrf1. Unexpectedly, the top-ranked SE was found not in a canonical effector gene, but inUgcg, the gene encoding UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG), an enzyme catalyzing the first committed step in glycosphingolipid (GSL) synthesis by converting ceramide to glucosylceramide (GlcCer), which is then converted to lactosylceramide (LacCer) by B4GALT5, with B4GALT6 acting redundantly. The authors demonstrated that GSL metabolism, specifically the simple GSL branch, is selectively essential for NK cell development and CD8⁺ T-cell cytotoxic function. Deletion ofUgcgearly in hematopoiesis abolished NK cell generation without affecting other immune lineages. Pharmacologic inhibition of UGCG using ibiglustat resulted in NK cell apoptosis, loss of cytotoxic granules, impaired expansion during viral infection, and disrupted granule integrity. Notably, B4galt5, also residing in an NK-specific SE locus, was equally essential; its product, LacCer, rescued NK cell viability in the face of UGCG inhibition. In contrast, complex GSLs such as asialo-GM1 were dispensable for NK survival and function. In CD8⁺ T cells responding to viral infection, bothUgcgandB4galt5were upregulated in parallel with cytotoxic genes, and their loss prevented the expansion of antigen-specific T cells. Thus, this study highlights LacCer as the central, indispensable metabolite in the GSL pathway for cytotoxic lymphocyte viability and function. LacCer can be further converted into gangliosides like GM3 (via ST3GAL5) and onward to GD3 and GT3 (via sialyltransferases such as ST8SIA1 and ST8SIA3). Morrison et al.1found LacCer to localize to cytolytic granules and the plasma membrane, where it functions beyond structural support to enable immune execution. As a critical component of lipid rafts, it facilitates recruitment of scaffolding proteins, Src-family kinases, and actin regulators to the immunological synapse. It supports receptor clustering and cytoskeletal alignment essential for granule convergence, maturation, and polarized release. Morrison et al. showed that under UGCG inhibition, NK cells exhibited fewer and morphologically aberrant cytotoxic granules, impaired calcium flux, and failed to form stable synapses with target cells. Although surface expression of adhesion molecules like CD2 remained intact, their recruitment to the synapse was defective, halting both activating and inhibitory signaling. These findings emphasize that UGCG-driven LacCer production is necessary for immune synapse formation and granule release, positioning LacCer as a metabolic linchpin for NK cell cytotoxicity. Genetic dissection of the GSL pathway confirmed LacCer’s unique role: while NK cells persisted in mice lacking complex gangliosides (B4galnt1−/−), deletion ofB4galt5andB4galt6mirrored the NK cell loss observed inUgcgknockouts. Intriguingly, deletion ofSt3gal5, the enzyme converting LacCer to GM3, did not impair NK cells but instead increased their frequency. Here, we hypothesize that deletion ofSt3gal5may offer a relief from downstream ganglioside-mediated immunosuppression, since tumor-associated gangliosides such as GM3, and GD3, are known to mask antigens,2control the TCR repertoire,3inhibit Fc receptor expression on monocytes and macrophages, leading to suppressed cytotoxicity, by promoting Treg development, and dampening dendritic cell activity. Thus, the loss or inhibition ofSt3gal5could preserve LacCer and enhance immune activation. Furthermore, we believe it is possible that the loss of ST8SIA1/3 may further block the generation of immunosuppressive gangliosides further enhancing NK cells. Thus, this study reveals a lipid rheostat governed by UGCG, where the balance between LacCer and its complex immunosuppressive derivatives modulates immune cell survival, homeostasis, and effector potential. Tumor cells exploit UGCG and downstream GSL enzymes to produce immunosuppressive gangliosides like GM3 and GD3. This pathway supports tumor immune evasion by masking and blocking the interactions of membrane proteins.2The therapeutic vulnerability of this axis was highlighted in another recent study3where UGCG inhibition (via eliglustat) synergized with anti–PD-1 therapy in tumor-bearing mice. Consistent with this duality, eliglustat treatment in tumor-bearing mice led to (1) Reduced tumor ganglioside levels and increased exposure of the major histocompatibility complex and tumor antigen peptides (2) Enhanced CD8⁺ T cell infiltration and (3) Synergistic tumor control when combined with anti–PD-1. However, at higher doses, eliglustat impaired T cell function,3mirroring the deleterious effects of UGCG knockout or high-dose ibiglustat as observed in Morrison’s study. These contrasting outcomes underscore a central principle: UGCG is a double-edged sword, required in immune cells function, yet hijacked by tumors for immune escape. UGCG supports tumor survival through two distinct mechanisms. First, apoptosis regulation: by converting ceramide to GlcCer, UGCG prevents ceramide-induced ER stress and apoptosis.4Second, multidrug resistance (MDR): GlcCer and downstream gangliosides modulate membrane fluidity and facilitate the localization of efflux transporters such as MDR1 in lipid rafts, thereby reducing chemotherapy efficacy. Across cancer models, UGCG overexpression correlates with poor chemotherapy response, and its inhibition can restore drug sensitivity.5Thus, UGCG acts as both an immune checkpoint and a chemoresistance engine, making it a uniquely strategic metabolic target. These findings suggest a new therapeutic opportunity: rather than globally suppressing UGCG, it may be more effective to strategically reprogram or selectively inhibit the glycosphingolipid pathway (Fig.1), depending on cell context. Indeed, in addition to NK and CD8 T-cells, ILC1s also have high expression ofUgcgandB4galt5. Therefore, it is important to understand UGCG impact on ILC1 cytolytic activity. In tumors, intermediate-dose eliglustat or next-generation UGCG inhibitors could reduce immunosuppressive gangliosides (e.g., GM3, GD3) while preserving LacCer in immune cells. Blocking ST3GAL5 and probably ST8SIA1/3 could allow LacCer accumulation while preventing the formation of GM3 and GD3, thereby disarming tumor-driven immunosuppression without depriving immune cells of essential lipids. This requires precise dose titration and could be guided by metabolic biomarkers such as the LacCer:GM3/GD3 ratio or enhancer accessibility at the UGCG locus in different cell types. Meanwhile, in effector immune cells like NK and CD8⁺ T cells, enforced UGCG expression, via ex vivo engineering, CRISPRa activation, or targeted delivery of LacCer analogs, may help restore synapse integrity and cytotoxicity in immunosuppressive environments. Therefore, UGCG and its branches emerges as a tunable metabolic checkpoint governing immune activation and tumor immune evasion.Fig. 1Divergent glycosphingolipid (GSL) metabolic profiles in immune and cancer cells highlight therapeutic targets. Cancer cells upregulate complex gangliosides (GM3, GD3, GD2, GT3) via ST3GAL5 and ST8SIA1/3, promoting immune evasion, drug resistance, and suppression of ceramide-induced apoptosis. In contrast, NK and CD8⁺ T cells depend on early GSLs like GlcCer and LacCer for granule integrity, lysosomal stability, and cytotoxic function. While NK cells naturally lack terminal gangliosides, making ganglioside inhibition (e.g., ST3GAL5/ST8SIA1/3 deletion) potentially enhancing to their function, CD8⁺ T cells may be enhanced by moderate GSL inhibition affecting mostly cancer cells or protected by UGCG overexpression. These differences suggest tailored approaches: targeting ganglioside synthesis to boost NK function and inhibit tumors, while protecting or engineering NK and CD8⁺ T-cells to resist GSL-targeting therapies. Therapeutic strategies include glycosyltransferase inhibition (eliglustat, ibiglustat), CAR-T cells against GD2/GD3, and genetic manipulation of UGCG or sialyltransferases.

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence and associated endothelial permeability are crucial factors in the dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Nesfatin-1 (NF-1), a neuropeptide involved in regulating appetite and energy homeostasis, has not been extensively studied for its pathophysiological role in AD. In this study, we found that NF-1 treatment improved cellular senescence in brain vascular endothelial bEnd.3 cells by restoring the expression of hTERT and TERF2 against oligomerized Aβ1-42. Additionally, NF-1 reduced p53 and p21 protein levels in bEnd.3 cells exposed to oligomerized Aβ1-42. Notably, NF-1 reduced oligomerized Aβ1-42-induced endothelial monolayer permeability by maintaining transendothelial electric resistance (TEER) and the levels of tight junction proteins claudin 5 and ZO-1. Furthermore, NF-1 suppressed the expression of VEGF-R1 but not VEGF-R2 in bEnd.3 cells exposed to oligomerized Aβ1-42. Overexpression of VEGF-R1 negated the protective effects of NF-1 against oligomerized Aβ1-42-induced cellular senescence and increased endothelial monolayer permeability, indicating the involvement of VEGF-R1 in this process. Using a transgenic (Tg APPswe/PSEN1dE9) AD mouse model, we demonstrated that NF-1 administration lowered VEGF-R1 expression in the brain cortex of AD mice. Moreover, NF-1 mitigated BBB dysfunction and enhanced the expression of claudin 5 and ZO-1 in the brains of AD mice. Our results suggest that NF-1 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating AD.",

    "abstract": "Abnormalities in goal-directed behavior, mediated by mesocorticolimbic reward system, contribute to worse clinical outcomes including higher risk of treatment dropout and drug relapse in opioid users (OU). Despite efforts to counteract such neural alterations, brain-based interventions for this disorder remain ineffective. In this sham-controlled randomized study, we report the initial results on the efficacy of transcranial magnetic stimulus (TMS) in normalizing reward functioning in this population. During a reward-based choice task, we applied robot-assisted 10-Hz TMS to the prefrontal cortex in OU (Active = 16, Sham = 18) and matched healthy controls (HC, Active = 22, Sham = 24) while we recorded the reward positivity — an electrophysiological signal believed to index sensitivity of the anterior midcingulate cortex (MCC) to rewards. A robotic arm positioned a TMS coil over a prefrontal cortex target, and 50 pulses were delivered at 10-Hz before every 10 trials (2000 pulses, 400 trials). Our results revealed an interaction between TMS (Active vs Sham) and Group (OU vs HC) (F1,72= 6.9, p = 0.01, η2= 0.09). First, in the Sham TMS condition, OU exhibited a blunted reward positivity compared to HC (p = 0.01, d = 0.84). Second, OU receiving active TMS displayed a larger reward positivity compared to OU receiving sham (p = 0. 003, d = 0.98), and no differences were observed between OU and HC (p = 0.42, d = 0.17) or HC receiving sham (p = 0.48, d = 0.11). We envision that targeting a specific frontal-cingulate reward pathway is an important first step to maintain long-terms effect of TMS on MCC reward function, which may enhance treatment success through the maintenance of treatment goals.",

Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), a class III histone deacetylase, is critical for maintenance of VSMC homeostasis and prevention of vascular remodeling-related diseases. In this study, we investigated the role of VSMC SIRT6 in AAD and the molecular mechanism. We showed that the expression levels of SIRT6 were significantly reduced in VSMCs of the thoracic aorta in AAD patients. We constructed a VSMC-specificSirt6deficient mouse line and found that loss ofSirt6in VSMCs dramatically accelerated angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced AAD formation and rupture, even without anApoe-deficient background. In human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs), knockdown ofSIRT6led to mitochondrial dysfunction and accelerated VSMC senescence. We revealed that SIRT6 bound to and deacetylated NRF2, a key transcription factor for mitochondrial biogenesis. However,Sirt6deficiency inhibited NRF2 and reduced mRNAs encoding mitochondrial complex proteins. Notably, MDL-811, a newly developed small-molecule SIRT6 agonist, effectively reversed Ang II-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in HASMCs. In a BAPN-induced TAAD mouse model, administration of MDL-811 (20 mg/kg, i.p., every other day for 28 d) effectively mitigated AAD progression and reduced mortality. These results suggest that SIRT6 plays a protective role against AAD development, and targeting SIRT6 with small-molecule activators such as MDL-811 could represent a promising therapeutic strategy for AAD.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVirtual reality (VR) technologies are increasingly being adopted in dental education, particularly in restorative dentistry, due to their capacity to simulate realistic clinical scenarios and enhance student learning. However, despite the growing interest, the overall research landscape in this field remains unclear. This study aimed to conduct a bibliometric analysis to evaluate the most influential research contributions, publication trends, and collaborative patterns related to VR in restorative dentistry.MethodsAn advanced search of the Web of Science Core Collection (WoS-CC) database was performed on 29th October 2024 using a combination of keywords and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms relevant to VR and restorative dentistry. Only original research and review articles in English were included. Bibliometric parameters such as citation metrics, authorship, institutional affiliations, countries of origin, and keywords were extracted and analyzed using Bibliometrix (R) and VOSviewer software.ResultsOut of 434 retrieved records, 62 articles met the inclusion criteria. A marked increase in publications was observed after 2019, with the USA, UK, and Netherlands emerging as the leading contributors. The most cited article received 73 citations, focusing on haptic simulators for motor skill acquisition. TheJournal of Dental Education, theEuropean Journal of Dental Education, andBMC Medical Educationwere among the most prolific journals. Despite global contributions, the analysis revealed limited interdisciplinary and international collaboration.ConclusionThis bibliometric study highlights the increasing research activity surrounding VR in restorative dentistry and its potential to transform dental education. While considerable progress has been made, further high-quality research and broader collaborative efforts are necessary to address existing gaps and fully harness the capabilities of VR and related immersive technologies in dental education.",

    "abstract": "Backgroundm1A, a prevalent RNA modification found in various RNA species, has recently been reported to modulate cancer progression. However, its effects on neuroblastoma remain uninvestigated.MethodsThe PCAT database was utilized to analyze the mRNA levels and survival probabilities of m1A regulator genes (TRMT6, TRMT61A, ALKBH1, and ALKBH3) in neuroblastoma patients. Silencing and recovery of TRMT6 were employed to investigate its role in neuroblastoma in vitro and in vivo. m1A-seq and RIP-qPCR were performed to identify and confirm the downstream targets of TRMT6. Additionally, Actinomycin D treatment was administered to assess mRNA stability.Resultsm1A transmethylase TRMT6 expression was significantly elevated in high-risk and late-stage neuroblastoma patients. Functionally, TRMT6 promotes the malignancy of neuroblastoma cells in vitro and promotes tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, TRMT6 reduces SST mRNA levels by inhibiting its stability in an m1A-YTHDF2-dependent manner, thereby promoting the development of neuroblastoma. Furthermore, SST analog octreotide suppresses neuroblastoma cell malignancy, tumor growth, and metastasis.ConclusionsTRMT6 mediates m1A modification of SST to promote neuroblastoma progression, suggesting that targeting TRMT6 may be a novel potential therapeutic approach for treating neuroblastoma.",

We sought to identify circulating metabolites mediating the effect of obesity on the risk of eight common cancers.MethodsUsing European ancestry data, we applied two-sample Mendelian randomisation (2S-MR) to screen 856 plasma metabolites for associations with body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR). Metabolite GWAS data were sourced from INTERVAL, and obesity traits from the GIANT consortium and UK Biobank. We assessed the impact of obesity-associated metabolites on cancer risk (384,738 cases across eight cancer types and 799,908 controls) and conducted mediation analyses to identify potential mediators of obesity-driven cancer risk.ResultsMR analysis yielded 107 BMI-driven metabolites and 126 WHR-driven metabolites. The strongest relationships with cancer risk were between levels of obesity-driven 1-linoleoyl-GPC, 2-linoleoyl-GPC, 1,2-dilinoleoyl-GPC, 1-arachidonoyl-GPA, and 1-pentadecanoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPC and colorectal cancer (CRC).

    "title": "Tissue-specific iron levels modulate lipid peroxidation and the FLASH radiotherapy effect",
    "abstract": "Iron is vital to living cells, playing a key role in cellular respiration, DNA synthesis, and various metabolic functions. Importantly, cancer cells have a higher dependency on iron compared to normal cells to support their rapid growth and survival. Due to this fact, tumors are more vulnerable to ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death. Radiation therapy (RT), a standard treatment for many cancer patients, is known to induce ferroptosis. Ultra-high dose rate FLASH RT offers an improved therapeutic window by minimizing damage to normal tissues while preserving tumor control. However, the precise biological mechanisms behind the protective effects of FLASH RT on normal tissues remain unclear. In this study, we propose that variations in lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis, driven by intrinsic differences in iron levels between normal and cancerous tissues, contribute to this effect. Our findings show that FLASH RT increases lipid peroxidation and induces ferroptosis in tumor cells but does not significantly elevate lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in normal tissues compared to conventional RT. To determine whether raising iron levels in normal tissues could abrogate the protective effects of FLASH, mice were fed a high-iron diet before RT. A high-iron diet before and after RT reversed the protective effect of FLASH, resulting in increased intestinal damage and lipid peroxidation. This suggests that baseline iron levels and iron-driven lipid peroxidation are critical factors in mediating the protective outcomes of FLASH RT. Overall, our study sheds light on the role of iron in modulating RT responses and provides new mechanistic insights into how FLASH RT influences normal and cancerous tissues.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy is the leading treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, many ALL patients eventually develop relapses, the treatment of which remains a major challenge due to their chemoresistance phenotype. As a step towards this end, we here uncovered that relapsed ALL specimens exhibit a significantly lower expression ofSTAT6but not of otherSTATs, when compared with their paired diagnosis specimens. Furthermore, STAT6 plays a distinctive role in chemosensitization of ALL cells to cytarabine (Ara-C), and T-box transcription factor 21(TBX21)emerged as a plausible intrinsic biomarker of this Ara-C chemosensitization. We demonstrate that STAT6 undergoes SUMOylation on Lys-307 and sentrin/SUMO-specific protease 3 (SENP3)-mediated deSUMOylation in ALL cells. Most importantly, Ara-C specifically induced SENP3 expression and SENP3 knockdown sensitized ALL cells to Ara-C, with an impact equivalent to STAT6 knockout. These findings support the feedback resistance conferred upon ALL cells by Ara-C-induced SENP3 expression. Our findings uncover a novel role for STAT6 in ALL resistance to Ara-C and suggest that its targeted deprivation or pharmacological inhibition specifically sensitizes ALL cells to Ara-C, offering a plausible modality to surmount Ara-C resistance in future ALL treatment.",

    "abstract": "In the evolutionary arms race between bacteria and viruses, retrons have emerged as distinctive antiphage defense systems. Here, we elucidate the structure and function of Retron-Eco2, which comprises a non-coding RNA (ncRNA) that encodes multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA, a DNA‒RNA hybrid) and a fusion protein containing a reverse transcriptase (RT) domain and a topoisomerase-primase-like (Toprim) effector domain. The Eco2 msDNA and RT-Toprim fusion protein form a 1:1 stoichiometric nucleoprotein complex that further assembles into a trimer (msDNA:RT-Toprim ratio of 3:3) with a distinctive triangular configuration. The RNA portion of the msDNA in one protomer closely intertwines around the RT domain of an adjacent protomer, mediating the formation of this self-inhibitory assembly. Upon activation, the Toprim effector domain exhibits RNase activity, degrading RNA to arrest phage replication. We further reveal that phage mutants evading Eco2-mediated defense harbor mutations in the endonuclease IV-like protein DenB, underscoring DenB’s critical role in triggering the activation of this system. Together, these findings provide key structural and functional insights into Retron-Eco2, laying the groundwork for harnessing its potential in biotechnology and synthetic biology applications.",

    "abstract": "The brain’s hemispheres exhibit profound lateralization, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Using proteomic and phosphoproteomic analyses of the bilateral striatum — a hub for important brain functions and a common node of autism pathophysiology — we identified significant phosphorylation asymmetries. Particularly, the phosphorylation processes in the left striatum appear more prone to disturbance. Notably, SH3RF2, whose single-copy knockout leads to autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-like behaviors in mice, is uniquely expressed in the striatum, forming a complex with CaMKII (an ASD-associated protein) and PPP1CC. Loss of SH3RF2 disturbs the CaMKII/PP1 “switch”, resulting in hyperactivity of CaMKII and increased phosphorylation of its substrate GluR1. InSh3rf2-deficient mice, heightened GluR1-Ser831 phosphorylation and its aberrant postsynaptic membrane localization in the left striatum may impair the functional lateralization of striatal neurons and contribute to autism-like behaviors. This study unveils the first molecular mechanism governing brain lateralization in mammals, linking its impairment to autism development and treatment strategies.",

Moreover, Ds were found to accumulate in the kidneys of these model rats, effectively reducing crystalline deposits, mitigating renal injury, and alleviating renal fibrosis.

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), while specific A-to-I editing events have been identified, their functional mechanisms and clinical relevance remain poorly understood. Here, through whole-transcriptome analysis of NSCLC specimens, we discovered a hyper-editing event at position c.1746 in the long non-coding RNA SNHG3 (c.1746 A > I), which correlates with advanced metastatic stages and reduced patient survival. Functional studies demonstrated that edited SNHG3 (SNHG3ED) exhibits significantly greater pro-metastatic activity compared to its wild-type counterpart (SNHG3WT). Mechanistically, SNHG3EDshows enhanced binding affinity for the chromatin remodeler SSRP1, triggering SSRP1-mediated replication origin assembly and subsequent upregulation of fatty acid metabolism and ferroptosis-related genes. This molecular rewiring promotes fatty acid oxidation, confers resistance to ferroptosis, and importantly, drives docetaxel (DTX) chemoresistance. In DTX-resistant NSCLC cell lines, patient-derived organoids, and Nude mouse xenograft tumor model, antisense oligonucleotide-based targeting of SNHG3EDeffectively restored DTX sensitivity and suppressed tumor growth. Our findings demonstrate that SNHG3 c.1746 A > I editing serves both as a novel prognostic biomarker for NSCLC and as a mechanistically defined therapeutic target to overcome DTX resistance, which offers a potential therapeutic target to improve DTX efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescent molecules are essential for bioimaging and visualizing cellular localization, functionalities, including biosensing, ion sensing, and photochromism. The photocleavable fluorescent protein PhoCl1 belongs to a sub-class of green-to-red photoconvertible β-barrel fluorescent protein and has a characteristic green fluorescence conferred by the chromophorep-HBI. In contrast to other photoconvertible proteins, that shift their fluorescence from green-to-red upon photoexposure, PhoCl1 has been reported to render itself non-fluorescent by releasing the 9 amino-acid C-terminal peptide fragment (CTPF) bearing the photo-transformed red chromophore from the β-barrel. Here we show the fate of photoreleased chromophore which shows an unexpected dim red fluorescence. We attribute this dim red fluorescence to the aggregation of CTPF molecules which is validated through dynamic light scattering measurements. We further characterize the aggregated CTPF through various optical techniques to determine the excitation/emission maxima, fluorescence lifetime, quantum yield and rotational correlation time through fluorescence anisotropy. We assessed the red fluorescence behavior under diverse environmental conditions including variations in pH, NaCl, and temperature. Molecular dynamics simulations support our experimentally observed aggregation of CTPF molecules. We supplemented these studies with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics study which indicated the role of the chromophore in the photodissociated peptide fragment in the generation of dim red fluorescence. These findings not only provide insight into the behavior of fluorescent chromophore-peptide conjugate but also potentially lay the groundwork for developing light-activated fluorescence systems, AIE-based biosensors, and tunable biomaterials for protein tagging and responsive material design.",

We combine recent in-situ observations, climate reanalysis and remote sensing data to force a land-surface model to reconstruct glacier changes over the last two decades (1999–2023) and disentangle their causes over a benchmark glacierized catchment in Tajikistan. We show that snowfall and snow depth have been substantially lower since 2018, leading to a decline in glacier health and reduced runoff generation. Remote-sensing observations confirm wider snow depletion across the Northwestern Pamirs, suggesting that a lack of snowfall might be a cause of mass losses regionally. Our results provide an explanation for the recent decline in glacier health in the region, and reinforce the need to better understand the variability of precipitation.",

Reconstructing the initialfO2records in the mantle right after core formation for terrestrial planets remain challenging due to frequent secondary modifications. Here, we show based on studies of ureilites and diogenites that measurable Ti isotope fractionation occurred during melt extraction from planetary mantle in the presence of Ti3+, and demonstrate that Ti isotopes can serve as afO2tracer of planetary mantle reservoirs. We also show a positive correlation between the49Ti/47Ti and La/Yb ratios for shergottites, which, when integrated with chronological constraints, imply the occurrence of Ti isotope fractionations arising from the presence of Ti3+during early mantle differentiation of Mars. Further constraints define reducing conditions of ~ΔIW–0.8 to ~ΔIW–1.6 for early-formed martian mantle reservoirs at ~4.5 Ga. ThisfO2estimate coincides with the lowest recommended values from martian meteorites, that of core-mantle differentiation for Mars and of diogenites, but is more oxidizing than that of ureilites. Mantle outgassing under these conditions would result in a reducing primordial atmosphere that is in stark contrast with Mars’ current CO2-dominated atmosphere.",

Here we show that rising carbon dioxide intensifies aridity over vast regions, particularly in vulnerable and climate-sensitive drylands based on idealized emission-driven simulations from an Earth System Model. Notably, even as carbon dioxide concentrations decline, arid regions continue to expand and experience worsening conditions, exacerbating climate injustice and resource conflicts. This pronounced hysteresis is primarily driven by long-lasting precipitation reductions in the tropics, linked to hysteresis of the intertropical convergence zone. The asymmetric response of arid zones suggests that reversing aridity intensification under global warming is exceptionally difficult. Further analysis highlights that negative carbon dioxide emissions may be essential to mitigating these deteriorating conditions, yet full recovery requires extended timescales. Our findings underscore irreversible risks of delayed action and stress the urgent need for carbon neutrality strategies that go beyond net-zero targets.",

Solid-liquid interfacial reactions during rewetting drove iron and manganese redox cycling, generating reactive oxygen species that directly promoted carbon mineralization. These reactive oxygen species synergized with enzymes to degrade organic carbon, preferentially targeting dissolved organic matter with low hydrogen-to-carbon ratios and high double bond equivalents, which are typically resistant to microbial degradation. Our findings show that abiotic processes dominate short-term carbon dynamics during rewetting of arid sandy soils.",

    "title": "Towards inclusive risk-informed infrastructure development in expanding cities",
    "abstract": "Conventional natural-hazard risk-modeling approaches do not consider possible unintended negative socioeconomic consequences of designing infrastructure expansions in a risk-informed way. Here, we propose a people-centered decision-making framework for urban infrastructure development that addresses this issue. The framework integrates a bespoke agent-based model that accounts for implications of variations in infrastructure expansion on dynamic land values and related residential location decision making. This means that the model captures macro-scale socioeconomic effects resulting from infrastructure development that are not explicitly related to natural-hazard events. The underlying algorithm balances these considerations with the successful operation of the infrastructure itself and the potential infrastructure performance losses that accompany a natural-hazard event. We demonstrate the framework by optimizing the expansion of transportation in a virtual urban testbed that imitates a typical expanding urban context in the Global South. This work can be used to guide inclusive risk-sensitive infrastructure planning in hazardous, rapidly growing cities.",

    "title": "Gene augmentation therapy restores vision and preserves photoreceptors in a mouse model ofCNGA1-retinitis pigmentosa",
    "abstract": "BackgroundRetinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a leading cause of blindness affecting 2 million people worldwide. Mutations in cyclic nucleotide-gated channel alpha 1 (CNGA1) account for 2–8% of autosomal recessive RP with no available treatment. Here we further evaluate our previously developedCnga1-/-mouse model. We aim to present detailed phenotype data and assess the therapeutic efficacy of gene augmentation in this model.MethodsThe retinal function and structure ofCnga1-/-mice were accessed from postnatal month 1 to 6. AAV8-hRHO-mCnga1was constructed and delivered into the subretinal space of 2-week-oldCnga1-/-mice. Retinal function, photoreceptor survival, and vision-guided behavior were evaluated following treatment.ResultsHere we show thatCnga1-/-mice have a similar phenotype to human patients, characterized by an early loss of rod-mediated retinal function and progressive photoreceptor degeneration, which is nearly complete by 6 months of age. Gene augmentation therapy results in robust expression of correctly localized CNGA1 protein, sustained rescue of retinal function and long-term preservation of photoreceptors for at least 9 months. Treated mice also show improved performance in a vision-guided behavior test. RNA-seq reveals upregulation of genes associated with phototransduction.ConclusionsTo the best of our knowledge, this work demonstrates for the first time that a gene augmentation approach can restore vision and preserves photoreceptors in an animal model ofCNGA1-RP. These findings pave the way for future development of gene augmentation therapy for patients withCNGA1-RP.",

    "abstract": "We read with interest the systematic review and meta-analysis by Chen et al. [1] showing that similar outcomes were noted postoperatively no matter whether retinopexy was performed in combination with scleral buckling or not. The authors observed similar reattachment rate, final VA and complication rates between the two groups.The authors agree with the hypothesis that buckle placement is a permanent procedure and therefore its effect on retinal re-attachment is a permanent one. However, both clinical practice and literature have highlighted the fact that buckle removal may be required on several occasions for different indications [2,3,4]. Some common risk factors include exposed scleral buckle and infection, diplopia, patient discomfort or other ocular procedures [2,3,4]. While buckle removal may be a safe procedure if adequate retinopexy has been performed before, it is likely that buckle removal in non-retinopexy cases will result in retinal break re-opening and retinal re-detachment.",

    "title": "Financial technology and banking performance in developing countries: evidence from an advanced quantile regression approach",
    "abstract": "FinTech has emerged as a transformative force in the global banking industry, especially in developing economies where digital solutions are rapidly redefining financial access, efficiency, and competition. Despite its growing relevance, empirical research remains limited regarding the heterogeneous effects of FinTech on banking performance and the role of institutional quality in shaping these outcomes. This study investigates the impact of FinTech adoption on bank performance in 33 developing Asian countries from 2010 to 2022 while assessing the moderating effect of economic governance. Using the Method of Moments Quantile Regression and Bootstrapped Quantile Regression, the analysis captures distributional dynamics and robustly estimates relationships across different levels of bank performance. Findings reveal a consistently positive and statistically significant impact of FinTech on bank performance, particularly in lower-performing banks, suggesting that FinTech fosters financial inclusion and competitiveness. Economic governance is also shown to exert a direct and positive influence, especially in institutional environments where regulatory stability and accountability enhance operational outcomes. Furthermore, the interaction between FinTech and governance is significant, indicating that stronger institutional frameworks amplify the beneficial effects of FinTech. These results are stable across various quantiles and robust to alternative specifications. The study offers critical insights for policymakers and financial regulators, emphasizing the need for synchronized development of digital financial infrastructure and governance frameworks to maximize performance gains in the banking sector. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic’s role in accelerating digital adoption, the findings underscore the importance of institutional resilience in mitigating associated risks. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on digital finance and economic development by integrating technological innovation and institutional quality into a unified empirical framework, offering actionable recommendations for sustainable banking reforms in developing regions.",

    "abstract": "The integration of positive psychology into second language (L2) education has generated increasing interest in L2 teachers’ perceptions of a supportive work environment (SWE), given its close relationship with their mental health. However, a reliable and concise scale to measure this perception, with strong psychometric properties, has yet to be developed. This study aims to address this gap by developing a streamlined version of the Supportive Work Environment Scale (SWES) and specifying its contributions to emotional experiences, a crucial component of mental health. The study involved two samples, totaling 753 Chinese L2 teachers. In Sample 1 (n= 351), exploratory factor analysis identified a three-factor structure for the SWES, consisting of 20 items across three factors: school support, supervisor support, and colleague support. Confirmatory factor analysis conducted on Sample 2 (n= 402) supported the model’s fit. The SWES also demonstrated good convergent validity, discriminant validity, and internal consistency. Additionally, it showed that enjoyment was most strongly linked to school support, pride to supervisor support, anxiety to colleague support, and anger to school support. These findings suggest that the SWES is an effective tool for assessing L2 teachers’ perceptions of SWE and underscores its role in shaping their emotional experiences.",

    "title": "The manuring principles in ancient China from the perspective of theSan Caitheory",
    "abstract": "The application of fertilizer is an important means of farmland management in both the past and the modern society, which is of great significance to increase food yield and improve soil structure to achieve sustainable development. Even in modern agriculture, how to scientifically and effectively apply fertilizers while reducing environmental pollution is still a key problem to be solved. China has a long history of farmland management theory and practical experience, and offers valuable insights through historical literature. Although research has revealed manuring practices across regions like Europe, Asia, and Africa since the Neolithic periods, the guiding principles remain insufficiently understood. Here we examine Chinese fertilization-related texts, highlighting principles of past fertilization according to time, soil, crops, and human effort, anchored in theSan Caitheory (Heaven, Earth, and Humanity). Ancient farmers had already understood the importance of applying targeted fertilizers at different stages of crop cultivation and adjusting fertilizer application based on seasonal rhythms. They knew how to apply fertilizers according to the soil characteristics influenced by both zonal and non-zonal factors, and could adjust fertilizer types and application techniques to suit the specific needs of different crops. Over time, the role of humanity within the fertilization system became increasingly emphasized, encompassing both human labor and the harmonious unity between individuals and society. This reflects the deepening integration of theSan Caifertilization framework. By revisiting these practices, this study helps fill the gaps in our understanding of prehistoric land management and provides valuable insights for advancing sustainable agricultural development in diverse ecological and cultural contexts. The emphasis on organic fertilizers, nutrient cycling, and soil conservation in ancient China presents a sustainable model for contemporary agriculture, offering more eco-friendly and efficient solutions to issues such as soil degradation, nutrient imbalances, and the overuse of chemical fertilizers.",

    "title": "Echoes of home: Turkish Cypriot IDPs and home perception in the context of ruins",
    "abstract": "This paper examines the home perceptions of Turkish Cypriot internally displaced persons (IDPs), whose villages and homes have remained abandoned and uninhabited since 1975. While Cyprus has endured one of Europe’s longest internal displacement crises, the scholarly attention has predominantly focused on political-legal aspects of displacement or experiences of the Greek Cypriot IDPs. Based on three years of research, including photographing abandoned settlements and in-depth interviews with ten Turkish Cypriot IDPs from Zacharia and Melandra, this study explores how displaced individuals perceive the meanings of ‘home.’ Findings reveal a strong attachment to their pre-1975 homes, while viewing post-displacement homes as temporary shelters that were belonging to ‘someone else’. While their pre-1975 villages and homes were idealized, frozen in their memory, revisits after the checkpoint openings in 2003 revealed a difference between nostalgic memories and present realities. The moment of return triggered a shift from nostalgic longing toreflective nostalgia, as participants were confronted with the emotional weight of ruins and absence, experiencing a form of mourning related to both place and time. This encounter created a sense of frustration with nostalgia, not rooted in a desire to reconstruct the past, but in the painful awareness that the home preserved in memory no longer exists. Their visits, approximately twenty-eight years later, only confirmed that nostalgia is not aboutrestoringthe past but about feeling both the longing and the mourning of what is lost. These findings refine researchers understanding of how displacement and nostalgia shape conceptions of home and identity, extending insights into broader discussions in the humanities, cultural studies, and social sciences.",

    "title": "Fractal characteristics of coastal settlement land use patterns in Xiamen City",
    "abstract": "With the rapid development of the marine economy, land use in coastal urban areas has exhibited significant spatial complexity that increases with changes in population and economic‒industrial structures. To quantify urban complexity and its relationship with economic and demographic factors, this study analyses the fractal characteristics of coastal settlement patterns in Xiamen, China, and their correlations with GDP and population. The results show that the fractal dimension of settlement land-use patterns follows a nonlinear trend over time. Projections indicate that outside Xiamen Island, the fractal dimension will decline to a critical threshold of 1 by 2028, emphasizing the urgency of land-use conservation. Additionally, a negative correlation is observed between the fractal dimension and both the regional GDP and the resident population on and off Xiamen Island. Correlation analysis suggests that areas outside the island with higher fractal dimensions may have greater potential for GDP growth and population expansion compared to the island itself. This study provides insights into the fractal mechanisms of coastal settlements and supports the optimization of land-use control strategies. By quantifying small-scale and dynamic characteristics of fractal landscapes, this study provides decision-making support for spatial planning and resource allocation in coastal regions and represents a valuable contribution to urban geography.",

    "title": "Evolutionary game analysis of quality regulation in live streaming e-commerce: insights from China",
    "abstract": "Despite repeated regulatory interventions, product quality scandals persist in China’s live streaming e-commerce market, severely eroding consumer trust and hindering industry sustainability. To investigate the systemic roots of these challenges, this study develops a four-party game model involving streamers, manufacturers, platforms, and consumers to explore their strategic choices. Unlike prior tripartite models, this study offers two novel insights: (1) explicitly modeling manufacturers’ production decisions, revealing key incentives for non-self-disciplined practices; (2) integrating empirical observations with game-theoretic simulation, bridging the theory-practice gap in extant studies. Numerical simulations coupled with empirical observations of representative quality incidents reveal a previously underexplored phenomenon: the interdependent relationships between platforms and top-tier streamers may induce platforms’ negative supervision behaviors when streamers practice loose product selection. Such a permissive environment can encourage manufacturers’ non-self-disciplined production practices, enabling substandard products to enter the market through streamers’ amplified influence, constituting a critical determinant of recurrent quality crises. Key findings demonstrate: (1) Platforms’ regulatory intensity should be optimally maintained at a moderate level; (2) Reducing platform dependence on top-tier streamers can enhance their regulatory autonomy; (3) Consumers’ active defense generates reputation pressure that may incentive platforms and streamers to alter loose practices, partially mitigating quality risks, when sustained public engagement occurs.",

    "abstract": "Burnout significantly impacts employee well-being and organisational efficiency, particularly in high-intensity and rigid environments such as Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs). This study examined a novel intervention that combined cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and doodle theory to mitigate burnout among grassroots employees in Chinese SOEs. Over two years, the Happy Doodle Toolkit (HDT) was developed through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and co-design methods. A four-week field experiment involving 38 participants measured outcomes using the Maslach Burnout Inventory–General Survey and collected 152 doodle diaries. Mean scores demonstrated significant improvements in burnout inventory measures, including emotional exhaustion (ΔM= −0.38), cynicism (ΔM= −0.25), and professional efficacy (ΔM= +0.27), allp< 0.001. Notably, younger employees (≤35 years) exhibited more substantial improvements, with cynicism declining more steeply than in older employees, as confirmed by a significant interaction between measurement time and age group (F= 5.759,p= 0.022). Qualitative data revealed enhanced emotional expression, cognitive reframing, and more positive work attitudes, aligning with the quantitative improvements. This study offers insights into the effectiveness of combining CBT and doodling as an intervention to reduce burnout. It provides new perspectives on enhancing mental health and job satisfaction among SOE employees and underscores the potential for personalised, cost-effective interventions in organisational settings.",

This service evaluation reports uptake, usage, linkage with wearable devices, and measures of effectiveness. Service users were adults living with severe obesity (body mass index ≥40 kg/m2or ≥35 kg/m2with a comorbidity) referred to a regional weight management service from November 2023 to August 2024. Those without physical activity contraindications were offered Steps4Health during their initial consultation. Steps4Health provides personalised goal-setting and feedback on stepping and other 24-hour behaviours alongside educational material and enables linkage to wearable activity devices incorporating baseline physical activity levels. Data extraction allowed for at least 6 weeks of follow-up, assessing uptake, demographic characteristics, usage patterns, and longitudinal stepping data. Of 559 service users, 307 (54.9%) were eligible for Steps4Health. 290 (51.9%) individuals completed registration and logged into Steps4Health an average of 28 times (8.3 minutes/ login) over a 6-week period. The most popular features of Steps4Health were educational resources providing information on physical activity and chronic conditions. At baseline users averaged 4079 (95% CI 2628, 4531) steps/day. 139 (24.9%) logged at least two days of stepping data. Over the first 6 weeks, an average clinically meaningful increase of 974 (581, 1366; p < 0.001) steps/day was observed. Steps4Health, a bespoke digital tool promoting increased physical activity in inactive clinical populations, was used by half of all individuals within a regional weight management service with half again regularly self-monitoring daily physical activity with a clinically meaningful increase observed over the first 6 weeks. Steps4Health shows promise as part of a broader strategy to enhance physical activity engagement within clinical weight management services.Disclosures:None Jo Howe1,*, Annabel Walsh2, Alex Kenny2, Justine Lovell2, Hafsah Habib1, Amy Ahern3, Maura MacPhee4, Geoff Wong5, Suzanne Higgs6, Katherine Allen7, Max Carlish6, Sheri Oduola8, Rachel Upthegrove5, Ian Maidment11Aston University, Birmingham, UK,2The McPin Foundation, London, United Kingdon,3University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK,4University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada,5University of Oxford, Oxford, UK,6University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK,7Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, United Kingdon,8University of East Anglia, Norwich, UKPeople with serious mental illness (SMI) face stark health inequalities, including reduced life expectancy. A major contributor is rapid weight gain from antipsychotic medications, which triggers metabolic changes—such as insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, and increased appetite—leading to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Despite the urgency, tailored interventions are lacking. Using realist approaches grounded in lived experience, the NIHR-funded RESOLVE study aimed to identify what non-pharmacological interventions work, for whom, and in what circumstances to prevent and manage antipsychotic-related weight gain. The study was delivered in three phases: a realist review synthesising existing evidence; a realist evaluation involving interviews with people with SMI, carers, and healthcare professionals to test (confirm, refute or refine) emerging theories; and the co-production of recommendations for healthcare professionals. Lived experience involvement was central, with a Lived Experience Group (LEG) managed by The McPin Foundation, lived experience co-applicants, and NHS-based collaborators contributing throughout. The LEG shaped programme theories, advised on interview schedules ensuring inclusive non-stigmatising language, and highlighted overlooked issues such as the profound impact on appetite/food drive and disordered eating behaviours among others. Their insights informed evidence searches, theory refinement, and practical recommendations. Lived experience input identified key contextual factors affecting intervention effectiveness, including dual stigma, service accessibility and responsibility, HCP knowledge and readiness for change. The study developed recommendations for clinical settings: initiating early conversations, integrating peer support, addressing disordered eating, and tailoring interventions to recovery stages. A key finding was that little is being done in practice—weight gain is often not discussed, dismissed or normalised, delaying intervention and reducing motivation. LEG members presented findings nationally and internationally, wrote blogs, engaged clinicians and co-authored academic papers. LEG contributions enhanced the relevance, reach, and uptake. Funding has been secured to develop preventative weight management pathways now being trialled and evaluated via NHS-led quality improvement projects, supported by a national community of practice. RESOLVE shows the power of meaningful co-production. By integrating realist approaches with lived experience, it offers a strong model for addressing antipsychotic weight gain and lays foundations for future research, guidance, and service transformation.Disclosures:The RESOLVE project was funded by the NIHR (HS&DR 131871).

Southwark Council’s Integrated Healthy Lifestyle Service (IHLS) offers a single point of access for residents to local and national health services (e.g., weight management, exercise referral). Referrals are managed by the Healthy Lifestyle Hub (HLH), a telephone-based triage service aiming to enhance referral efficiency and follow-up with service users to support behaviour change, in turn, improving health outcomes and narrowing health inequalities. One of the local services the HLH refers onto is Exercise on Referral (EoR). The aim of this evaluation was to understand how the HLH influences referral to and engagement in EoR. Public and stakeholder consultations informed evaluation priorities, logic models, and recruitment strategies. We conducted a mixed-methods evaluation, including both process and outcome components across three work packages (WPs). WP1 involved secondary analysis of referral, attendance, and health data (e.g., BMI) from HLH and EoR users; WP2 involved an online survey of HLH users, exploring reasons for non-initiation of referrals (descriptive and inferential statistics were performed as data allowed for WP1/WP2); WP3 involved semi-structured interviews and focus groups with service users, staff, and non-initiators to explore service experiences (codebook thematic analysis). The data shared from WP1 highlighted inconsistencies in data linkage and a high degree of missing follow-up data, making it challenging to determine any objective changes in behaviour or health. Survey data (WP2) was available for 163 people, with seven individuals providing information on why they were referred to EoR but did not intend on initiating the service (e.g., inappropriate day/time). WP3 findings found that service users reported weight loss and improved mental health. However, they felt a 12-week intervention was insufficient for sustaining behaviour change. Service users also stated a lack of low-cost post-programme support options and communication challenges with the HLH, EoR and leisure centre staff. Key service recommendations included improving data collection and linkage, extending post-programme support, improving communication with service users, and clarifying referral processes. Implementation of these recommendations will improve programme accessibility, programme engagement, behaviour change and health outcomes, and importantly the ability to accurately evidence such changes.Disclosures:This project is funded by the NIHR [Public Health Research programme (NIHR 166241)/PHIRST Elevate NIHR160288].

Cox regression estimated hazard ratios (HRs), adjusting for socio-demographics, family history, and lifestyle factors. Log-likelihood ratio tests were used to examine the interaction. The average total weight gain from age 25 to baseline was 4.4 kg (SD 8.8). Results showed that greater total and annual weight gain were associated with elevated risk for both cardiovascular diseases and T2D. Compared to individuals with stable lower BMI, those moving from lower to higher BMI had an HR for T2D of 3.05 (95% CI 2.99–3.11), which remained 1.31 (1.29–1.34) after adjusting for baseline BMI. A strong interaction between total weight change and baseline BMI was observed, with joint analyses showing additional risk among participants who gained weight. Compared to participants with normal baseline BMI (20.0–24.9) and minimal weight change (−2.5–5.0 kg), participants with BMI ≥ 25.0 who gained weight had a 1.5-fold higher T2D risk than their stable weight counterparts (HR 3.43 vs. 2.23); among those with normal baseline BMI, weight loss was associated with a 22% reduced risk (HR 0.78), whereas weight gain increased risk by 70% (HR 1.70). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. In sum, weight gain from early to middle adulthood was associated with an increased CMD risk, particularly T2D, including individuals within normal middle adulthood BMI. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining a healthy weight throughout adulthood and suggest that future risk assessment and clinical guidelines should incorporate weight history, rather than relying solely on static BMI thresholds.Disclosures:The CKB baseline survey and the first re-survey were supported by the Kadoorie Charitable Foundation in Hong Kong.

This study examined whether childhood UPF consumption was associated with obesity in early adulthood and whether the association was modified by genetic susceptibility to obesity. This prospective cohort study included data 3,061 participants of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) in England with follow-up from 7 to 24 years. UPF consumption was calculated from food diaries based on the NOVA classification. LDpred2 was used to construct polygenic score (PGS) for body mass index (BMI). Linear regression models were used to estimate the association between UPF intake at 7 years and BMI at 24 years. PGS-UPF interaction was examined. Each 10% increase in the proportion of total energy intake coming from UPF at 7 was associated with 0.21 (95% CI 0.05–0.37) kg/m2 increase in BMI at 24, after adjusting for BMI at 7, age, sex, ethnicity, physical activity, socioeconomic position, total energy intake and BMI-PGS. A significant interaction was found between baseline UPF consumption at 7 and BMI-PGS on adulthood BMI (0.19; 95% CI 0.02–0.36), whereby the UPF-BMI association was only significant in children with the highest genetic predisposition to obesity (0.74, 95% CI 0.07–1.42). UPF consumption in childhood is only associated with early adulthood obesity among children genetically predisposed to obesity.Disclosures:NS has received research grant from AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis and Roche Diagnostics; personal fees from Abbott Laboratories, Afimmune, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly, Hanmi Pharmaceuticals, Merck Sharp & Dohme, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, Roche Diagnostics, Janssen; consulting fees from Amgen and Sanofi.

Digital weight loss services (DWLSs) offer opportunities for supporting weight management with non-pharmacological adjuncts. We sought to characterise the efficacy, safety, and adherence of a national-coverage DWLS, and understand the effects of digital engagement thereon. We aimed to assess whether engagement with a national DWLS improves six-month weight loss, treatment persistence and safety in adults prescribed tirzepatide or semaglutide. We retrospectively analysed DWLS users prescribed either agent between August 2024 and May 2025. Engagement required at least one coaching session, weekly weight logging and an additional DWLS app interaction. Weight loss was modelled with mixed effects, safety expressed per 100 patient-months and adherence compared by Kaplan–Meier and Cox methods. 72,456 patients were included: mean age 42.0 ± 12.4 years; 76.6% female; baseline BMI 35.3 ± 6.2 kg/m2. Engaged tirzepatide users (n = 10,051) lost 17.7% (95% CI −18.0 to −17.4) versus 14.0% (−14.2 to −13.8) in non-engaged users (n = 59,932), an absolute difference of 3.7 percentage points (p < 0.0001, Cohen’s d ≈ 0.59) over six months. Engaged semaglutide users (n = 211) lost 13.8% (−16.0 to −12.0) versus 11.2% (−12.2 to −10.1) in non-engaged users (n = 2,238), a 2.6 percentage-point difference (p = 0.03, d ≈ 0.46) over six months. Across 233,197 patient-months just 414 safety events occurred (0.18/100 pm; cumulative incidence 0.43 %); 48.3% produced no harm, 35.0% were minor, and 68.6% were classed very low risk, with prescribing errors (47.6%) and side-effects (20.1 %) predominating. Engagement prolonged pharmacotherapy: hazard ratios (HR) for discontinuation were HR 0.67 (95% CI 0.56–0.80) for tirzepatide and HR 0.79 (0.71–0.87) for semaglutide (log-rank p < 0.0001 for both), i.e. a 33% and 21% lower risk of discontinuing pharmacotherapy over six months. Embedding structured digital support within pharmacological obesity management therapy markedly augments and accelerates weight reduction, improves persistence and retains a favourable safety profile, underscoring the value of integrated digital care for people with obesity.Disclosures:HJ, DH, TC and AKC are employees of Menwell Ltd, which provides digital weight management service (“Voy”).

The importance of including the consumer voice in policy, programme, and research activities to generate positive health improvements is well established. However, minimal research has been conducted in a co-designed manner where consumers voice their experiences regarding how best to improve obesity-related health outcomes. To explore the real-world daily experiences of living with obesity from consumer experts, in order to identify key areas for healthcare improvement. Twenty-four self-identified experts with lived experience of obesity participated in semi-structured interviews, guided by a self-taken photograph or hand-drawn picture that represented their experience. This photovoice qualitative study was co-designed with experts in lived experience of obesity and obesity consumer health researchers. Interviews were guided by photovoice methodology and analysed using Braun and Clarke’s thematic analysis. Three overarching themes were identified: (1) regular dehumanising experiences; (2) the need for holistic obesity healthcare; and (3) raising awareness of the complexities of living with obesity. Participants described significant exposure to obesity discrimination in all facets of daily life, which, over time, was reported to contribute to internalised obesity stigma and, in some severe cases, internalised dehumanisation. Obesity was described as interconnected and complex, requiring a holistic, person-centred healthcare approach for positive outcomes. Participants called for public, tertiary, and healthcare education to raise awareness about the challenges of living with obesity and the harm and unacceptability of obesity stigma. The harmful impacts of obesity stigma dominated much of the participants’ discourse, including how systemic, interpersonal, and internalised stigma perpetuate further obesity-related health issues. These findings support international literature, but also indicate that the severity of obesity stigma as a barrier to improved health outcomes is under-recognised and warrants significant attention. Future research should explore the development of obesity education for public, tertiary, and healthcare audiences, with the aim of raising awareness and reducing stigma for people living with obesity. This education should be co-designed with individuals who have lived experience of obesity.Disclosures:KN salary and participant gratuities were funded as part of regular employment as research fellow with Monash University.

Women, particularly from minoritised ethnic groups, are most affected, impacting their health and their children's wellbeing. The risk of gestational diabetes (GDM) among FI women is well documented in the USA, but UK data, especially for South Asian women, is lacking. This study explores the intersection of South Asian ethnicity, FI and GDM risk in the UK. Data from the Born in Bradford’s Better Start (BiBBS) cohort, involving families from diverse, economically deprived areas in Bradford (recruited between 2015 and 2024), was used. Pregnant women completed a baseline questionnaire consented to link their maternity records. FI was assessed using the first 4 items from the USDA Household Food Security Survey Module 6-item short form, any affirmative response indicates FI. GDM was diagnosed at 24–28 weeks based on NICE guidelines. Potential confounders were selected using directed acyclic graphs to guide the analysis. Descriptive statistics summarised prevalence of FI and GDM by ethnic group, and multivariable logistic regression models will assess the association between FI and GDM. Secondary analyses will examine if adverse pregnancy outcomes differ among women with GDM based on FI status. A total of 5,697 women were included in the analysis (mean age = 29 years, SD = 5), the majority of women were from South Asian ethnic backgrounds (71.6%). Preliminary findings indicate that 20.5% of women reported experiencing FI during pregnancy. Among those reporting FI, 58.1% were South Asian, 23.9% were white, and 18.0% were from other ethnic groups. Overall, 19.9% of women were diagnosed with GDM; of these, 82.9% were South Asian, 11.0% from other ethnic backgrounds, and 5.9% were white. Among those diagnosed with GDM, 20.9 % reported experiencing FI. Considerable ethnic variation exists in both FI and GDM prevalence within this deprived UK setting. Subsequent multivariable analyses will clarify the extent to which FI independently contributes to GDM risk and will examine differences in adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes among women with GDM by FI status. These insights will guide the development of integrated nutritional and social interventions to mitigate maternal health inequalities.Disclosures:This research project was funded by Newcastle University Research Excellence Development Awards.

Prevalence may be underestimated due to limited availability of genetic testing. We present genetic results from a large cohort of children and young people (CYP) living with severe obesity from a tertiary paediatric weight management clinic. Between March 2022 and November 2024, 130 CYP with severe obesity (body mass index (BMI) > 99.6th centile for age) had genetic testing performed using the Rare Obesity Advanced Diagnosis™ 79-gene targeted panel. Variants were classified as pathogenic or potentially relevant variants; further subdivided into suspected pathogenic, variants of unknown significance and suspected benign. 69/130 patients were female. Age ranged from 1.5–17.5 years with onset of obesity between 1–11 years of age. Mean BMI was 34.0 kg/m2(range 22.1–55.0) and mean BMI-SDS was +3.78 (range +2.10–6.46). 9.2% (12/130) had pathogenic variants and suspected pathogenic variants were found in 10.8% (14/130). 16.9% (22/130) had variants of unknown significance, 14.6% (19/130) had suspected benign variants (some had more than one variant) and one had a deletion in the 16p11.2 chromosomal region. MC4R heterozygous was the most frequent pathogenic variant (3.8%; 5/130). PCSK1 p.(Asn221Asp) heterozygosity, conferring increased polygenic risk for obesity, was found in 12.3% (16/130). Prevalence of autistic spectrum disorder (28.6% v 28.4%), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (20.4% v 23.5%) and learning disability (22.4% v 23.5%) was similar for CYP with detected variants (pathogenic or potentially relevant) and those without variants or with a PCSK1 polymorphism only. BMI-SDS was also similar for those with (+3.69) and without variants. Of those with detected variants, 36.7% had a maternal history of obesity (v 36.7% without) and 24.5% had a paternal history of obesity (vs 18.3% without). In this cohort, almost 1/10 patients had pathogenic variants associated with obesity and a further 1/10 had suspected pathogenic variants. Characteristics including BMI, neurodiversity, learning disability and family history of obesity were not predictive for variants being detected. Increased provision of genetic testing may enable both a deeper understanding of monogenic obesity and the development of further targeted therapies.Disclosures:None Floricia Crusset1,2,*, Enora Lecorgne1, Julien Fassy2, Antonio Iannelli3, Imed Ben Amor3, Bérengère Chignon-Sicard1,4, Luigi Formicola1, Alain Doglio1,5, Christian Dani1,6, Bernard Mari2, Georges Vassaux2, Vincent Dani11Exadex-innov, Nice,2Institut de Pharmacologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Université Côte d’Azur, Sophia Antipolis,3Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice, Nice,4Polyclinique Saint-George, Nice,5Faculté de Chirurgie Dentaire, Université Côte d’Azur, Nice,6Faculté de Médecine, Université Côte d’Azur, NiceDevelopment of obesity leads to the accumulation of visceral adipose tissue (VAT), which undergoes inflammation, fibrosis, and metabolic dysregulation. VAT is strongly associated with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, Metabolic Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH), and cardiovascular diseases. Current non-animal models such as 2D cultures, organoids, and microfluidic organ-on-chips have limited physiological relevance as they do not fully mimic the physiopathology of human obese VAT. Furthermore, sourcing human VAT for research purposes requires highly regulated clinical studies, making it difficult to obtain. The development of clinically relevant VAT models is therefore essential to identify novel treatments for obesity-related metabolic diseases. Expression levels of inflammatory, fibrotic and metabolic markers in VAT from patients with obesity are not well characterized in the literature. To overcome this limitation, we analysed visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) samples from 10 patients with obesity to establish a molecular, phenotypic, and functional profile of VAT in obesity. Using medium-throughput microfluidic qPCR and multiplex cytokine assays, we identified and quantified markers of inflammation, fibrosis, and metabolism. Our analysis revealed a distinct pathological signature of obese VAT compared to obese SAT, characterized by an increased inflammation, a potential impairment in ECM degradation leading to fibrosis, and metabolic dysregulation. In order to develop a model mimicking obese VAT, we cultured SAT from non-obese (lean) donors up to 2 weeks ex vivo according to the patented process named ExAdEx, which preserves the native tissue microenvironment, progenitor populations, vascular network and ECM. The generated lean donor tissue-derived ExAdEx models were exposed to various stimuli to reproduce the expression profiles of markers found in obese VAT. Preliminary results show that a specific TNFα stimulation kinetic can reproduce an inflammatory phenotype similar to that observed in obese VAT. Furthermore, gene expression profile linked to VAT pathology can be modulated using different stimuli such as pro-fibrotic TGF-β1. This approach enables the development and use of models that faithfully mimics the physio-pathological features of human VAT. These models represent a promising preclinical tool for the screening and development of novel therapies against obesity-related metabolic diseases.Disclosures:This work was funded by ExAdEx-Innov and supported by Bourse French Tech Emergence program from BpiFrance, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) de Nice (reference number 22-AOIP-04), the National Association for Research and Technology (ANRT) under CIFRE Thesis program reference number 2023/0469, the French government through the France 2030 investment plan managed by the National Research Agency (ANR), as part of the Initiative of Excellence Université Côte d’Azur under reference number ANR-15-IDEX-01.

Research demonstrates that applying the SOC model in weight management programmes can support behavioural changes. However, there is limited research on its use in digital interventions for patients prescribed anti-obesity medications (AOMs). Given their decision to start medication, it may be assumed that patients are in the preparation or action SOC. Yet, programmes designed solely around later stages would overlook opportunities to support those in earlier stages. This study explores the distribution of SOC among patients starting an AOM based digital weight management programme and assesses differences between those who engage in optional digital Health Coaching (HC) and those that do not (HNC). As part of a larger evaluation survey conducted among patients enrolled in the programme, a subsample of 288 participants who completed the SOC measure was analysed. Participants were adults (>18 years) with a BMI > 30 kg/m2enrolled in a UK-based digital weight management programme between March 2024-March 2025. All had downloaded the programme app, remained active (i.e., had not paused or cancelled), and were prescribed AOMs with access to HC. Participants were asked to reflect on their mindset at programme start and select a statement aligning with a SOC. Engagement with HC was tracked to examine differences in distribution between HC and NHC. Of the 288 participants, 27% had engaged in digital HC. Most reported being in the action and maintenance SOC. There were minor differences in the distribution of SOC between HC and NHC patients, however NHC patients tended to be in later SOC. HC/NHC; Pre-contemplation (5%/1%), Contemplation (6%/2%), Preparation (15%/14%), Action (39%/42%), Maintenance (34%/41%). This study demonstrates that patients’ SOC vary when joining a digital weight management programme, underlining the importance of personalised interventions and avoiding a ‘one size fits all’ approach to onboarding protocols. Limitations of this study include the retrospective completion of SOC measure. Future prospective studies should examine the impact of the use of the SOC in personalised interventions.Disclosures:All authors are employees or consultants at Vir Health Ltd (T/A Numan) Uzma Ashraf1, Sheela Sathyanarayan1, Tara Ocleirigh1, Clara Portwood1, Laurence J Dobbie2, Kathryn Waller1, Tamsin Hill1, Joanna Hollington1, Siobhan Ewing1, Abhiti Gulati1, Barbara McGowan1, Piya Sen Gupta1, Claudia Coelho1*, Daniela R Alves11Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK,2Kings College London, London, UKIndividuals living with obesity often face significant psychological stress, leading to higher rates of depressive symptoms and disordered eating. While glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RAs) like semaglutide effectively promote weight loss and reduce weight-related complications, evidence on their psychological effects is limited. This study aims to evaluate changes in depressive symptoms and binge eating behaviours among patients with obesity undergoing treatment with semaglutide within a Specialist Weight Management NHS obesity service. Patients completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Binge Eating Scale (BES) at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. Changes in psychological parameters were assessed over the treatment period. Preliminary data from 30 patients who had been taking semaglutide for 6–8 months were analysed. Participants had an average age of 49.1 years (SD ± 12.6), with 80% female and 44% white. The initial Body Mass Index (BMI) was 50.3 kg/m2(SD ± 11.4), and the mean glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was 42.3 mmol/mol (SD ± 7.1). There was a reduction in median PHQ-9 scores from 7 at baseline to 5 at 6 months; however, this change was not statistically significant (W = 162.5, p = 0.15). In contrast, BES scores showed a significant improvement, decreasing from a median of 15 to 11 (W = 70.0, p < 0.001, r = 0.61). Preliminary findings indicate a significant reduction in binge eating severity and a non-significant trend toward improved depressive symptoms among those treated with semaglutide over six months. These initial results stress the need for further studies to validate these findings and explore the psychological effects of semaglutide in obesity treatment.Disclosures:None Oluwaseun Anyiam1,2*, Arash Ardavani1,2, Rushdina Sofia Abdul Rashid3, Avinash Panesar4, Aniqah Bhatti5, Saif Khan-Madni1, Olakunmi Ogunyemi2, Iskandar Idris1,21University of Nottingham, Derby, UK,2University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust, Derby, UK,3United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, Lincoln, UK,4Derbyshire Healthcare NHS FoundationTrust, Derby, UK,5Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Nottingham, UKCaloric restriction interventions - such as very-low energy diets – and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs) are effective methods of inducing significant weight loss. Both have robust evidence supporting their efficacy and are widely utilised for the management of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, concerns exist regarding the potential loss of muscle mass with these interventions, and there is considerable inconsistency in the literature on this topic. We present two meta-analyses we undertook to quantify the changes in measures of muscle mass (MM), related to alterations in fat mass (FM) and total body weight (TBW). Both reviews were conducted in accordance with the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidance, and were registered on the International prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO 2022 registration numbers CRD42024542940 and CRD42023489617). The primary outcome for both reviews was any measure of MM (lean body mass – LBM, fat free mass – FFM, skeletal muscle mass – SMM), with FM and TBW as secondary outcomes. Review 1 examined the effect of caloric restriction interventions up to 900 kilocalories per day on measures of MM, whilst review 2 focussed on GLP1RAs. Review 1 included 49 studies involving 4785 participants, and 38 studies with 1735 participants were reported in review 2. Caloric restriction resulted in significant reduction in MM, across populations with and without T2D alike. In contrast, GLP1RAs did not elicit significant MM reductions in individuals with T2D, although there was significant reduction observed in individuals without T2D. Both interventions caused significantly greater reductions in FM than MM across both populations. The proportion of weight loss induced by caloric restriction comprising of MM was approximately 26%, whilst the corresponding figure with GLP1RAs was lower at approximately 18%. In conclusion, significant reduction in measures of MM were observed with both interventions, particularly in individuals without T2D. However, the losses of MM were significantly lower than FM. Notably, the proportion of weight loss attributable to MM appeared to be considerably lower with GLP1RAs compared to caloric restriction interventions, suggesting a potential muscle preserving effect of GLP1RAs.Disclosures:One contributing author (A.A) was the recipient of the Novo Nordisk UK Research Foundation (Registered Charity number 1056410), Research Fellow Scholarship.

Differences in eating behaviour traits have been associated with body weight and food intake. However, evidence is mixed, and the direction of association is not always clear. The Fenland cohort (N = 12,435) investigates the interaction between environmental and genetic factors in determining obesity, type 2 diabetes, and related metabolic disorders and includes adults born between 1950 and 1975 recruited from Cambridgeshire general practices. This secondary analysis aims to explore the bidirectional associations between eating behaviour and body mass index (BMI), and adiposity. Analyses will include a subset of participants from the Fenland cohort (n = 7830) who provided data at phase 1 (collected from 2005 to 2015) and phase 2 (collected from 2014 to 2020). Bivariate latent change score models will test dynamic changes between eating behaviour traits assessed using the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (emotional eating, uncontrolled eating, and cognitive restraint) and BMI (kg/m2) and body fat percentage (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)) from phase 1 to 2 using maximum likelihood estimation. Such models are powerful analytic methods that allow for exploring cross-domain coupling, that captures the extent to which change in one domain (e.g. eating behaviour) is a function of the starting level in the other domain (e.g. BMI, body fat percentage), and vice versa. Separate models will be fit for each eating behaviour trait and BMI, and for each eating behaviour trait and body fat percentage. Models will be adjusted to account for biological sex, age, household income, education, physical activity expenditure, phase 1 BMI, phase 1 body fat percentage, and clustering by study site. Model fit will be assessed (RMSEA < 0.05, SRMR < 0.08, CFI > 0.95). Preliminary analyses have been completed and full analysis will be completed within the next two months. Findings will provide insights into the direction of association between eating behaviour traits and BMI and adiposity, which can inform understanding of the role of eating behaviour traits in the development and maintenance of obesity and their potential as targets for prevention and treatment strategies.Disclosures:The Fenland Study is funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC).

The YOUTH study aimed to address the need for more comprehensive cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence, by tracking eating behaviours, mental health, health-related behaviours and weight over a 12-month period, in a sample of young adults (18–35 years) across UK and Australia. The Prolific platform was used to recruit participants across BMI (20–24.9; 25–29.9; 30–34.9; 35–39.9; ≥40 kg/m2) and sex categories, with ~4:1 ratio of UK to Australian participants. Online surveys were administered via Prolific at baseline, 6 and 12 months. The survey measured demographics, the impact of COVID-19, BMI, weight management and health service usage, eating behaviours, personality, mental health, and health-related behaviours. At each time point, participants were also given the option of uploading an image capturing their weight on a set of scales, with the aim of validating self-reported weight in the main survey. The cohort consisted of 507 participants at baseline (49.5% female; mean age 27.9 years), with a retention rate of 73% and 66% at 6 and 12-month follow-up, respectively. Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data revealed significant differences in the levels of overall health, anxiety, depression, food addiction, disordered eating and eating in response to positive and negative emotions across BMI categories, with higher BMI categories generally associated with more negative outcomes. Key differences across males and females were also observed. Longitudinal analysis over 12 months of the bi-directional relationship between weight and eating behaviours, and weight and mental health revealed significant relationships over time for weight with disordered eating, eating in response to positive emotions, and quality of life, with no significant differences identified in these relationships between males and females. Relationships between weight and addictive eating, eating in response to negative emotions, stress, anxiety and depression over time did not reach significance. The YOUTH study makes an important contribution to the evidence base by unravelling some of the complexities in the relationships between weight, eating behaviour, mental health and wellbeing in young adults.Disclosures:L.E. receives funding from MRC, NIHR, Oliver Bird, OHID.

This work explored the perceptions of and current practice around dark kitchens and the regulatory environment from multiple stakeholder perspectives, including consumers (n = 2,023), and those working in local authorities (n = 36) and the food sector (n = 9). The project applied mixed methods approaches, utilising a cross-sectional survey with consumers and a series of interviews and focus groups across participant groups, to explore the definition, identification and regulation of dark kitchens. Whilst most (n = 26, 72%) participants working in local authority teams were aware of dark kitchens, consumers were less aware of these businesses (n = 496, 25%). Results show confusion and inconsistencies in the way that consumers, local authority departments and other stakeholders define and identify dark kitchens. There are also inconsistencies in how local authorities regulate dark kitchens, partly as “they do sort of go under the radar a little bit and they’re very difficult to find…” (participant working in environmental health), resulting in current nutrition and obesity policy being difficult to implement. As such, understanding of the impact dark kitchens are having on public health is limited: “What we’re trying to do is make our environments healthier […] with our takeaway guidance, we look at proximity to schools, child obesity, deprivation, proliferation […] impact on the health and well-being of the population […] but it’s a completely different story with online deliveries...” (participant working in public health). Where local authorities worked cross-departmentally, a more consistent approach to regulating dark kitchens was observed. The potential risks of dark kitchens to food safety, food hypersensitivities and public health agendas are not fully known and warrant further research and policy development.Disclosures:This project was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) under an Application Development Award (grant reference number: NIHR160326). Sarah Mounsey1*, Michael Clark1, Ben Amies-Cull1, Pete Scarborough11University of Oxford, Oxford, UKTackling risk factors for noncommunicable disease (NCD), including overweight and obesity, is an acknowledged public health priority for the UK government. Increasingly, there is also interest among researchers to situate interventions that target these risk factors and healthy dietary consumption within the wider food system to positively impact environment targets. However, robust evidence on long-term population health and sustainability impacts of such interventions remains limited. This study models the long-term health and environmental impacts of food system interventions that promote healthier, more equitable and sustainable diets across diverse real-world settings in England. The study is part of the SALIENT Consortium, a collaboration between eight UK universities and food system partners from retail, catering, and community support sectors. Interventions were co-designed and trialled to identify what works, for whom, under what conditions, and why. We use the PRIMEtime model—a proportional multistate life table model—to estimate long-term impacts on the incidence, prevalence, mortality, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and healthcare costs of 19 obesity-related diseases, including cardiovascular conditions, diabetes, and nine types of cancer. Epidemiological data are drawn from the Global Burden of Disease database. Changes in food sales data from the trials are translated into population-level consumption of calories, salt, fruit and vegetables, and processed meat. We model business-as-usual against scenarios of: (1) interventions delivered to trial populations only, and (2) interventions scaled up and sustained across the life course of the current UK population. While final modelling results will be available before the congress, the model structure and inputs reflect an up-to-date and realistic synthesis of trial data and cross-sectoral intervention design for potential health and environmental benefits. This study provides timely evidence on the population-level impacts of embedding dietary interventions for diet-related NCD prevention within the UK food system. It highlights the potential of multi-setting, scalable approaches to reduce diet-related disease burden while supporting broader health equity and environmental goals. Findings will inform future food policy and obesity prevention strategies at both local and national levels.Disclosures:SALIENT Consortium receives funding from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Aleks Saunders1*, Nathan Critchlow2, Katrina Brown1, Kimberley Neve11Cancer Research UK, London, UK,2University of Stirling, Stirling, UKThe National Child Measurement Programme shows that 26.8% of children aged 2–15 years are living with overweight or obesity in England. The consumption of high fat, salt, and sugar (HFSS) products is associated with various factors, including marketing. Increasing evidence shows that exposure to digital marketing is prominent in young people’s lives and can influence attitudes and consumption patterns. The social media platform offers unique strengths over traditional marketing such as low cost, tailored audience targeting, and engagement opportunities. This study therefore explores young people’s awareness and engagement with HFSS product marketing - among other age-restricted products - on social media, and their perceptions of future policy options. The study recruited 11–21-year-olds across the UK in two parts. First, a quantitative survey of 4,049 participants, and second, qualitative self-ethnographies and focus groups with 46 and 43 participants, respectively. The survey examined social media use, product consumption, marketing awareness, and policy opinions of HFSS products. The qualitative study provided deeper insights into these areas and explored attitudes and awareness in more detail. The study found that HFSS product marketing was highly recognised and engaged with by young people on social media. Over half of the survey respondents reported seeing HFSS product posts from businesses and influencers online and all participants in the qualitative study spoke of seeing and/or engaging with this content. The qualitative study highlighted the types of HFSS content seen in social media feeds, including restaurant posts and sponsored food reviews. Content was often perceived positively for its entertainment value, and several said they felt hungry or tempted after seeing HFSS content. Participants spoke about influencer-generated content being harder to identify as marketing compared to business posts. They expressed doubt about the effectiveness of current regulations; however, participants also generally showed low desire for further restrictions on HFSS product marketing. In conclusion, HFSS product marketing is highly prevalent and welcomed by young people on social media. There is a need for stricter online regulation, whilst information about commercial determinants and the influence of HFSS products should be adequately communicated to young people.Disclosures:None Katharine Pidd1*, Luke Wilson1, Robert Pryce1, Damon Morris1, Alan Brennan1, Helen Moore2, Amelia Lake2, Andrea Burrows2, Christian Reynolds3, Rebecca Wells3, Christina Vogel3, Natalie Connor2, Penny Breeze11University Of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK,2Teesside University, Middlesbrough, UK,3City St George’s, University of London, London, UKFood taxes can adjust imbalances in healthy and unhealthy food prices. This modelling study estimated changes in consumption and the resulting health and economic outcomes across three hypothetical food tax policy scenarios for the UK. Three tax policies were formulated following literature review, media analysis and interviews with input from stakeholders on acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness. A UK representative synthetic population aged 5–100 was generated using the Health Survey for England and the National Diet and Nutrition Survey to provide consumption across 50 food groups correlated with personal characteristics. Microsimulation modelling simulates the price elasticities of demand and substitution effects estimated using the Living Cost and Food Survey to estimate post-policy consumption. Changes in nutrient intake are translated to permanent changes in weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), cholesterol and HbA1c, using established models. Health events including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancers, osteoarthritis, dementia and mortality are predicted annually for adults conditional on health status. Dental health was conditional on sugar intake in adults and children. Lifetime quality adjusted life years, National Health Service costs and social care costs were determined by health outcomes. The long-term outcomes, discounted at 3.5%, were compared between policies. The three tax policy scenarios include an extension of the Sugary Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) to cakes, confectionary and milk drinks; a targeted levy on sugar and salt; and a 20% tax on unhealthy foods defined by their Nutrient Profile score. All three scenarios estimated mixed impacts on nutritional intake. Weight loss from reduced calorie intake was countered by increased cardiometabolic risks due to changes in salt, saturated fat intake and fibre consumption. Therefore, the reduction in risk of health events like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease were mitigated by unintended nutritional consequences. A policy targeting a limited number of high sugar foods was associated with less health benefit than a broader tax on high sugar and salt foods. Tax policies can shift consumption, change nutritional intake and improve health outcomes. Complimentary policies, such as subsidies for fruit and vegetables, may reduce negative unintended consequences of food taxes.Disclosures:The work is part of the HEALTHEI project, NIHR grant ref: NIHR133927.

Heinen3, Laura McGowan11Queen’s University Belfast, Belfast, UK,2University College London, London, UK,3Univesrity College Dublin, Dublin, IrelandLimited public support for obesity policies can hinder implementation. Therefore, it is critical to fully consider public perceptions of these policies. Approaches focused on individual agency have not managed to adequately address rising levels of obesity globally. One way to understand influences on diet and physical activity behaviours is to view policies and interventions through a behavioural science lens, using frameworks like the COM-B (Capability, Opportunity, Motivation–Behaviour) model. This study aimed to use the COM-B Framework as a guide to qualitatively analyse public views, perceptions and personal experiences of obesity policies (of which weight management services are a component) on the Island of Ireland. Nine semi-structured focus groups with adult participants of mixed gender and socio-economic status were conducted online (n = 64). Analysis of transcripts using COM-B as a framework involved coding participant quotes under capability, opportunity, and motivation regarding weight management-related behaviours. Whether the view expressed was a public perception or a personal experience was noted. Transcripts were double-coded. Most barriers/facilitators to managing weight identified by participants aligned with the COM-B constructs of physical opportunity (e.g., cost of healthy diet/exercise, the type of food environment people are exposed to, and a lack of weight management supports available) and reflective motivation (e.g., personal experiences of motivation to exercise). Reflective motivation was often linked to physical opportunity in examples given by participants. For children and young people, the importance of acquiring cooking skills (physical capability) and the government implementing measures to limit exposure to unhealthy food advertising (influencing automatic motivation) were seen as potential facilitators of weight management. Participants identified potential areas for improvement in obesity policy and services) across all constructs of the COM-B Model. Public perceptions in this study however, mainly focussed on targeting physical opportunities in the food and physical environment, with this being seen to have subsequent implications for motivation in relation to weight management behaviours. The COM-B analysis highlighted the need for policies to address multiple levels of influence on behaviour, including broader environmental factors that shape opportunities and motivation for healthy behaviours.Disclosures:None Fiona Quigley1*, Raymond Bond1, Anne Moorhead11Ulster University, Belfast, UKHealthcare professionals (HCPs) often report feeling underprepared and a lack of confidence about initiating weight-related discussions with patients. Despite available training, many HCPs continue to find these conversations difficult as most current training is a one-off learning experience, lacking scalable hands-on practice with multiple scenarios. Evidence shows the topic of weight is often avoided, even though patients express the need for support with overweight and obesity. There is growing interest in how artificial intelligence (AI) can support continuous experiential learning for HCPs. Conversational agents (AI-powered chatbots) offer a novel approach to practising sensitive communication skills in a safe, scalable environment. This project aimed to design and demonstrate a training chatbot prototype, VITAL-COMS, (Virtual Training and Assessment Tool for Communication Skills) to support healthcare professionals to practice evidence-based and empathetic conversations with people living with overweight or obesity. This research design is a prototype chatbot development. VITAL-COMS was originally developed as a 3D simulation tool using Unity software as part of a doctoral project, where communication challenges were explored and core evidence-based communication strategies were identified, including motivational interviewing, uncovering ambivalence, communication misalignment, affirming autonomy, and using person-first, stigma-aware language. This prototype 2 is built using OpenAI’s custom GPT framework to enable more realistic, dynamic and scalable interactions. The communication strategies identified in the original prototype were used to guide the structure and language of the chatbot. VITAL-COMS enables HCPs to role-play clinical conversations with the chatbot acting as a simulated patient, offering naturalistic dialogue and in-the-moment feedback. Scenario customisation, reflection prompts, and teach-back moments are built in to support active learning. On-going feedback from early testers and the project advisory group suggests the tool is engaging, accessible, and useful for building communication confidence. During tool demonstrations, sample interactions show how the chatbot responds to different communication approaches in real time. Features such as empathy nudges, language suggestions, and gentle corrections are included. VITAL-COMS highlights the potential of conversational AI to enhance training in weight-related communication by combining lived experience, communication science, and scalable technology. Further piloting is planned to evaluate its impact on clinicians’ communication skills, confidence, and reflective practice.Disclosures:None Sebastian Braithwaite1*, Lojana Chandrarajan2, Amina Khanam21Lewisham Hospital, London, UK,2University Hospital Lewisham, London, UKThe number of bariatric surgeries increases yearly, with the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery estimating a rise from 158,000 in 2011 to 270,000 in 2023. As the population of post-bariatric surgery patients grows, so too does the number of these patients who are women of childbearing age. This is key when considering the identification of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in these patients. The current NICE guidelines recommend two methods of diagnosing GDM: self-monitoring glucose and two oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs), particularly in high-risk women. Usually with former taking place after the first booking, and the latter between 24 to 28 weeks of gestation. Pregnant women who have undergone bariatric surgery often have delayed gastric emptying and absorption, which subsequently interferes with the results of these tests. We present a case of a late diagnosis of GDM in a primiparous 33-year-old Caucasian female who underwent sleeve gastrectomy a decade prior. At initial booking her BMI was 39 kg/m2, indicating high risk for GDM. HbA1c was also measured at 32 mmol/mol. Subsequent OGTT at 24–28 weeks was negative for GDM, however due clinical suspicion further investigations were carried out. Blood glucose monitoring revealed an unusually high fasting glucose of >9 mmol/L and 1-hour post-prandial blood glucose levels of >8 mmol/L, demonstrating GDM. Fortunately, foetal scans were negative for both macrosomia and placental insufficiency. She was subsequently commenced on a BD metformin regime, and further home glucose testing was within normal range. As previously outlined in the BMJ’s ‘Pregnancy After Bariatric Surgery: Screening for Gestational Diabetes’, this case clearly highlights the lack of sensitivity of the OGTT in post-bariatric surgery pregnancies. This poses an increased risk of adverse health outcomes associated with GDM. Whilst in this case there was no resultant macrosomia, the delayed diagnosis indicates that current guidelines are not adequate at diagnosing GDM in this unique patient population. These false negatives delay adequate and timely treatment, leading directly to detrimental patient health outcomes. We propose post-bariatric surgery pregnancies should tested be for GDM via regular glucose home monitoring to provide optimal treatment and prevent morbidity.Disclosures:None Heather Hopper1*, Kerryn Husk1, Kate Maslin1, Jill Shawe11University Of Plymouth, Plymouth, UKPeople living with obesity have a greater chance of developing complications during pregnancy and are over-represented in maternal mortality data relating to both direct and indirect causes during pregnancy and up to a year after the birth of their child. In addition, epigenetic influences result in metabolic changes in offspring of people living with obesity leading to a greater chance of them experiencing long-term health consequences. In view of these health concerns, people living with obesity are advised to lose weight in the preconception period, before becoming pregnant. Sustained weight loss, however, can be difficult to achieve, and people do not always seek preconception advice. The aim of this study was to explore what form of preconception care for people with health conditions, including those living with obesity, works, for whom, how, and in what circumstances. Realist methodology was used to identify causal explanations, involving consideration of unobservable processes or powers. A realist evaluation involved 31 qualitative interviews with relevant stakeholders: women living with health conditions (n = 20), including those living with obesity (n = 3), their partners or supporting family members (n = 2), and healthcare professionals involved in providing preconception care (n = 9). The multi-stage realist evaluation generated 13 refined middle-range theories, providing causal explanations of what works for whom, and how. Of these, one specifically relates to achieving support to improve preconception health for people living with obesity. The mechanisms identified involve resources that include monitoring and treatment, and reasoning that reduces feelings of guilt or blame, facilitating effective communication between the person living with obesity and their healthcare professional. This is the first study of preconception care for people with health conditions, including people living with obesity, using a realist approach. The findings identified obesity as an outlier, when compared with health conditions such as diabetes or epilepsy, which are monitored, treated, and for which preconception care is offered by healthcare professionals. It provides a causal explanation of how preconception health could be improved by including obesity as a health condition and emphasises the importance of treating people with kindness and respect.Disclosures:None Emma Hunter1*, Marta Lonnie2, Flora Douglas11Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, UK,2The Rowett Institute, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UKWith co-production at its heart, the Food Insecurity in people living with Obesity (FIO) Food project unites academics, retailers, policymakers and individuals with lived experience, including patient and public involvement (PPI) groups, to support people living with obesity (PLWO) and food insecurity (FI), purchase healthy and sustainable food from the supermarket. The value of PPI in shaping study design, procedures, data interpretation and dissemination is widely recognised. FIO Food researchers have strived to ensure meaningful PPI inclusion throughout the research process. As the project draws to a close, we reflect on the invaluable contribution of our PPI partners. Our FIO Food PPI groups played a crucial role informing the qualitative research undertaken as part of the project, steering study design, recently identifying a key area for further investigation, not immediately recognised by the research team. Their input also guided study procedures to improve participant engagement, recruitment and the collection of relevant data. PPI partners have been instrumental in ‘sense checking’ researcher interpretations of the qualitative findings to establish whether these interpretations align with those with the lived experience. To ensure their voices are heard, PPI partners have contributed to stakeholder workshops which informed the development of a White Paper outlining recommendations for policy and health care to address underlying economic factors contributing to FI and obesity. Their lived experience has been documented and included in the recent UK Government Food Security Report. Additionally, recorded interviews with our PPI partners, within which they discuss their lived experiences of LWO and FI, will feature in upcoming events, planned for later this year, at both the Scottish Parliament and in Westminster, to maximise the project’s impact. PPI participants have reflected on their time in the FIO Food project as ‘empowering’ and ‘dignifying’, offering an opportunity to challenge societal misconceptions that obesity and FI stem solely from an individual’s life choices. The FIO Food project stands as a testament to the benefits of co-production and demonstrates how meaningful collaboration with those with lived experience can enhance research quality.Disclosures:None Hannah Greatwood1,2*, Emma Hunter2, Thomas Sawzcuk1,2,4, Flora Douglas2, Mark S.

People who experience food insecurity are more likely to live with obesity, yet little is known about how these challenges shape everyday food-shopping practices. This qualitative study offers insights from people living with obesity and food insecurity, from an ethnically diverse urban community, into how they navigate the rising cost of food while attempting to reduce their weight. We conducted a secondary analysis of transcripts from four focus groups (8–11 participants per group; 92% female) comprising 39 adults who self-reported as living with obesity and food insecurity and are actively trying to lose weight. Using a deductive thematic framework, we identified three overarching themes and eight subthemes that capture participants’ strategies, constraints, and tensions. 1. ‘The Conscious Consumer’ reflects the deliberate preparation and planning participants employ to stretch limited budgets. Subthemes include advanced meal planning, and price-comparison shopping. Despite these efforts, participants frequently encountered barriers to procuring nutritionally balanced foods. 2. ‘The Restricted Consumer’ highlights how structural and systemic limitations, such as time pressures due to work or caregiving responsibilities, further constrained participants’ purchasing choices. 3. ‘The Mitigating Rising Costs’ describes the coping mechanisms participants adopted in response to persistent price inflation. Subthemes include substituting affordable, less-healthy products for costlier fresh produce and bulk buying of staple items. Across all themes, participants reported significant cognitive dissonance: they recognised the poorer nutritional quality of budget-friendly foods yet felt obliged by their financial constraints to choose them. These findings challenge prevailing assumptions that individuals on low incomes simply need to budget more effectively to eat healthily. Instead, they reveal the deeply constrained choices that food-insecure individuals face and the emotional toll of making what they perceive to be less-healthy decisions. By illuminating the lived experiences, this study offers critical evidence to inform interventions and policies aimed at promoting healthy, sustainable food purchasing. These insights are essential for guiding efforts to transform the UK food system toward greater equity.Disclosures:MSG is a director of Causal Insights Solutions Ltd, which provides causal inference training and may benefit from any study that demonstrates the value of causal inference methods.

Victoria To1*1King’s College London, UKFood insecurity, encompassing an interplay of socioeconomic, dietary, and lifestyle factors is recognised as a critical moderator of paediatric obesity outcomes. However, the precise magnitude of this relationship remains understudied, necessitating investigation to elucidate its impact. This study employs spatiotemporal modelling to analyse the relationship between food insecurity and childhood obesity across London’s boroughs, focusing on children aged 11–12 (Year 6). Data was sourced from the London Datastore, Office for National Statistics, and NHS England for 2018–2023. A Geographically Temporal Weighted Regression model was applied, accounting for temporal dependencies and spatial interactions with the two nearest neighbouring boroughs. The model demonstrated moderate predictive capacity (R2= 0.582, p < 0.05), explaining 58.2% of the variance in obesity prevalence among Year 6 children. Statistically significant associations (p < 0.1) were revealed between childhood obesity and two explanatory variables: free school meal program eligibility (p < 2e-16) and median weekly household income (p = 0.071). Meanwhile, the relationship between childhood obesity and two other explanatory variables was statistically insignificant: density of fast-food restaurants per 100,000 (p = 0.1584) and food parcels delivered per 100,000 (p = 0.3179). Covariates, including green space access and exercise levels, demonstrated statistically significant relationships (p < 0.1). Residual analysis revealed spatial heterogeneity in model performance across London boroughs. Positive residues, reflecting underprediction, were most pronounced in Greenwich (1.13) and Wandsworth (0.66). Negative residues were most significant in Camden (−0.53) and Richmond Upon Thames (−0.59). The model showed the strongest performances in Islington (0.01) and Ealing (−0.06). Getis-Ord statistics revealed hotspots and cold spots, demonstrating high and low-fidelity prediction zones respectively. Strong model performance clusters were observed around Hillingdon (W) and Hackney (E), while clusters of weak model performance were identified around Lewisham (SE) and Bexley (E). In conclusion, this study presents a statistical model of moderate strength in predicting childhood obesity prevalence. These findings suggest that targeted interventions could be optimised by focusing on areas that showed a strong relationship between food insecurity and childhood obesity. Future research should incorporate additional variables, such as access to fresh produce and household food budget, to enhance model precision.Disclosures:None Nika Pajda1*, Caitlin Mahoney1, Mark Green21Bite Back, London, UK,2University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UKBite Back is a charity working with passionate young activists who want to change the food system to one that protects children’s health. Young people have shared their experience of being bombarded by unhealthy food and drink advertising every time they step outside. The aim of the research was to support their insights with evidence. Bite Back partnered with the University of Liverpool to explore the extent of outdoor advertising for food and non-alcoholic drink across four UK Local Authority (LA) Districts – Liverpool, Southwark (London), Birmingham and Newcastle upon Tyne. Data collection was conducted over a two-week period in February 2025 via bicycle using a GoPro Max 360 degree camera to capture all outdoor adverts. The images were processed using a deep learning model to build street view datasets of food and drink adverts in each location. The dataset was manually coded by surface type, brand, product advertised and type of business. Nutrition information was collected to determine whether a product was high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS). The geo-location of each advert was used to assess the density of adverts by deprivation and proximity to schools. Of the 333 adverts featuring a food or drink product, the majority (190, 57%) featured at least one HFSS item. The prevalence of HFSS adverts in Southwark, the only LA surveyed with a healthier advertising policy, was lowest (28, 38%). McDonald’s was the most frequent advertiser representing 31% of all food and drink adverts. Advertising was unequal with 44% of all HFSS adverts in the most deprived quintile, and 4% were found in the least deprived quintile. In three locations, no adverts of any type were captured in the least deprived area. 35% of schools had at least one HFSS advert within a short walk from their gates (400 m). This analysis suggests that local policies to restrict unhealthy outdoor food advertising can make an impact but national action is needed to protect the private advertising spaces which local policies currently can’t reach. The research adds to the evidence base showing the overwhelming presence of unhealthy outdoor advertising in the UK.Disclosures:None Karen Coulman1*, Justine Womack2, Carly Atkinson3, Briony Caffrey4, Alison Tavaré5, Nicola Powell6, Roz Erskine-Gray7, Rachel Roberts8, Nick Pugh8, Amanda Owen-Smith11University Of Bristol, Bristol, UK,2Office for Health Improvement and Disparities, London, UK,3Gloucestershire Health and Care NHS Foundation Trust, Gloucester, UK,4Cornwall Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, Bodmin, UK,5Health Innovation West of England, Bristol, UK,6NHS England South West, Taunton, UK,7Parent carer representative, UK,8The Brandon Trust, Bristol, UKAdults with learning disabilities die 20 years earlier than the general adult population with heart disease a main cause of avoidable deaths. Obesity, a key risk factor, is more prevalent in this group. Support from carers can be vital for adults with learning disabilities to engage with and maintain healthy behaviours, however, appropriate training for carers is lacking. This research aimed to develop free nationally available e-learning for carers on supporting healthy weight in adults with learning disabilities. Methods included: 1) Content analysis of key professional resources to promote healthy weight in people with learning disabilities, 2) Qualitative interviews with health and social care managers, clinical leads, and commissioners to identify carer barriers in supporting healthy weight in people with learning disabilities and areas of training need, 3) Qualitative interviews and focus groups with paid and unpaid carers to refine training content. Thematic analysis of interview and focus group transcripts was undertaken to identify key themes. Twenty-five individuals (social care n = 15, healthcare n = 5, family carer n = 3, public health professional n = 1, social enterprise staff n = 1) took part in 19 interviews and two focus groups. Carers were described as holding ‘a lot of power’ to demonstrate and support healthy behaviours. Key barriers included workforce pressures, carer beliefs, knowledge and skills related to healthy behaviours, habits around food as a reward, and perceived tensions between supporting choice and healthier behaviours. Carer training needs were categorised into three main areas forming the basis of e-learning sessions: 1) Understanding factors contributing to excess weight in people with learning disabilities, 2) Understanding the basics of healthy eating and physical activity recommendations, and 3) Understanding how to apply this knowledge when working with a person with a learning disability. The research team worked with a learning disability charity ‘experts by experience’ group to develop lived experience videos of individuals’ journeys towards healthier weight included within the e-learning. Carers play a key role in supporting healthy behaviours in people with learning disabilities.

However, in the past decade, Nigeria has seen a rising trend in overweight and obesity among children under the age of five years. This study addressed: (i) the individual, parental, household, and community predictors of overweight/obesity; (ii) the relative importance of these predictors; and (iii) the interactions among these factors affecting the overweight and obesity status of Nigerian children under five. We conducted a secondary analysis of a representative sample of the 2018 Nigerian Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) data. Using a two-state multilevel logistic analysis, we assessed predictors by nesting individual (child, parental, and household) characteristics at level 1 within communities at level 2. We evaluated three models, performed a dominance post-estimation analysis for ranking regressors’ importance in multilevel settings, and utilised marginal analysis for interaction effects. Children are classified with overweight or obesity if their weight-for-height Z-score exceeds two standard deviations (+2SD) above the reference population’s median. The study analysed a weighted sample of 11,731 children under 60 months, with a mean age of 28.37. The prevalence of overweight/obesity was found to be 2.00%. The optimal model included individual, parental, and household variables (Interclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) = 20.24%, Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) = 1203, and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) = 1509). Significant predictors included the child’s age, birth size, recent cough, maternal education level, maternal body mass index (BMI), residence in the northeast geopolitical zone, and household size (more than four sleeping rooms). Maternal BMI emerged as the most critical predictor (standardised dominance stat (SDS) = 1.005), followed by the child’s age (SDS = 0.106) and regional status (SDS = 0.05). Notably, there were significant interactions between maternal overweight or obesity, and children’s age, specifically at 12–23 months (AOR = 3.66, p < 0.022 95%CI [1.21,11.13]), and 24–35 months (AOR = 3.83, p < 0.023, 95%CI [1.20,12.20]), indicating that the effects of maternal BMI on children’s overweight/obesity status vary with the child’s age.

Advancing understanding of the causal inter-relationships of key influences on obesity development in young children through systems mapping is needed. An iterative stakeholder engagement approach was taken to create a systems map, starting with a workshop with n = 23 stakeholders in the UK to produce an initial map (Phase 1). A further discussion group with six parents refined the map (Phase 2), and a workshop with n = 22 additional stakeholders in NI was used to inform the final map (Phase 3). This abstract reports Phase 3 outcomes. The aim of Phase 3 was to build upon the map, consider any omissions and discuss it from an NI perspective with early years organisations/NI government departments/ public health staff/ healthcare practitioners/ commissioners/ charities/ community organisations and parents. The workshop involved an introduction to the map outlining the domains, nodes, and connections to prompt discussion followed by a weightings exercise, where participants indicated nodes/domains on the map of greatest importance regarding the development of excess weight in 0–5 year olds. The final map contained 20 domains of influence and 153 factors. Several new nodes were suggested in Phase 3 relating to behaviours e.g., screen time and physical activity (lack of fundamental movement skills); cultural factors e.g., norms around babies weight gain and a lack of breastfeeding culture; environmental factors such as predominance of unhealthy food choices for children eating out of home; and, psychological factors e.g., stigma of childhood overweight/obesity. There was an emphasis on importance of parental mental health, inequalities, poverty and income. Inadequate government policies and a lack of NI government stability were also prominent and linked directly to insufficient funding for early years services, particularly in rural areas which lack services for large proportions of the NI population. Findings illustrate multiple interacting influences on excess weight gain in 0–5 year olds and findings should be used to contextualise future intervention development.Disclosures:None Mackenzie Fong1,2, Lorraine McSweeney1*, Charlotte Rothwell11Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK,2NIHR Applied Research Collaboration (North East and North Cumbria), Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UKIn the UK, rates of obesity are higher in people from minority ethnic groups, men, people living with serious mental illness, people living in more deprived areas, and those with a physical or learning disability. Targeted tier 2 weight management services aim to offer tailored support to these groups in a way that is sensitive to their specific needs. Our qualitative study aimed to explore the experiences of service users from higher-risk groups of engaging with targeted tier 2 services. We used a multi-case study design involving five tier 2 providers. We purposive sampled participants within case studies to ensure a diverse range of experiences were explored. One-to-one interviews and framework analysis were informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. We interviewed 28 service users and one carer. Participants attended targeted services for men (n = 7), people with serious mental illness (n = 3), people living in more deprived areas (n = 8), and people living with a learning disability (n = 11). Several commonalities across the service user experience were identified, including: the need for personalised initial contact before the first session; having continuity of staff delivering the programme; holding sessions in a familiar and accessible venue; and the value of non-weight benefits of attending the service such as improvements to social and mental wellbeing. Participants held mixed views on the duration and costs of the programmes. While some participants reported that 12-weeks was sufficient to promote behavioural change, others said it was not long enough, especially for individuals facing issues such as poverty. We also gleaned learning related to specific targeted groups, for example, male specific programmes were reported to fill a gap in a market that was perceived to be dominated by feminised programmes. These programmes successfully engaged men through use of male-specific image and branding. We also identified that service users living with mental illness may benefit from accessing one-to-one support, rather than group-based programmes. Our study presents findings that can be used by service commissioners and providers to enhance the experience of service users from higher-risk groups when engaging with targeted tier 2 weight management services.Disclosures:None Maria Bryant2*, Alexis Foster1, Alicia O’Cathain1, Philip Garnett2, Wendy Burton2, Michelle Collinson3, Dawn Groves-Williams3, Laura McGowan4, Aoibhin Kelly, Lauren Surtees5, Adam Martin3, Bethan Copsey31University of York, York, UK,2University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK,3University of Leeds, Leeds, UK,4Queens University, Belfast, UK,5Member of the Public, Leeds, UKThe Foresight obesity Map describes factors and relationships that influence appetite regulation in adults. Not only did Foresight highlight the importance of complex systems, it sparked policy change. To our knowledge, there is not a map focused on young children, where unique parent/setting factors may operate. We aimed to co-develop a systems map to identify key factors contributing to excess weight gain in 0–5 year olds. We hosted two workshops with 45 stakeholders in the UK (childcare practitioners, academics, parents, public health specialists, commissioners). Using a group model building approach, participants were asked to consider factors they felt influenced excess weight gain and to start drawing maps in groups. Vignettes of young families were then used to encourage additional thinking (particularly focused on inequalities). We then asked participants to discuss (and draw) relationships between factors. In order to get a sense of perceived importance, participants were asked to signify factors they felt were most influential by applying stickers onto all group maps. After the workshops, we collated maps into a single map. Iterations were made following participant feedback and a parent advisory group discussion. Following review by the immediate team (authors), it was apparent that key factors were omitted (likely due to the roles of participants). To ensure completeness, we conducted a rapid and specific literature review, (including obesity and child development frameworks and policies) to further refine the map. The final map included 153 interacting factors and six embedded levels: (1) Child (e.g. physiology, demographics, health/social needs); (2) Parents (e.g. income/resources, mental health, parenting style/skills); (3) Family and social networks (e.g. wider family and friends); (4) Local factors (e.g. physical environment, childcare access, early years services, local government services); (5) National factors (e.g. government policies/funding, food suppliers, retailers, societal pressures) and (6) Global factors (e.g. events affecting food supply/prices). This map can support the development of prevention policies/interventions. We also intend to use it within a RCT: exploring the degree to which the effectiveness of an obesity prevention intervention is affected by wider system factors.Disclosures:None Shazana Rifham Abdullah1*, Ahmad Kamil Nur Zati Iwani1, Liyana Ahmad Zamri1, Ruziana Mona Wan Mohd Zin1, Norhashimah Abu Seman1, Nur Azlin Zainal Abidin1, Siti Sarah Hamzah1, Nur Hayati Azizul1, Azahadi Omar1, Zamtira Seman1, Abqariyah Yahya2, Mohd Fairulnizal Md Noh11National Institutes of Health, Ministry of Health, Malaysia,2Universiti Malaya, MalaysiaVisceral adiposity plays a critical role in the development of cardiometabolic diseases. However, the precise amount of visceral fat reduction required to achieve these improvements remains unclear. This study aims to determine the extent of visceral fat area (VFA) loss necessary to observe significant improvements in cardiometabolic outcomes following 12 weeks of dietary interventions: combined intermittent fasting and the healthy plate (IFHP) and the healthy plate (HP) alone. This was a sub-analysis of a non-randomised controlled trial involving adults with overweight and obesity. Body composition, glucose parameters, and lipid profiles were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks of interventions. As data analysis using the general estimating equation revealed no significant differences in the VFA changes between intervention groups, all data were combined for multiple logistic regression analysis to determine the association between VFA loss (no loss, < 5% loss, and ≥ 5% loss) and improvements in cardiometabolic outcomes. For each cardiometabolic outcomes, a change exceeding the minimum value of the third tertile was considered a high improvement. There was a significant reduction of VFA in the IFHP group (mean difference −4.076 cm2, P-value = 0.003), but not in the HP group (mean difference −0.460 cm2, P-value = 0.663). Compared to no VFA loss, a VFA loss of ≥ 5% was significantly associated with greater improvements in waist circumference (AOR 2.97 95% CI 1.16–7.64), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (AOR 4.19, 95% CI 1.58–11.14), triglycerides (AOR 3.01, 95% CI 1.14–7.92), and haemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) (AOR 2.95 95% CI 1.12–7.79). Additionally, those with < 5% VFA loss were four times more likely to show a greater improvement in HDL-C after 12 weeks (AOR 4.08, 95% CI 11.36–12.22). This study found that the magnitude of VFA loss is an independent determinant of improvements in waist circumference, HDL-C, triglycerides, and HbA1C in adults with overweight and obesity. When designing obesity prevention programs, it is essential to establish clear targets for VFA loss to optimise improvements in cardiometabolic outcomes.Disclosures:None Akidah Ayman1*, Laura Holloway1, Josef Toon1,3, Amanda Avery1,2, Jemma Donovan1, Carolyn Pallister11Slimming World, Alfreton, UK,2University of Nottingham, UK,3De Montfort University, Leicester, UKThe prevalence of obesity in young adults is an increasing concern given the strong association between obesity and type 2 diabetes and the complexity of managing early onset T2DM. However young adults are under-represented in data evaluating weight management programmes (WMP) and we do not know if programmes are appropriate and effective for this age-group. This study aimed to explore the accessibility and support that a community WMP provides to young adults. An online survey, hosted on Qualtrics, explored health, wellbeing, self-esteem, physical activity, diet and the social support provided for group and online members. All 18–34-year-olds who had been a member for >4 weeks and were not pregnant, were invited to take part over a 4-week period. Ethical approval was obtained. 3466 responded (n = 204 online; 335 aged 18–24), 93.2% identifying as female and 97.4% as white ethnicity. Mean BMI at baseline was 37.9 ± 7.8 kg/m2with a weight change of −11.4 ± 9.2 %. 35% of respondents joined the WMP with a BMI > 40 kg/m2. Median length of current attendance was 32 weeks. The main reasons for accessing weight management support were to ‘feel better about myself’ (87.7%), ‘improve/protect my physical health’ (78.9%), and ‘gain confidence’ (75.9%). Reasons for choosing the WMP included previous membership (61.7%), not wanting a restrictive diet (39.5%), recommendation from friends/family (37.7%), and liking the sound of the group support (37.7%). Respondents reported gaining confidence in changing their eating habits (91%) and felt supported in changing their mindset about physical activity (80%). There was a shift in confidence to prepare healthier meals from scratch (p < 0.001). Overall, 77% felt able to challenge negative thoughts about losing weight and 57.9% felt their mental wellbeing had improved. The group support was valued (92%) and relatable (90%). The data suggests the community WMP promotes young adult members’ confidence in their ability to manage their weight, supports positive behavioural changes, with additional health benefits. Of surprise was the greater number of young adults accessing in-person group support over online support. Future research should explore the needs of 18–24 years olds who were under-represented in the study population.Disclosures:All authors work full or part-time for Slimming World. Harleen Kapoor1*, Jodi Wood2, James Law2, Pooja Sachdev1,21University Of Nottingham, UK,2Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, UKChildhood obesity is a growing public health concern, associated with multiple long-term health complications. The Complications of Excess Weight (CEW) service is a National Health Service England (NHSE)-funded Tier 3 obesity programme for children under 18 years old. Understanding the growth trajectories of children and young people (CYP) referred prior to being seen helps interpret progression when in the CEW service. We conducted a retrospective analysis of weight and BMI changes in 176 CYP referred to the Nottingham CEW service between January 2021 and April 2024, prior to their first clinic appointment. Obesity-related complications were recorded, along with Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) decile, gender and age. Eighty-five patients (48%) were from the most deprived quintile compared with 15 patients (9%) from the least deprived. At referral, 39 patients (22%) had one or more obesity-related comorbidity, of which 82% were from IMD deciles 1–4. Patients gained 7.7 ± 14.7 kg/year between referral and first appointment (10 ± 6.2 months). Gender was statistically significant in relation to weight velocity from referral to first appointment. Males gained 5.2 kg/year more than females when taking age and IMD decile into account (p < 0.001), but weight gain was not associated with IMD decile or age. Change in BMI SDS was associated with age (0.03 SDS per year) but not IMD decile or gender. In 22 patients with measurements for at least 3 previous years, weight gain was greatest in the second year prior to referral (year before: 7.1 kg, 2nd year before: 17.1 kg, 3rd year before 12.4 kg). Almost half of CYP referred to the Nottingham CEW service were from the lowest IMD quintile and those with obesity-related complications were concentrated in this group. Patients in this group appear to be particularly susceptible to the effects of excess weight, but do not appear to gain weight faster while waiting to be seen. The current waiting times for access to services is associated with clinically significant weight gain. When assessing patient progress in clinic, it is important to consider the trajectory prior to engagement with weight-management services.Disclosures:None AB Sirin Ayva1*, Nadine Heywood1, Alaa Adwan1, James Roast1, Sophie Edwards1, Paul Gately11Morelife UKToday, nearly a third of children aged 2 to 15 are living with overweight or obesity, which has an impact on both physical and mental health. MoreLife delivers tailored, evidence-based and psychologically informed specialist child weight management services (SCWMS) in the UK. Children living with obesity need support in gaining self-esteem and self-acceptance3and the higher risk of depression in children living with obesity or those who are overweight can be partially accounted for by their weight concerns, their perceived isolation from their peers and shame. Despite this, the majority of commissioned Specialist Child Management Services are highly medicalised, neglecting psychological support. MoreLife provides Family (parents and their children) and parent-only groups to families with complex medical, social and psychological needs to help them with healthy lifestyle changes to facilitate weight loss/maintenance. The programmes are designed as 8 biweekly therapeutic group sessions facilitated by an experienced therapist and co-facilitated by an experienced practitioner. Weight, physical activity, diet, screen time, well-being and self-esteem are monitored during the intervention, which lasts a year. We also gather qualitative feedback from the parents after each session. Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ): A 35-item parent-report measure assessing eight dimensions of children’s eating behaviour, including food responsiveness, food enjoyment, emotional eating, satiety responsiveness, food fussiness, slowness in eating, and desire to eat.

The contributing factors to obesity this group includes selective eating patterns, disordered sleep, obesogenic medication, as well as social challenges impacting participation in physical activity. The gold-standard intervention for weight loss in children is family-based intervention. MoreLife, Medway and Swale online weight management service offers 1:1 support for children with a BMI ≥98th centile. Families are given tailored support and advice in line with evidence-based guidance. Sessions are offered weekly for the first 12 weeks, with regular check-ins thereafter. This intervention offers a multidisciplinary approach, with families having access to a specialist nurse, specialist dietitian, registered nutritionist and psychotherapist. Feedback and outcomes were gathered through an online questionnaire sent to parents upon joining the program. This questionnaire included validated tools including the Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (CEBQ). Weight measurement included weight reported by parents. Of the total referrals made to our specialist weight management service, 31 participants (39%) had a diagnosis of ASD or ADHD. Mean age was 11 years, and 58% were males. The responses to initial questionnaire on child eating behaviour recorded that all of these children ‘never’ or ‘rarely’ enjoyed a variety of food, ‘always’ refused new foods at first, and are ‘always’ or ‘often’ difficult to please at mealtimes. The flexible appointment times and remote phone consultations and individualised support facilitated 100 % retention rate, high engagement with their scheduled appointments. Feedback from families of children with CHN reported several positive changes, including increased willingness to try new foods, improved quality and variety of foods, and improved energy and concentration levels at school. Weight measurement outcomes suggested some improvements with weight loss ranging from 2.5–3 Kg. Whilst children living with CHN exhibited common difficulties around food, the service proved effective in cultivating positive changes to promote healthy eating guidelines and established acceptability and feasibility of family-based intervention in this group.Disclosures:None Sarish Zaitha Khan1*, Sanjana Kanumuri1, Zuo Hao Lee2, Vikram Anumakonda31University of Worcester, UK, Worcester, UK,2Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK, Warwick, UK,3Dudley Group NHSFT, UK, Dudley, UKComplex gene-environment interactions, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, are involved in the development of obesity. In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review synthesized evidence from clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov (e.g., NCT03548779), longitudinal human cohorts (ALSPAC, NHANES), rodent models studying germline epigenetic inheritance, and epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) in the GEO database (e.g., GSE104297, GSE124839). Computational analyses using MethylKit and ChIP-seq pipelines mapped epigenetic changes in key metabolic genes (e.g., LEP, POMC, FTO). Key findings revealed: (i) maternal obesity induces persistent LEP hypomethylation (β = −0.18, p < 0.001) and POMC hypermethylation in offspring, disrupting hypothalamic appetite regulation; (ii) paternal high-fat diets alter sperm tsRNAs, dysregulating offspring Mc4r expression in rodents, while grandparental famine in humans correlates with IGF2/H19 methylation changes (OR = 1.42); and (iii) postnatal stressors exacerbate metabolic dysfunction through NR3C1 hypermethylation and diet-induced miR-33a overexpression, which impairs dopaminergic signalling. Interventions demonstrated promise: time-restricted feeding restored CLOCK gene methylation rhythms (Δβ = +0.15), and resveratrol reduced adipogenesis via FTO demethylation. However, challenges include tissue-specific epigenetic variation (blood vs. hypothalamus correlation r = 0.32) and the predominance of observational human studies (78%). Translational barriers persist, as murine models poorly replicate human epigenetic memory. Future research must prioritize longitudinal multi-tissue studies, CRISPR-dCas9 validation of causal epigenetic marks, and combinatorial therapies integrating dietary, pharmacological, and behavioural strategies. Bridging population data, preclinical models, and clinical trials offers a viable pathway to translate epigenetic insights into equitable, effective obesity interventions.Disclosures:None Sarish Zaitha Khan1*, Sanjana Kanumuri1, Zuo Hao Lee2, Vikram Anumakonda31University of Worcester, UK, Worcester, UK,2Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK, Warwick, UK,3Dudley Group NHSFT, UK, Dudley, UKModernization in South America and LMICs has led to paradoxical health outcomes, with economic progress coexisting with persistent inequities in life expectancy and well-being. Using World Bank and WHO datasets (1990–2023), DHS, and FAO food balance sheets, this study examines life expectancy trends, nutrition transitions, and healthcare access disparities quantified via Gini indices. Chile and Costa Rica achieved life expectancies over 80 years through robust primary care, while Bolivia and Paraguay face rural healthcare shortages. The COVID-19 pandemic reversed Brazil’s decades of progress, erasing 1.8 life expectancy years (2020–2021). Rapid urbanization and dietary shifts in urban Peru correlate with a 15% annual diabetes rise, compounding risks alongside sub-Saharan Africa’s dual burden of childhood stunting (30%) and adult female obesity (>20%). Climate stressors, like droughts in Guatemala, worsened acute malnutrition by 34% (8), highlighting disparities with urban elites’ access to privatized healthcare. Brazil’s Family Health Program (FHP) shows scalable solutions, reducing infant mortality by 25% through community-based care (1). Still, systemic gaps remain as transnational corporations market ultra-processed foods to LMICs. Integrated interventions combining drought-resistant crops with primary care expansion could address climate-nutrition synergies. Achieving health equity demands democratizing preventive care, regulating commercial determinants of disease, and fostering multisectoral climate resilience. High-income nations like the UK could adapt Brazil’s FHP model to reduce domestic disparities exacerbated by austerity. Sustainable progress depends on policies that prioritize universal health access and nutritional security over purely economic metrics.References1. Macinko J, et al.

Socio-economic differences in diet are a contributor to dietary health inequalities(1). For brevity, this abstract will report on cross-sectional data on food consumption in Scottish adults. To explore dietary behaviours, we used the National Diet and Nutrition Survey Rolling Program (NDNS RP) dataset, which reports 4-day food and drink records (2). Our focus was on exploring diet quality between different Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation levels (SIMD). Of the 16,908 NDNS records available (years 2008–2019), 2,303 were from Scotland, with 630 records for adults aged 40–70years. Citizens who stated they had dietary restrictions (e.g. consuming vegetarian or weight loss diets) were excluded; there was incomplete data available for SIMD levels, so data is presented for n = 295. We report that those living with the least deprivation (SIMD level 1 grouping) had significantly better Global Diet Quality Scores (GDQS)(3) than those living with the most deprivation (SIMD level 5 grouping; p < 0.001). Based on the GDQS results, a higher percentage of the level 1 group were in the low-risk category for nutrient adequacy and non-communicable disease risk, compared to the level 5 group (44% vs 13% respectively, p < 0.001). Conversely, there was a higher percentage of the level 5 group in the high-risk category compared to the level 1 group (31% vs 11% respectively, p < 0.001). The level 1 group had a better quality of diet in terms of higher consumption of fibre (p < 0.001), fruit and vegetables (p < 0.001), and plant protein (peas, beans and pulses; p = 0.001), compared to those in level 5. Nutritious food is essential for health, but these data suggest that the chances of accessing healthy food depend strongly on where we live. In Scotland, people living in communities associated with poverty, are less likely to have access to affordable, healthy food and are more likely to experience poor health as a result. Transforming our food system to be accessible, affordable, environmentally sustainable and culturally acceptable for all remains a high priority.Disclosures:This work was funded by Scottish Government as part of the Strategic Research Program at the Rowett Institute (2017–2021).

This scoping review aimed to systematically map the evidence on health, social, and educational impacts of childhood obesity. We conducted comprehensive database searches in April 2024, identifying 8,207 unique systematic reviews that included a childhood obesity exposure (0–18 years) and any health or social outcomes (up to 30 years), from UK or comparable high-income countries published between 1990–2024. Following screening and full-text review, 230 systematic reviews were included and categorised across four domains: physical health, mental health, social and behavioural, and educational and economic. Of the 230 reviews, 122 were narrative syntheses (53%), and 108 meta-analyses (47%). The outcomes domains studied were physical health (144/230, 63%), mental health (47/230, 20%), social and behavioural (21/230, 9%), educational and economic outcomes (10/230, 4%), with the remainder covering multiple domains (8/230, 4%). Each review was categorised as either finding an association between childhood obesity and the included outcome/s, ‘mixed’ if this differed across outcomes, or ‘null’ if there was no association. Most reviews found evidence of an association (86%), with fewer finding evidence of a mixed or null association (13% and 6%, respectively). Reviews assessing mental health outcomes had the highest percentage finding an association with childhood obesity (94%); reviews assessing educational outcomes found the lowest (70%). Of the associations, most found that obesity was associated with adverse outcomes. This mapping exercise highlighted significant evidence gaps. Non-health domains were less studied than physical and mental health. Limitations included not assessing the quality of studies or examining study overlap. This work can help identify reviews that provide parameters for cost-effectiveness modelling. It will also help guide further work to strengthen the evidence base between childhood obesity and health, social and education outcomes. This scoping review maps the multifaceted impact of childhood obesity across domains and provides an evidence foundation for prioritising outcomes in cost-effectiveness modelling of childhood weight management services. This work focuses on the impacts of obesity, rather than the narrative that obesity itself is a problem.Disclosures:This study was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) PRP-PRU-02-15-Healthy Weight.

Omobolanle Kazeem1*1Norfolk And Norwich University Hospitals Nhs Foundation Trust, Norwich, UKRecent decades have witnessed a tidal wave of adolescents with obesity, as well as obesity-related metabolic and cardiovascular diseases in tandem. Although the favourable effects of lifestyle measures, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery in the management of obesity have been well documented, a recurring problem in obesity treatment in adolescents, is the transition into adult care. This study explored the evidence of transition services for adolescents with obesity though a scoping review. According to Blum et al 1993: ‘’Transition is a multi-faceted, active process that attends to the medical, psychosocial, and educational and vocational needs of adolescents as they move from child-focused to the adult-focused health-care system.” There is a paucity of models or services for transitioning adolescents with obesity, despite the spotlight on the critical vulnerabilities of the transition period and the health outcomes. Poor health care transition from paediatric to adult health services jeopardises healthy weight management, with consequent unhealthy weights and associated co-morbidities. There is a paucity of evidence on the transition of adolescents with obesity in the literature, thus emphasising this as a priority research area or gap. Bridging this gap requires collaborative efforts to develop effective transition models. In this context, we therefore propose a model of transition known as the ACT of transition, A: Assessment of readiness, C: Consolidation of knowledge and skills, T: Transfer of care to ensure effective transitioning of adolescents with obesity.Disclosures:None Giang Nguyen1*, Jade Thorne1, Emilie Combet2, Dimitris Papamargaritis3, Alex Miras4, Sarah Le Brocq5, Stephanie Goodlet6, Lisa Davies6, Nicola Heslehurst11Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK,2School of Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK,3University of Leicester, Leicester, UK,4Ulster University, Belfast, UK,5All About Obesity, UK,6Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UKWeight stigma (WS) negatively impacts health outcomes. Hospital environments should be inclusive for people living with obesity (PLwO). This study aimed to develop a WS environment and equipment checklist with input from healthcare experts (HCPs), researchers, as well as people, carers, and family members with lived experience of obesity (C/FM) to increase obesity inclusivity in UK NHS hospital environments. A converging coding matrix was used to integrate multiple existing checklists, including one developed by Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, to form a draft version. A mixed-methods online survey (February-March 2025) was conducted and disseminated through professional and patient networks to gain feedback on the checklist categories (reading materials, furniture, equipment, and access and infrastructure). Sixty-nine respondents, including fifty-one HCPs, eight researchers, PLwO, and four C/FM. Most respondents thought that no items were missing, none should be removed, and no changes were needed to the wording of the checklist. Respondents expressed some concern about the language used, highlighting the need to avoid unintentionally stigmatising or non-inclusive language. Most identified checklist domains such as furniture, equipment, and access as challenging to implement without support. Financial constraints, especially within NHS budgets, were the primary barrier, with dedicated funding packages seen as essential. Additional challenges included limited space, outdated infrastructure, insufficient storage, and restricted access to suitable equipment via NHS suppliers. The need for increased awareness and understanding among NHS staff about the importance of creating inclusive environments for PLwO, the complexity of obesity, and what constitutes stigmatising practices was highlighted. Respondents also noted that training, education, and potential accreditation schemes could support implementation. Weight bias, both implicit and explicit, alongside discriminatory attitudes among healthcare professionals, was also seen as a significant barrier to progress. The collaboratively refined checklist offers a practical tool for NHS trusts to audit and enhance obesity-inclusive environments. Respondents valued the checklist but noted that implementation requires funding, structural changes, and staff training, while PLwO felt it may not improve their experience, citing the need for inclusive communication which not directly addressed by the checklist. This highlights the need for deeper exploration through qualitative methods.Disclosures:This research is funded by the Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust.

In this cross-sectional study, 32 individuals (75% female, aged 49 ± 11 years, mean body mass index 36 ± 7 kg/m2) with metabolically complicated overweight/obesity were assessed over two weeks. During this period, participants were instructed to consume five meals and snacks per day within a 14-h daily eating window (approximately 07:00–21:00 hrs). Habitual physical activity was measured via wrist-worn accelerometer, and 24-hour glycaemic control was assessed via blinded continuous glucose monitoring. Body composition was evaluated using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (index of skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity) and insulin-induced suppression of plasma free fatty acids (index of adipose tissue insulin sensitivity) were assessed via a two-stage hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp procedure. Linear regression analyses examined associations between activity timing, body composition, and cardiometabolic health parameters, adjusting for sex, age, and total activity. In the fully adjusted model, proportionally higher physical activity levels in the morning (06:00–11:59 hrs) was associated with greater lean body mass [β = 0.43 kg, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): (0.05, 0.8 kg), p = 0.03]. Proportionally higher physical activity levels in the afternoon activity (12:00–17:59 hrs) was associated with lower logarithmically-transformed fasting plasma triglycerides [β = −0.02 mg/dl, 95% CI: (−0.05, −0.0 mg/dl), p = 0.03] and borderline linked to fasting plasma glucose [β = 1.0 mg/dl, 95% CI: (−2.1, 0.06 mg/dl), p = 0.06]. Proportionally higher physical activity in the evening (18:00–23:59 hrs) showed a trend toward improved adipose tissue insulin sensitivity [β = 0.9%, 95% CI: (−0.2, 1.9%), p = 0.11]. No association was found between activity timing and 24-hour glycaemic control or skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity. These preliminary findings suggest that morning physical activity may be more beneficial for preserving lean body mass. Afternoon activity is associated with potential improvements in fasting plasma triglyceride and glucose levels. A trend between evening activity and improvements in adipose tissue insulin sensitivity was observed. Larger studies examining not only the timing but also the type and intensity of physical activity are needed to expand upon our findings.Disclosures:Funded by NIH, AHA, and Evelyn Trust.

Fakenham Weight management Service, a specialist multi-disciplinary service based in primary care attempted the challenge of collecting weight data both during and at 12 months post completion of the programme. This evaluation analysed five years of data from 1/4/2014 to 28/3/2019 including data from 1094 patients. The one-year programme was based on National Institute of Health and Care excellence guidelines CG189 and met the criteria for a multi-disciplinary specialist weight management service. Outcomes included weight and BMI changes at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and 12 months after discharge. Quality of life, physical activity, and quality of diet were measured quarterly. Blood pressure and HBA1c in people with type 2 diabetes were measured at the onset and end of the programme. Data on weight a year after discharge was collected directly from participants in person, or by post, from GP records, and from attenders at support groups. Clinically and statistically significant improvements in weight, diet, physical activity, quality of life, blood pressure and blood glucose control were observed at the completion of the programme. Weight loss in completers was a mean of 6.2% (SD 5.8), with 60%, losing ≥5% of their baseline weight, and 23.8% losing ≥10% of their baseline weight. Long-term weight data 12 months post-discharge in completers showed a mean weight loss of 8.3% (SD 10.3) n = 350 from baseline weight using all available data. Using baseline observation carried forward for the whole cohort there was a mean weight loss of 2.5% (SD 6.8) n = 1094 a year post-discharge. The results confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of providing a specialist weight management service in primary care. However long- term follow-up data was incomplete, required a variety of methods, and was unfunded. These results pre-date the introduction of GLP1 receptor agonist anti-obesity medications and new evidence on the effectiveness of total diet replacements and including these treatment options should improve weight loss. Commissioners should consider requiring and funding long- term follow up when designing service specifications.Disclosures:CH time was funded by the Rona Marsden Research fund at Fakenham Medical Practice.

Kimberley Norman1,2*, Monica Garner2,31Monash University, Melbourne, Australia,2The Obesity Collective, Australia,3True Yoga, Sydney, AustraliaDue to the complex and individualised nature of obesity, multi-disciplinary healthcare teams are considered best practice for delivering effective care. However, current health system strains—resource, time, and funding—limit this approach, prompting exploration of alternative strategies. Yoga teachers may offer unique value in obesity care, given their physiological knowledge and ability to deliver holistic, low-impact, and accessible healthcare. To explore yoga teachers’ perspectives on the suitability of integrating yoga into primary care multi-disciplinary teams.Method:Fifteen yoga teachers with experience delivering obesity-related yoga care participated in semi-structured interviews. This co-designed qualitative study involved obesity lived experience experts, yoga teachers, and obesity primary care researchers. Interviews were analysed using Braun and Clarke’s thematic analysis. Three overarching themes were identified: 1) misunderstanding of what constitutes authentic yoga, 2) alignment between yoga practices and the complex health needs associated with obesity, and 3) the need for professional validation of yoga teachers. Participants expressed frustration with the dominant social media portrayal of yoga as only advanced postures, typically exclusive for young, thin, white individuals. In contrast, authentic yoga was described as a cross-cultural, holistic, and low-impact health practice with wide accessibility. Teachers emphasised a commitment to the principle of ‘do no harm’ likening it to the ethical standards found in the Hippocratic Oath of Western medicine. Importantly, participants rarely discussed weight change when addressing the benefits of yoga for individuals living with obesity. All participants stressed the importance of an accreditation system to demarcate authentic yoga and ensure safe healthcare. Yoga teachers demonstrate a significant foundation in physiological principles, a client-centred care approach, and a nuanced understanding of the complex obesity health issue. Participants strongly endorsed the integration of yoga and yoga teachers into multi-disciplinary care teams for people living with obesity. Current referral pathways to allied health professionals (e.g., Pilates instructors) are already associated with positive health outcomes and patient acceptability, suggesting a viable precedent for similar pathways involving yoga teachers. Further research is warranted to explore and evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of developing a recognised accreditation process for yoga teachers within Western healthcare systems.Disclosures:Funding for Dr Norman was through Monash University as part of regular employment as research fellow.

Claire Torrens1*, Gozde Ozakinci1, Barbara Farquharson11University Of Stirling, Stirling, UKRetaining people for the duration of weight management programmes and in studies of obesity interventions is a challenge. Poor retention has financial costs as well as costs in terms of data quality, validity and knowledge translation. A number of behavioural strategies have been identified which have the potential to improve retention at follow-up in trials. However, research in this area has been limited, the evidence is uncertain and has not focused on style of delivery, including relationships. With the aim of exploring strategies to improve retention, two protocolised follow-up weight assessments were implemented as part of a study within a trial, scheduled at 3- and 6 months, during the 12-month text-based behavioural weight management programme. Participants were randomised to receive either a task-oriented or relational approach delivered by researchers at each of the three centres (Belfast, Bristol and Glasgow). The task-oriented approach focused on completing a weight verification and recording relevant information on the case report form. The relational approach focused on building the relationship with the participant in addition to completing these tasks. This qualitative study sought to explore participant and researchers’ experiences of the follow-up weight assessments using framework method and was carried out prior to the quantitative data analysis. Fifty-four trial participants took part in interviews alongside five researchers, who delivered the protocols. Three broad themes were constructed from the narratives: the experience of attending follow-up weight assessments, the mode of weight assessment delivery and the style of weight assessment delivery. Nine related sub-themes provided an insight into the emotive nature of weight assessments related to weight stigma and the impact of attendance for participants. They also provided evidence for the need for human contact within digital interventions and how the role of researchers and relationship have importance for retention but also other weight-related outcomes. Researcher-participant relationships have an important role in retention. The approach of researchers within trial processes such as outcome assessments could improve attendance within weight management trials primarily by providing accountability and support. Removal of relationships by digital-only interventions or during participant follow-up has potential implications for retention and wider intervention implementation.Disclosures:This qualitative study forms part of a SWAT designed within a NIHR funded trial 129703.

Hans Johnson1,2, Nadja Auerbach1, Ashley Clift1,3*, David Huang11Menwell Ltd, London, UK,2University of Bristol, Bristol, UK,3Imperial College London, London, UKNovel pharmacotherapies such as GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have emerged as transformative medications for weight management. However, prescriptions and uptake in the UK NHS remain low compared to the prevalence of obesity in the population. Understanding healthcare professionals’ (HCPs) perspectives on GLP-1RAs could inform strategies to promote fair, effective use at scale. We undertook a mixed-methods study comprising: 1) an online survey assessing knowledge, prescribing practices and attitudes towards GLP-1RAs, and 2) qualitative interviews to identify emerging themes. Quantitative data were analysed with descriptive statistics. Braun & Clarke’s framework was applied for thematic interview analysis. 72 HCPs completed the online survey: 58.3% were female, 62.5% worked in NHS settings, and 52.8% were GPs (8.3% prescribing pharmacists, 6.9% advanced nursing practitioners). Whilst 51.4% reported high or very high familiarity with therapeutic uses of GLP-1 RAs, only 40.3% stated that they had confidence in prescribing them (29.2% reported low or very low confidence). There were mixed opinions on the appropriateness of GLP-1RAs as a first-line approach for weight management (44.4% disagreed/strongly disagreed), but 57.0% agreed/strongly agreed that GLP-1RAs are under-utilised. 8 HCPs partook in qualitative interviews: major themes comprised: ‘efficacy’, ‘concerns regarding sustainability and long-term effects’, ‘systemic barriers and access inequities’, ‘professional knowledge gaps’, ‘service delivery models’, ‘digital and private healthcare landscape’, and ‘silver bullet misconceptions’. Individual interviewees’ concerns included: NHS resource constraints, adequacy of HCP knowledge, risks of sarcopenic obesity, restrictive eligibility criteria and private-public healthcare friction. Positive perspectives included optimism around the scope for reduction of weight-related stigma and shame with digital services, and roles for innovative patient-support models. HCPs recognise the significant potential of GLP-1RAs for weight management and most believe they are under-used. Despite this, they articulated major barriers to their effective implementation including lack of prescribing confidence, lack of resource for appropriate multidisciplinary care, and divergence of opinion on when best to utilise them. The perspectives elucidated suggest that enhanced training and the development of efficient, collaborative care pathways could empower HCPs in providing broader, appropriate, equitable use of these medications.Disclosures:HJ, NA, AKC and DRH are employees of Menwell Ltd, which provides digital weight management service (“Voy”). Shokraneh Moghadam1*, Mark Tarrant2, Lily Hawkins1, Dawn Swancutt2, Laura Hollands2, Rod Sheaff2, Jonathan Pinkney2, Jenny Lloyd11University of Exeter, Exeter, UK,2University of Plymouth, Plymouth, UKGroups are increasingly used in obesity treatment and may provide a time-and cost-effective method of care. Beyond their practical benefits, group-based programmes potentially offer valuable opportunities for social support, which may enhance patient engagement and improve clinical outcomes. However, little is known about how group support impacts adults living with severe obesity, particularly within specialist weight management settings in the UK. This study explores patients’ views and experiences of group support as part of the PROGROUP trial, which aims to test whether a group-based programme (PROGROUP) helps people with severe obesity manage their weight more effectively than the usual care provided by the National Health Service. Twelve patients from a specialist weight management service in Northern England, randomised to either PROGROUP or usual care, took part in follow up semi-structured interviews about their perceptions and experiences of PROGROUP and the specialist weight management service. Thematic analysis was carried out and guided by the Framework Approach for data management. Findings revealed three themes which were common to both patient groups: shared support from similar others, desire for a safe space, and sharing strategies. Regardless of whether patients were in the PROGROUP intervention or receiving usual care, many valued the experience, or the opportunity, to receive support from others with similar weight management experiences. These patients recognised the benefits of group support, describing it as a potentially safe space to share personal experiences of managing their weight, exchange practical tips (such as recipes and physical activity ideas), and discuss weight management strategies with supportive peers. In PROGROUP specifically, these effects emerged to the extent that members formed a shared social identity. While others expressed a preference for more personalised care, group support was still considered a valuable element of treatment. The findings suggest that group-based programmes for weight management may offer a supportive and empowering environment for people living with obesity. While personalised care remains important, group support has the potential to offer both informational and emotional benefits by providing a platform to discuss behaviour change strategies with others who share lived experiences of obesity and weight management.Disclosures:This project is funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) [PROGROUP (NIHR201038)] and in conjunction with the Applied Research Collaboration South West Peninsula [PenARC (NIHR200167)].

It is a multisystem, progressive condition characterised by vision (retinal dystrophy) and hearing loss, obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiomyopathy and renal dysfunction requiring specialist multidisciplinary management. Treatment of obesity in ALMS is difficult, with limited efficacy of glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) receptor agonists and inconclusive results for the MC4R agonist, Setmelanotide. We present a case of an adolescent living with ALMS who has shown a successful response to Tirzepatide, a dual agonist for GLP-1 and Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide (GIP) receptors. This male patient was born at term weighing 4.4 kg and developed early-onset, hyperphagic obesity. He was diagnosed with retinal dystrophy aged one year and moved to the UK aged 9 years, whilst being referred to a weight management service at 11 years. At that time his weight was 86.6 kg, height 162.5 cm, BMI 32.9 kg/m2(BMI-SDS +3.32). He was hypertensive, with evidence of metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), and significant visual impairment due to retinal dystrophy and was diagnosed with ALMS at 12 years of age. Despite behavioural and dietetic input from the multi-professional weight management team, he continued to gain weight. He initially commenced daily GLP-1 agonist therapy (Liraglutide) at 14 years of age but experienced further weight gain. Nine months later he was switched to Semaglutide, a weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist, for seven months, but weight gain persisted with no reported appetite change. Aged 17 years he was commenced on Tirzepatide (GLP-1 and GIP dual agonist) off-licence due to his obesity associated complications, with weight 122.7 kg, BMI 37.2 kg/m2(BMI SDS +3.77). Following, 3 months of treatment (5 mg weekly), he has lost 9.7 kg (7.9% weight loss, BMI-SDS reduction 0.25), the medication is well tolerated with the patient reporting considerable reduction in appetite. With negligible reported benefits from Semaglutide and Setmelanotide in Alstrom’s syndrome, these early weight and appetite changes suggest possible benefits from dual agonist treatment which warrants further investigation in this condition.Disclosures:None Keiko Kanno1*1University of Oxford, Oxford, UK,2Green Templeton College, Oxford, UKThis research examines the relationship between sociodemographic factors, daily dietary behaviours, and obesity in contemporary Mongolia. It explores how dietary habits influence body weight across rural, urban, and peri-urban areas using a mixed-methods approach, combining both structured and semi-structured interviews with qualitative and quantitative data analysis. The study compares obesity rates and dietary patterns among rural nomads, urban settlers, and peri-urban residents, many of whom are internal migrants from rural areas. It also considers additional sociodemographic factors, such as food environments and occupations, while investigating generational differences in obesity and dietary behaviours. The findings reveal that internal migrants in Ulaanbaatar are nearly twice as likely to be overweight or obesity compared to non-migrants. Regional variations in dietary behaviours were also evident, particularly in relation to seasonal food consumption, meal frequency, and cooking practices. Furthermore, dietary behaviours such as food commensality and meal frequency appeared to be more strongly shaped by regional factors than by generational differences, suggesting that lifestyle, work environments, and food availability have a more substantial influence on eating habits than age. The study underscores the complex interplay between sociodemographic characteristics and dietary practices, highlighting that factors such as migration, regional food environments, and work conditions are pivotal in understanding obesity in modern Mongolia. These findings offer valuable insights for policy-makers and public health initiatives aiming to address obesity in diverse settings.Disclosures:This research was funded by grants from Green Templeton College, the School of Anthropology at the University of Oxford, the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the Philip Bagby Trust, and the American Anthropological Association.

Skeletal muscle, a key regulator of whole-body glucose homeostasis, is particularly vulnerable to metabolic and inflammatory insults, making it a critical target for mechanistic studies. In this case study, we used a rodent model combining a high-fat diet (HFD) with angiotensin II (AngII) infusion to mimic obesity-related metabolic and cardiovascular stress, and assessed its effects on skeletal muscle insulin signalling and inflammatory markers. Phosphorylation of Akt, a central mediator of insulin sensitivity, was reduced in HFD+AngII-treated rats compared to controls, thereby suggesting impaired metabolic signalling in this model. To explore inflammatory responses, we investigated the expression of high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), an alarmin increasingly implicated in obesity-related tissue damage and chronic inflammation. Immunoblotting analysis, although limited by sample size (n = 2 per group), revealed elevated HMGB1 protein levels in skeletal muscle from HFD+AngII-treated rats. To investigate the relationship between metabolic and inflammatory markers, we performed Pearson’s correlation analysis between HMGB1 expression and the pAkt:tAkt ratio, using technical replicates (n = 3 per biological replicate). A moderate-to-strong negative correlation was observed (r = −0.5855, r2= 0.3428; p = 0.046), suggesting that increased HMGB1 levels are inversely associated with insulin signalling activity in skeletal muscle under multimorbid conditions. No immunohistochemical changes were observed in HMGB1 localisation. These preliminary findings illustrate the value of multifactorial rodent models in capturing the interplay between metabolic and inflammatory stressors. Moreover, they suggest that targeting HMGB1 or its downstream signalling could offer a potential new avenue for investigating strategies to preserve muscle insulin sensitivity in the context of obesity-linked multimorbidity. Further validation in larger cohorts will be essential to determine whether this relationship holds in more advanced disease stages, particularly those associated with ageing, or in other metabolically active tissues.Disclosures:MW is funded as a PhD student through the University of Strathclyde Faculty of Science Global Research Scholarship Programme (awarded 2023) Reference number 229057368.

Time Restricted Eating (TRE) is a type of intermittent fasting that limits the time between the first and last period of eating, as a form of caloric restriction. Ten-hour TRE is a common regime, with an eating window to support long-term dietary adherence, expressed as 14:10, with 14 hours fasting. This study reports on a randomised crossover trial utilising TRE and meal frequency in UK adults living with overweight and obesity. The study explored the efficacy and physiological appetite response to a controlled TRE regime in a human intervention study focused on change in body weight and fat mass, using bio-impedance (BIA) assessment. All subjects gave written, informed consent. The 3-week randomised study included 10 adults (9 females and 1 male), aged 36–62 years, with a mean BMI of 33.1 kg/m2. The subjects received a high protein (HP) intervention weight loss diet (WL, 30:35:35% of energy from protein, fat and carbohydrate, respectively); provided as either 2 meals/day or 5 meals/day, which was consumed during the 10-hour TRE window (from 07:00 to 17:00). All meals were individually prepared to meet 100% resting energy requirements (RMR). A T-test confirmed both diets were associated with a significant reduction in body weight (p < 0.001 for both diets) and body fat mass (p = 0.037 for 2 meals/day and p = 0.006 for 5 meals/day) from baseline, with no significant difference between the two diets. On average, consuming 2 meals/day led to a weight loss of −1.26 kg (SD 0.334), and 5 meals/day −1.08 kg (SD 0.443). There was an associated body fat mass loss of −0.68 kg (SD 0.876) with 2 meals/day and −1.07 kg (SD 0.946) with 5 meals/day. The subjective appetite data is still to be analysed, but these preliminary data support the hypothesis that 10-hour TRE window, consumed as either 2 or 5 meals/day, can support short-term weight loss.Disclosures:This work was funded by the Saudi Arabian government (The Saudi Arabian Cultural Bureau in the UK). Rukhsar Nadeem1*, Raghavendar Palani1, Jonathan Hazlehurst11University Hospitals Birmingham, Birmingham, UKObesity is a complex, chronic condition requiring multimodal management. The Joint Position Statement on Medical Therapies for Obesity (Phase 1) outlines eligibility criteria for pharmacological intervention. This study evaluates real-world eligibility for bariatric surgery and tirzepatide in a cohort of people with obesity, incorporating demographic and lifestyle factors. A retrospective analysis was conducted in individuals attending Birmingham Heartlands Hospital from October 2024 to April 2025. Data collected included demographics, baseline BMI, weight, smoking status, alcohol use, employment status, and eligibility for bariatric surgery and tirzepatide. Eligibility for tirzepatide was assessed based on BMI thresholds and comorbidities as per Phase 1 guidance. Descriptive statistics and subgroup analyses were performed to identify disparities in eligibility. Cohort Characteristics: 108 individuals (median age 41.5 years [IQR: 29–54]; 64.18 % female). Median baseline BMI was 47.21 kg/m2(IQR: 38.0–53.0), with a median weight of 124 kg (IQR: 106.00–151.90). Eligibility for tirzepatide: 35.19% were prescribed tirzepatide for glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes, 30.55% were prescribed it for severe obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), 5.56% were eligible due to infertility, 6.48% were eligible due to genetic conditions. Lifestyle & Socioeconomic Patterns: 69.44% of individuals were unemployed, 15.74% reported alcohol consumption, 8.33% reported smoking. Comorbidities: Hypertension: 23.15%, Type 2 diabetes: 52.78%, Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): 12.96%, Hypothyroidism: 9.26%. A significant proportion of individuals met eligibility criteria for medical therapy and/or surgery, though lifestyle and socioeconomic factors influenced access. Most individuals were unemployed, and severe OSA was the most common eligibility criterion for weight management alone. Additionally, a large proportion of people with obesity also had type 2 diabetes, and tirzepatide provided dual benefits for both obesity and glycaemic control. Since October 2024, tirzepatide has been prescribed in line with Phase 1 guidance, and this study serves as an audit of its implementation in clinical practice.Disclosures:None Anjali Zalin1*, Maria Mouyis1, Thushari Balasooriya1, George Duffield1, Emma Patten1, Saima Ali1, Sanhita Chakrabarti21Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK,2Bedfordshire Luton and Milton Keynes (BLMK) Integrated Care Board ICBObesity has become one of the most commonly occurring risk factors in obstetric practice. Pregnant women with obesity are at greater risk of pregnancy-related complications compared with women of normal BMI, including hypertension, pre-eclampsia, thrombosis and gestational diabetes mellitus. There are significant inequalities in women who are most at risk of having obesity during pregnancy, including living in areas of high deprivation and women from Black ethnic groups. Women also report experiences of obesity stigma during pregnancy. The preconception stage offers an opportunity for metabolic optimisation and a deeper understanding of women at higher risk.Objective:Given the recognised local impact of obesity in pregnancy, we designed a novel joint pathway incorporating obesity and maternal medicine expertise. The aims include: 1) Improve metabolic status of women aiming to conceive by laying the foundation for improved maternal and fetal outcomes 2) Reduce risk through a range of personalised, evidence-based measures 3) Promote awareness of obesity as a risk factor in maternal and fetal medicine 4) Work with a range of stakeholders including women living with obesity to integrate obesity care and share system learning and resource 5) Use data and improvement methodology to support learning and effective, sustainable care. The pilot has considered the evidence base, expert opinion as well as local context and challenges to present a proposal for implementation. This will be carefully evaluated and further refined using feedback from colleagues and service users. A joint clinic has been established with maternal and multidisciplinary obesity expertise. A database has been developed to capture a joint maternal medicine/obesity consult. Following review, women are then able to fast-track access to evidence-based treatments including medical, dietary and psychological interventions. A detailed metabolic profile will be developed to further understanding. Digital therapeutics will be incorporated. The pilot has commenced and received positive feedback from patients and staff. A novel consult which minimises duplication has been established. Combining preconception counselling with metabolic profiling and obesity assessment is feasible to conduct in the real-world setting. The approach minimises duplication and offers a preventative strategy to improve maternal and fetal outcomes in women living with obesity.Disclosures:Dr Zalin has accepted funds from NovoNordisk and Lilly for training and conference attendance.

This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of behavioural interventions at reducing the risk of T2DM, with a focus on long-term outcomes in high-income countries. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PsychINFO, ERIC and Web of Science for publications including protocols, theses and abstracts, and clinical trial registration databases from inception until 20/02/2024. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were individual, or cluster randomised controlled trials conducted in high-income countries, with a postpartum intervention that included dietary or physical activity changes, a control group that received minimal, standard or no care, and reported follow-up from randomisation of at least one year. Studies were excluded where pharmacotherapy was used, or if they were not available in English. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024518659). Searches identified 2900 studies. 117 full texts were screened, and nine studies were included for analysis (n = 2001 women with previous GDM). Women in the included studies had a mean (SD) age of 35.80 (5.41) and BMI of 28.17 (6.05). Five studies reported on weight, and three reported on fasting plasma glucose (FPG), at 12-months. Random effects meta-analyses showed women in the intervention group lost more weight (−1.21 kgs, 95% CI [−3.14–0.72]), and had a greater decrease in FPG (−0.27 mmol/l, 95% CI [−0.66– 0.11]) compared to the control group. However, these results must be interpreted with caution, as heterogeneity among the studies was substantial. Offering women with a history of GDM postpartum lifestyle interventions helps reduce weight and lowers FPG; indicating such interventions may help lower risk of future T2DM in this group.Disclosures:This study is part of a PhD studentship funded by Diabetes UK.

This study aimed to identify behavioural and broader determinants of childhood obesity through a review using a novel AI-assisted methodology. A literature search was conducted in Medline, PsycINFO, and PubMed to identify reviews published between 1 January 2007 and 24 April 2025 that (1) involved children or adolescents aged 0–18 years, and (2) investigated determinants of obesity (e.g. screen time, physical activity). A total of 362 systematic review articles were included. Traditional systematic review methods were combined with large language models to expedite eligibility screening, full-text data extraction, and thematic synthesis. The review identified a wide range of determinants. Behavioural determinants included unhealthy dietary patterns, low levels of physical activity, excessive screen time, and insufficient sleep. These behaviours were often shaped by social and environmental determinants including family routines, parental influence, peer norms, school policies, and broader structural factors such as socioeconomic status, food marketing, and neighbourhood environments. Environmental constraints, such as limited access to green spaces and affordable healthy food, were especially influential in low-income contexts. AI-assisted methods enabled rapid and structured extraction of complex data across a large, heterogeneous body of literature, improving both the speed and consistency of synthesis while maintaining rigour through human oversight. AI tools supported the identification of recurring themes, classification of determinants, and cross-context comparisons. This project demonstrates the potential of AI to enhance the efficiency of evidence synthesis in addressing complex public health challenges. The findings underscore the complex, multi-layered nature of obesity determinants and support the need for multi-factorial interventions across behavioural, social and structural levels.Disclosures:This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council under grant (ES/Y001044/1).

Standard care: The standard care group will receive no additional structured support. At baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months, we will measure weight (using “e-scales” that send data automatically when participants step on the scales), average blood glucose (using at-home fingerpick tests) and other physical and mental health outcomes and health economics outcomes like health resource use (using self-report questionnaires). Our analyses will evaluate whether SWiM is better than standard care at reducing weight regain, average blood glucose (HbA1c), and health care costs, and improving other physical and mental health outcomes over two years. We will assess whether SWiM works equally well in different groups. In an embedded process evaluation, we will also interview a subset of participants and people involved in delivering SWiM to understand what worked, what didn’t, and why. We will use health economic modelling to examine the long term physical and mental health impact and cost-effectiveness of SWiM. Our findings will inform decisions on whether and how SWiM should be commissioned to support weight loss maintenance in people who have taken part in behavioural programmes for obesity and type 2 diabetes.Disclosures:NIHR Programme Grants for Applied Research (NIHR206801) has funded this work.

The service aims to help participants achieve appropriate weight gain during pregnancy, in line with British Dietetic Association (BDA) guidelines, and to support weight loss in the postnatal period. Antenatal and postnatal weights were either self-reported by clients or taken during face-to-face sessions as part of the three antenatal appointments offered by the service. Based on BDA guidelines, recommended weight gain for individuals with a BMI > 30 kg/m2was defined as 5–9 kg during pregnancy. Postnatal weights were collected during face-to-face sessions or through self-reporting. Qualitative data were gathered via a client feedback survey to evaluate participants’ experiences and the impact of the programme on their physical and mental health. Of the 275 referrals received since March 2023, 63 clients completed antenatal weight tracking, and 37 provided postnatal weight tracking. Among antenatal participants, 50 (79%) maintained weight gain within the 5–9 kg BDA-recommended range. Eight clients lost weight during pregnancy, with weight changes attributed to healthy lifestyle modifications. The average weight change during pregnancy was +5.6 kg, ranging from −7 kg to +24 kg. Postnatally, 21 out of 37 clients (57%) achieved a weight below their referral weight, and 32 clients (86%) lost weight from their final recorded pregnancy weight. Qualitative feedback highlighted the programme’s positive impact on participants’ experiences. One participant shared, “I have enjoyed every session, and the way everything gets explained really helps with not only me but my family as well, for example my husband and stepdaughter.” Participants frequently praised the service’s non-judgmental approach and the opportunity to learn sustainable strategies for weight management, which also positively influenced their mental health. The service achieved strong outcomes in promoting healthy weight gain during pregnancy and weight loss postnatally. While 79% of antenatal participants met recommended weight gain targets, postnatal results demonstrated sustained benefits, with 86% losing weight from their final pregnancy weight. Qualitative feedback underscored the programme’s value in improving participants’ physical and mental well-being.Disclosures:This project was funded by The Innovation Fund grant.

The current study evaluated implementation fidelity of a pilot digital tier 3 child weight management service in the southeast of England. A pragmatic sample of 14 individual interviews & 4 focus groups were conducted. This resulted in a total of 36 (15 male) individuals comprising service staff across senior management (n = 1), team lead (n = 1) & practitioner (n = 4) roles, as well as service clients comprising of children & young people (n = 19) & significant others (n = 11). Questions addressed knowledge, attitudes & beliefs towards health behaviour change, as well as views on barriers & opportunities for pilot participation. All data were transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was then conducted with outcomes represented as pen profiles which presents findings from content analysis via a diagram of composite key emerging themes. Positive views of the service were highlighted by children, young people & significant others across the key themes of: Programme staff & structure; family engagement & support; lifestyle changes; health & weight outcomes; & emotional & psychosocial wellbeing. With regards to service staff, mixed degrees of implementation fidelity were noted across the key themes of: Family engagement & support; staff meetings & training; programme structure; & client outcomes. Lessons learned showed that the program’s structure & supportive approach resulted in high retention rates & consistent session attendance. This indicated strong client commitment & satisfaction. Furthermore, significant weight loss, improved physical health, & enhanced emotional wellbeing were noted highlighting service effectiveness. Overall, clients were making healthier lifestyle choices, which was reflected in both physical health improvements & positive behavioural changes. This process evaluation represents one of the first efforts to document implementation fidelity of an ongoing tier 3 child weight management service. In the context of child weight management services, the ubiquity of digital technologies & their adoption into day-to-day life translates into greater potential reach than traditional health behaviour change interventions, & consequently, greater potential for positive public health impact.Disclosures:None AB Sirin Ayva1*, Emma Nicholls1, Grace Shiplee1, James Roast1, Sophie Edwards1, Paul Gately11Morelife Uk, Leeds Beckett University, Headingley CampusMoreLife UK delivers tailor-made, evidence-based and psychologically informed health improvement programmes to individuals and families. Morelife created a unique weight management programme for children and young people based on Adventure Therapy and storytelling approaches. The programme aims to help children living with obesity to pursue a healthy lifestyle while managing their weight. The programme is aimed at children living with obesity and their families. It has 10 weekly sessions to cover obesity-related topics, such as nutrition, physical activity, sleep, and stress via adventure therapy activities. Morelife created a Healthy Behaviours Questionnaire to monitor nutrition, screen time and sleep and stress. The questionnaire has 3 subscales (Nutrition: 12 questions, Screen Time: 3 questions, Sleep: 6 questions) 21 questions in total with visual aids to make it more engaging for children and young people. We implemented this questionnaire to monitor healthy behaviours before and after the programme. Thirty-seven children and 30 parents completed the pre and post Healthy Behaviour Questionnaire. Some of the results are shared below: The number of children who have stated that they do not like eating new fruits and vegetables has significantly decreased from 6 in the pre-programme questionnaire to 1 in the post-programme questionnaire. The percentage of children who are eating three or more portions of fruit and vegetables per day has increased from less than a third (32%) to more than half (51%). The percentage of parents who think their children know what a balanced diet is has increased from less than 50% to over 80% after completing the programme. 87% of the parents think that their children have become more aware of what a balanced diet looks like since starting the programme. The most common changes made at home to help them eat a balanced diet were more fruits and vegetables, reduced sugar and smaller portions. The number of children who are waking up full of energy has increased from 14% to 22%. Morelife PA club is effective on improving nutrition, physical activity and sleep.

Morelife piloted a Binge Eating Intervention that started in September 2021 and until late 2023. The aim of this pilot was to provide a binge eating intervention before starting the main weight management intervention to ascertain whether this improves client outcomes on their disordered binge eating. The Binge Eating intervention is a 12-week, guided self-help programme that is compliant with NICE guidelines. It consists of individuals working through a manual alongside seven telephone support sessions from their trained guide. Once clients complete the Binge Eating Intervention, they then enter More Life’s standard one-year weight management intervention. The Binge Eating Scale (BES) was used to screen clients for this pilot. The (BES) is a 16-item self-report instrument designed to evaluate the presence and behavioural manifestations of binge-eating disorder (BED), with scores ranging between 0 to 46. Those clients who scored 27 or above were offered the binge eating intervention prior to starting our standard weight management intervention. The clients who completed this 12-week Self-Guided Binge Eating pilot repeated the BES to compare their results after completing the programme. Between September 2022 and December 2023, 44 clients completed the Guided Self-Help program. The average BED score was 34.25 before the programme whereas it reduced to 22.9 at the end of 12-week programme. Following completion of the Guided Self-Help Programme, the clients attended More Life’s standard one-year weight management programme. Thirty-eight clients completed the 12-week healthy lifestyle programme with average weight loss of 3.18 kg (2.51% reduction from their initial weight). At the 6-month point, the average weight loss was 8.41 kg (n = 28, 6.40% reduction from their initial weight), whereas, at 12 months, the average weight loss was 11.29 kg (n = 15, 8.19% reduction from their initial weight). Self-guided binge Eating programmes are effective in reducing binge eating scores for people living with obesity. The weight loss followed steadily but significantly after the completion of the programme.Disclosures:None AB Sirin Ayva1*, Andrew Taylor1, James Roast1, Sophie Edwards1, Paul Gately11Morelife Uk, Leeds Beckett University, Headingley CampusMore Life is a healthy lifestyle provider across the UK. Physical activity referral scheme (PARS) is granted by MoreLife to provide assessments of children and young people (CYP) and their families with the aim of increasing their uptake of community-based physical activity, and, to reduce sedentary behaviours. This programme has been running since June 2021, allowing health and social care professionals to refer children into the service if they meet the eligibility criteria of ages between 5 and 17 and 91st Centile and above (prioritising 96th centile and above). Junior PARS is a 10-week social prescribing programme that connects children and young people aged 5–17 to fun sports and activities in their local neighbourhood. In this programme, Morelife also provides simple tips and advice on how to eat healthy and improve a healthy lifestyle. More Life accepts referrals from health professionals or clients and their families. The programme offers an initial assessment, week 1 and 5 reviews, and an end assessment. The WHO-5 is a self-report instrument measuring mental well-being Morelife had 210 referrals between October 2023 and July 2024 and 179 actively engaged clients. At the start of the 10 weeks, the average amount of physical activity the client engaged in was 2.7 days per week; after the 10 weeks, physical activity increased to an average of 3.9 days per week. 77 % achieved their goal of increasing physical activity. At the start of the 10-week program, the average well-being score (WHO-5) was 69. After 10 weeks, the average well-being score increased to 77, reflecting the positive impacts of attending the program. Selected parent feedback regarding the programme: “When she started basketball she was really struggling but is now more confident”, “He is more social and interactive with others”, “He has made positive changes to his BMI, he can run faster and has more stamina”. The PARS programme has been shown to be an effective way of increasing physical activity and well-being in children and young people. However, long-term evaluations are needed to determine the programme’s long-term effectiveness on physical activity and weight.Disclosures:None Zhao’an Cheng1*, Nelson Wee2, Simin Thio3, Xin Rong Ng3, Jing Sheng Quek3, Sabrina Wong Kay Wye3, Theresia Handayani Mina11LKC Medicine, Nanyang Technological University Singapore, Singapore,2Healthway Medical Group,3National Health Group PolyclinicsIntroduction:The prevalence of overweight and obesity is rising globally, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. While various weight management strategies—such as meal replacements and exercise programs—have been widely explored in Western countries, their effectiveness in Asian populations remains less understood.Methods:To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining behavioural interventions for weight loss in Asian adults (≥18 years) with overweight or obesity. Following PRISMA guidelines, we screened 25,937 unique studies, identifying 65 that met the inclusion criteria for final analysis. Key extracted data included changes in weight, BMI, and body fat percentage, alongside intervention characteristics such as personnel involvement, intervention intensity, and the use of technology. Interventions were mapped to their respective Behaviour Change Technique (BCT) domains.Results and conclusion:Preliminary findings highlighted three commonly used BCT domains: shaping knowledge (91%), goal setting and planning (86%) and feedback and monitoring (83%). Long-term interventions (>6 months) were more effective in achieving weight loss (−1.45 kg; 95% CI: −3.16 to 0.26 kg) than short-term interventions (<6 months) (−1.15 kg; 95% CI: −0.03 to 2.32 kg), though neither approach achieved clinically significant weight loss, defined as weight loss > 5% of body weight. Over 50% of studies incorporated digital tools, such as web portals and mobile applications, with 17 studies conducted entirely remotely. Two-thirds of these studies were published in the last five years, reflecting growing interest in digital health solutions. Most studies (82%) targeted both diet and physical activity. Additionally, >50% of the interventions followed a one-on-one delivery style, indicating a possible preference for personalized counselling over group-based programs. Unravelling behavioural domains which confer greatest influence on weight loss is crucial for optimizing behavioural weight management strategies in the region and providing valuable insight for healthcare providers.Disclosures:Funding information NIL.

This study aims to determine the prevalence of dynapenia, sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity among postmenopausal women and identify associated risk factors for dynapenioa/sarcopenia. This is an ongoing study in which 800 out of proposed 1100 postmenopausal women <60 years have been enrolled. Women who had any neuromuscular disorder, acute or chronic infection, malignancy and organ dysfunction were excluded. Hand grip strength (HGS) <18 kg assessed by hand held dynamometer, classified as dynapenia. Socioeconomic, clinical, anthropometric, biochemical, nutritional, physical activity parameters were noted along with DEXA scan was performed in dynapenic women and an equal number of non-dynapenic women. Dynapenic women with an appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI) <5.4 kg were classified as sarcopenic. Statistical comparisons were made between dynapenic/sarcopenic (S) and non-sarcopenic (NS) women. The prevalence of dynapenia and sarcopenia were 7.7% (62) and 5.1% (41) respectively. The prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥ 25 Kg/m2) and sarcopenic obesity were 65.5% (524) and 2.75% (22) respectively among postmenopausal women. Both groups showed no significant difference in age and comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia and thyroid disorders. Dynapenia/sarcopenia was significantly associated with rural residence (p < 0.05) and lower waist and hip circumference (p < 0.05), although difference in BMI was not significant (p = 0.08). DEXA measurements revealed significantly lower lean body mass and bone mineral density (BMD) in the S group (p < 0.05). There was significantly low progesterone level in the S group while no significant differences in estradiol, testosterone and DHEA. There were no differences in lipid profile parameters, hemoglobin, calcium, vitamin D and physical activity levels among both groups while significantly lower mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (p < 0.05) and urea levels (p < 0.05) were observed in the S group. Nutritional assessment revealed significantly lower energy, protein, carbohydrate, fat, calcium, and iron intake in the S group (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that dynapenia/sarcopenia affect a considerable proportion of postmenopausal women and are associated with rural residence, lower waist and hip circumference, lower bone density, low progesterone level and poor nutritional intake. Final conclusion will be drawn after completion of the study.Disclosures:This study is funded by Department of Health Research under Ministry of health and family welfare, Government of India for manpower and consumables The authors declare no conflicts of interest. Clair Hook1*, Keeley Abbott1, Harvey Regan1, Helen Egan11Birmingham City University, Birmingham, UKHaving overweight has been socially constructed as a correctable medical problem resulting from individuals’ behaviours and lifestyle choices. Although there are several factors which determine body size, overweight is construed as a personal and moral failure indicative of poor health. The implementation of changes for weight loss and weight loss maintenance are typically accorded to the individual and include perceived healthier meal planning and preparation. While weight loss maybe the outcome of revised behaviours, sustaining this poses the greatest endeavour for many. Qualitative explorations of weight loss maintenance have typically been derived from individuals who have lost weight but who have not experienced sustained weight loss. Seventeen people took part in semi-structured interviews and data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Three themes were generated about the strong perceived need for change, which was understood to be different from ‘being on a diet’ and the recognition of the role of self-criticism and self-kindness in affecting such changes. The analysis highlights that weight loss and weight loss maintenance are attributed to long-term lifestyle and behavioural changes framed as healthier living and underpinned by self-kindness and compassion. The visible changes of weight loss often ignite interest, enthusiasm and support from others. However, this is not characteristic of weight loss maintenance when revised behaviours are no longer novel and positive responses from others may dissipate. The absence of support for weight loss maintenance demonstrates a gap in the field.Disclosures:None Lucie Nield1*, Elysa Ioannou2, Martin Lamb2, Chris Brown2, Veronica Swallow2, Louisa Ells3, Catherine Homer21The University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK,2Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK,3Leeds Beckett University, UK,Living with excess weight in childhood is associated with a plethora of complications, which can persist into adulthood. Early intervention may limit excess weight gain and prevent the onset of associated long-term health conditions. Complications of Excess Weight (CEW) clinics are multidisciplinary tier 3 paediatric weight management services, set up in 2021/2022, run across England by the National Health Service. CEW clinics use a holistic approach to treating conditions related to obesity in children and young people (aged 2–18 years). ENHANCE (Evaluating the NHS EnglANd Complications of Excess weight services for Children and Young People) is a nationally commissioned evaluation of the 38 CEW clinics which aims to understand the experiences and perspectives of CYP, families, carers, clinicians, and commissioners to inform and optimise cost-effective care. A questionnaire has been sent (April-June 2025) to all CYP and families registered with a CEW service in England to explore their views and experiences. The responses to the surveys will be collated and for participants who provide consent, these will be followed up by longitudinal interviews, directed by a maximum variation sampling framework. Emerging quantitative and qualitative insights from the patients and families will be presented, including referral experiences, prior knowledge and expectations of CEW clinics, experience of attending (or not attending) CEW clinics, and overall experience. The realist-informed methodology will help us to present what works (or not) for whom, why, and under what circumstances, with particular focus on variables of significance to the CEW clinics such as neurodiversity, ethnicity and deprivation. The data provided by the questionnaires and interviews allows us to present a nuanced understanding of the CEW clinics and what is working or could be improved for those accessing care. The ongoing coproduction of the evaluation with policy makers, clinicians and our PPI team enables these insights to inform ongoing service development and commissioning at a national level.Disclosures:Research relating to this abstract was funded by the NIHR Health and Social Care Delivery Research programme (NIHR 158453).

Jordan Beaumont1*, Andrew Dolphin1, Lucie Nield21Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK,2University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UKObesity is a global health epidemic with many attempts to address the rising prevalence. Lifestyle weight management services – typically focussing on dietary and physical activity interventions – have been the backbone of much obesity treatment in the UK. Whilst producing modest weight loss, these services fail to promote sustained weight loss maintenance, largely due to placing onus on the individual to enact behaviours (e.g., “eat less and move more”) that do not reflect the complex nature of obesity. This systematic review synthesised evidence on the experience of adult lifestyle weight management services in the UK, exploring service user motivations for joining services and experience in the context of weight loss maintenance. Four databases were searched (Web of Science, CINAHL, Science Direct and Google Scholar) resulting in 46,050 records. Following screening, a total of 37 were included in the present review. These articles highlighted health as a powerful motivator for service uptake and engagement. The services increased users’ weight loss capability by creating a physically enabling and motivational social environment, with many barriers to access removed by online delivery (e.g., during COVID-19). However, users expressed reliance on accountability, social encouragement and relatedness for motivating engagement and achieving ‘successful’ weight loss. This reliance on programmes is a particular concern for weight loss maintenance, given many users are expected to maintain weight loss independent of the services. Capitalising on digital service possibilities may offer cost-effective solutions to physical accessibility barriers and a novel way of providing ongoing social support for weight loss maintenance.Disclosures:None Lucie Nield1,*, Thomas Burgoine2, Amelia Lake3, Helen Moore3, Jan Soon-Sinclair4, Jean Adams2, Tom Bishop2, Simon Bowles5, Emma Boyland6, Callum Bradford3, Michael Chang7, Steven Cummins8, Jordan Duffy3, Iain Ferris9, David Harness5, Yuru Huang2, Zainab Laheri4, Scott Lloyd3,8,10, Helen Martin5, Claire O’Malley3, Jo Pearce5, Chiara Rinaldi11, Rachel Rundle5, Nick Shaw10, Emma Tindall3, Tim Townshend10, Claire Wall5, Jordan Beaumont51University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK,2University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK,3Teesside University, Middlesbrough, UK,4University of Central Lancaster, Preston, UK,5Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK,6University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK,7Office for Health and Social Care, London, UK,8London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK,9Middlesbrough Council, Middlesbrough, UK,10Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK,11Gloucester Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Cheltenham, UK“Dark kitchens” are an innovative and potentially disruptive addition to the global food environment with potential implications for policy, practice and public health. In the UK, dark kitchens currently represent approximately 15% of all food retailers across the three major online food delivery platforms in England (e.g., Just Eat, Deliveroo, Uber Eats), contributing significantly to the digital food environment and increasing access and availability of high fat, salt, sugar (HFSS) food. To date, dark kitchens have been poorly defined, under researched and their wider impact (e.g. on health and obesity) poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this work was to coproduce a consensus definition of dark kitchens to be used across multiple disciplines. A series of consultations took place with stakeholders including consumers, local authority representatives, academics, dark kitchen employees and national governing bodies to understand knowledge and currently used definitions of dark kitchens. Mixed method approaches were used involving questionnaires, interviews, focus groups and workshops. The stakeholder consultation process provided a robust methodology through which a consensus definition of dark kitchens was agreed. In addition, short- and long-term benefits of such a definition were outlined for all stakeholder groups. The adoption of a consensus definition of dark kitchens is pivotal to the cross-sectoral work and understanding of many stakeholder groups. The definition allows for transparency and improved communication between dark kitchen stakeholders and provides the opportunity to drive public health agendas, including obesity, at multiple points within the food and obesogenic system.Disclosures:Research relating to this abstract was funded by the NIHR Application Development Awards programme (NIHR 160326).

Obesity in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, including spontaneous first trimester miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), venous thromboembolism (VTE), increased risk of caesarean birth, wound infections, and overall increased maternal morbidity and mortality. Fetal risks include a higher incidence of congenital anomalies and challenges in fetal surveillance. We aim to compare the management of women with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2at booking against the standard outlined by the Royal College of Obstetrician and Gynaecologists (RCOG). A registered retrospective audit was conducted over three months involving 46 pregnant women with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2. Data regarding antenatal, intrapartum and postpartum care was compared against RCOG guidelines on care of women with obesity in pregnancy. The audit demonstrated excellent compliance with antenatal and VTE risk assessment (100%), oral glucose tolerance test for diagnosis of GDM (100%), serial growth scan requests (100%) and BMI recording in third trimester (97%). Moderate compliance was noted with prescription of aspirin (82%), vitamin D (89%) and high-dose folic acid (74%). Only 4% of our cohort received a dietician referral. For women with BMI ≥40 kg/m2, low compliance rates were observed for referral to anaesthetist (23%) and moving and handling (0%). This audit has highlighted areas of improvement in certain aspect of antenatal care in women with obesity in pregnancy. Given the increased risk of neural tube defects in this population, initiation of 5 mg folic acid at least one month pre-conception and continued throughout the first trimester is essential. Implementation of antenatal checklist including screening for gestational diabetes, VTE risk assessment, serial growth scans for fetal growth and screening for mental health problems must be considered. A multidisciplinary approach involving senior obstetricians, specialist midwives, dietitians, and anaesthetists is recommended to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes, alongside individualized counselling and weight management support pre-conception and in between pregnancies.Disclosures:None Olivia Wood1*, Frederick Ho11School of Health and Wellbeing, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UKThere is an established association and longitudinal relationship between poor socio-emotional development and children living with obesity. This study aims to address the gap in knowledge regarding the bidirectional nature of this relationship and if it differs by gender. Data came from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children gathered at ages 6–7 and 15–17 years. BMI Z-scores and parent-completed Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) were used as measures of weight status and socio-emotional development respectively. Those excluded were without any SDQ or BMI data at the defined time points, with the remaining missing data for covariates handled using multiple imputation. This gave a cohort of 15645 with 2.5% living with obesity at baseline. Analysis utilised multivariable logistic regression modelling with adjustment for mother’s maternal age, socio-emotional factors and sex (prior to gender stratification). SDQ total difficulties at 6–7 were associated with higher odds of obesity at 15–17 (OR per 1-SD = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05–1.33, p = 0.008). Similarly for peer problems (OR per 1-SD = 1.16, 95% CI 1.01–1.34, p = 0.035), hyperactivity (OR per 1-SD = 1.18, 95% CI 1.05–1.33, p = 0.01) and conduct problems (OR per 1-SD = 1.10, 95% CI 1.07–1.32, p = 0.003). After gender stratification, this relationship was only significant for girls. A 1-SD higher in BMI at 6–7 was associated with increased odds of peer problems (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01–1.24, p = 0.027) at 15–17 but not the other domains of SDQ. At age 6–7 years, total difficulties, peer problems, conduct problems and hyperactivity was associated with increased odds of obesity at 15–17 years old but only in girls. Having a higher BMI at 6–7 was associated with peer problems at 15–17. These findings suggest addressing socio-emotional development at a young age can be a valuable starting point in reducing numbers living with obesity.Disclosures:None Corinne Bolland1*, Anna Robins1, Paul Sindall1, Phil Gray11University Of Salford, Salford, UKIn the UK, 26% of adults live with obesity, with higher prevalence in black adults (35%) and those living in the most deprived areas (36%). Obesity is associated with increased comorbidity, mortality and stigma with annual health-related costs exceeding £11.4-billion. Behavioural weight-management programmes (BWMPs) are the frontline treatment for obesity, yet evaluations show poor weight-loss, a lack of empowerment to maintain weight-loss, and poor cultural relevance. The World Health Organisation and UK policy endorse empowerment to reduce health disparity and to support citizens to successfully manage their weight. However, ‘empowerment’ is enigmatic; inadequately defined and therefore poorly understood. Currently, no examination of empowerment as it relates to an obesity BWMP context has been conducted to justify its widespread application. A scoping review was used to identify and consolidate the ways in which BWMPs have defined and implemented empowerment. Studies (n = 11) showed poor consensus in their design, theoretical grounding, definitions and implementations of empowerment. However, studies using community-based participatory approaches and user-involvement were successful in increasing BWMPs cultural relevance leading to increased engagement and retention, and positive health and wellbeing outcomes. No studies were found in a UK setting. To guide a consensus of empowerment in this context, definitions of empowerment and empowerment-based processes have been consolidated. Although good examples of empowerment practice are provided, poor consensus in the meanings and implementation of empowerment are pervasive. More research is required in a UK obesity BWMP setting to examine the specific meanings of empowerment, to facilitate translation within and between research, practice and policy.Disclosures:Corinne Bolland is funded by a University of Salford ‘Widening Participation’ internal scholarship.

Living with severe obesity in childhood has been linked to many significant physical comorbidities and negative mental health impacts. Social prescribing involves connecting CYP and families to community services in their local area for additional non-medical, holistic support. Social prescribing is a potential useful way to provide additional support to families accessing CEW, but it has not yet been used with this population. This study aims to explore how, in what ways and under what circumstances social prescribing may (or may not) work in CEW clinics to support the health and wellbeing of CYP living with severe obesity using a realist approach. Theories about how social prescribing might work within CEW clinics were developed through engagement with stakeholders including people with lived experience of obesity and clinical and community-based staff, alongside a review of the current literature. These theories were then refined through interviews with staff, patients and their families from a CEW clinic and staff working in community services. Early findings suggest that social prescribing was used in different ways to support families attending CEW clinics. This includes through referral to advice and information (targeted at parents/carers) and through referral to physical activities (targeted at CYP). Engagement with social prescribing required trust between the family and CEW staff, and a family support worker role (based in the CEW multi-disciplinary team) was crucial to developing this. Referral to advice and information was seen as positive and was suggested to support engagement with the CEW clinics and increase CEW staff capacity. Referral to physical activities provided social support to families, helping them to feel less alone as well as empowering young people. However, there were reported challenges around finding community activities which met the diverse needs of CEW families, potentially limiting long term outcomes. The findings from the interviews informed recommendations for CEW clinics, policy makers and commissioners around how social prescribing can be implemented within CEW clinics to support families.Disclosures:None Kath Williamson1,2*, Emilie Combet1, Lisa Kidd3, David Blane11University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK,2NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, UK,3Glasgow Caledonian University, Glasgow, UKThe Housebound Obesity Pathways and Engagement (HOPE) study focuses on engagement with Specialist Weight Management services for housebound people living with obesity (HPwO). HPwO can experience poor physical and mental function, high levels of external and internal weight stigma, and feel “stuck” both physically and psychologically. Engaging such underserved groups in research requires an inclusive research design to ensure the quality and relevance of research. We aim to work inclusively with HPwO to optimise outcomes for HOPE, adopting a learning approach (1). Using the six UK Standards for Public Involvement (2) we reflect on progress. First, inclusive opportunities: HOPE research questions came directly from patient feedback in clinical practice. Multiple networks are being used to reach public partners, including local and national clinical networks, advocacy groups for PwO and third sector organisations. Recruitment is ongoing (we currently have 2 Public Partners), aiming for a diverse group. Second, working together: giving Partners’ choice about how they contribute (by phone or online), time availability and clear expectations. We recognise that Partners’ health may affect their availability, understanding that their motivation to contribute may be affected by previous negative experiences of care. The third standard, support and learning to build confidence, is a key area for recognising the impact of internal and external weight stigma for HPwO. We strive to reduce this through use of person-first language and individual meetings, rather than group input. It also includes affirming the benefit of their contributions and valuing their experiences. For the fourth standard, communications, we are aiding partners to overcome barriers to engagement, such as one-to-one support using technology platforms. Fifth, we see the real impact of Public Partners improving research design, for example, suggesting key Facebook groups for lived experience, which we would otherwise miss. Finally, governance: the Partner’s role is recognised through payment, with agreed data processing arrangements. Future goals include increasing the diversity of Public Partners, particularly from men and ethnic minorities. Positive engagement with seldom-heard groups can occur: for HPwO this includes addressing weight stigma and being flexible in approach.References:1. National Institute for Health and Care Research.

Michelle Horridge1*, Jack Lewis1, Scott Crosby11Humber And North Yorkshire Integrated Care Board, Willerby, UK22.5% of reception-aged children in Hull are living with obesity. We know children living with obesity grow to be adults living with obesity. 90,000 adults living across Humber and North Yorkshire have a Body Mass Index of >35 (adjusted for ethnicity) and are living with at least 1 co-morbidity. There are long-term health implications of living with overweight and obesity. These issues disproportionately impact those at the greatest risk of health inequalities, as well as the health stigma faced by this cohort. Access to weight management services across Humber and North Yorkshire is inequitable. The aim of the Centre for Excellence is to develop an all-age, system wide healthy weight and treating obesity strategy to ensure equitable access to our population. We convene a local authority weight management meeting of experienced public health practitioners and an integrated care board steering group of senior public health leaders, clinicians and commissioners. We work with academic partners at Leeds Beckett University to engage service users and providers, to produce recommendations based on experiences of those working in and utilising the services. By working at both ends of the system, we aim to effect meaningful change. Undertaking primary prevention with places to change the obesogenic environment by creating advertising and sponsorship policies for harmful commodities including high fat, salt and sugar products. Acting to recommission specialist weight management services across the system to deliver the same level of care, including weight loss medications to the whole population. We acknowledge the challenges within this, around previously excluded groups; pregnant women, adults with learning disabilities and children. We acknowledge the need for a digital offer to be part of the services delivered. The development of the strategy to date has involved complex system working with multiple stakeholders, including those with lived experience, evolving treatment options and changing national policy. But the mandate for the Centre for Excellence and the population health team remains to put the health and wellbeing of our population at the centre of all we do, making services for those living with overweight and obesity fully equitable and accessible.Disclosures:None Anna Melekhina1*1Dietitian Center Of Anna Melekehina, Moscow, Russian FederationDietitians and nutritionists have guidelines with a big variety of recommendations. However, people can not change all eating habits at once. For this reason, it does not make sense to give people information about all eating habits during the first consultations. Moreover, information overload can be harmful for commitment and might create frustration. This is why, a specialist should make preferences of initial and postponed recommendations. I would like to introduce a system of creating a strategy for personal consultations. Firstly, specialists should make a list of the reasons for being overweight for a specific person during deep analysis. Secondly, experts should estimate the extent of the influence of each cause on a person’s weight and choose the main one. Thirdly, specialists should make a list of recommendations which can address the main causes. Next, experts should discuss recommendations with the person and teach them how to implement them in their real life. Finally, experts should demonstrate the whole strategy for forming ideas of gradual changes during a long-term diet therapy. In addition, I will show examples of strategies and involve the audience to decide which recommendations should be initial. My presentation can help practitioners to make their consultations more effective.Disclosures:My source of funding for the submitted work is my own salary, materials or project or programmes.

Although estimates vary, evidence suggests that up to 82% of children and young people (CYP) living with obesity exhibit at least one DEB, underscoring a significant overlap between higher weight and disordered eating. Complications from Excess Weight (CEW) clinics are an NHS England pilot providing specialist tier 3 multidisciplinary services supporting CYP with severe obesity. It is currently unknown what disordered eating assessments are used, and what support is available across clinics which may offer different models of care. This study explores current practices in recognising and responding to DEBs within CEW clinics across England. Data was collected from 30 CEW clinics in England via telephone interviews and/or surveys conducted between June 2024 and February 2025. As part of a larger survey, respondents were asked two questions on DEBs: (1) Is disordered eating formally assessed in your CEW service? (2) Is there any support offered in your service for disordered eating? Responses were analysed using content analysis and coded into quantitative categories. Of the 30 clinics interviewed, 30% (n = 9) reported formal and routine assessment for DEBs, 30% (n = 9) used informal or non-routine methods, and 40% (n = 12) did not assess for DEBs at all. Among the 18 clinics that assessed for DEBs, 33% (n = 6) provided no treatment, 50% (n = 9) offered in-house support for less severe DEBs and referred more complex cases to specialist eating disorder services. One clinic (6%) treated all DEBs within a specialist in-house team, while two clinics (11%) used the presence of DEBs as exclusion criteria for their service. CEW clinics offer a much-needed holistic multidisciplinary service to CYP with complex severe obesity. Whilst some larger clinics could offer in-house DEB assessment and support with trained staff, others do not offer this service. We stress the need for providing clear guidance and resource allocation to support CYP with co-occurring obesity and disordered eating.Disclosures:This analysis is funded by an NIHR Short Placement Research Award.

While TDR programmes for weight loss and T2D remission are available within NHS services, their effectiveness is unclear for this high-risk group. This study compared outcomes (at 12 weeks) between individuals with early-onset (<40 years old) and later-onset T2D (≥40 years old), participating in an NHS TDR T2D remission programme. This service evaluation analysed data from individuals enrolled in the NHS Tayside Counterweight-Plus T2D remission programme between 2021 and 2024. This 12-month programme is a group-based intervention delivered by dietitians and psychologists, incorporating a 12-week TDR phase (800–900 kcals/day liquid formula diet) followed by food reintroduction and weight maintenance support. We assessed weight, HbA1C, and TDR completion at the start and end of the 12 week TDR period. Chi-Squared and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to analyse differences between the early- and later-onset groups. Of 189 participants enrolled, 47 (25%) had early-onset T2D (mean age 33.7 years (SD 4.2)) and 142 (75%) had later-onset T2D (mean age 52.1 years (SD 7.6)). The early-onset group had a mean baseline BMI of 45.1 kg/m2 (SD 11.8), HbA1c 66.2 mmol/mol (18.6), with 62% female and 60% living in areas of high deprivation. The later-onset group had a mean baseline BMI of 42.7 kg/m2 (SD 12.9), HbA1c 63.2 mmol/mol (SD 18.5), with 59% female and 41.5% living in high deprivation areas. A lower proportion of the early-onset group completed the TDR phase compared to the later-onset group (70% vs. 87%, χ2 = 9.07, p = .003, Phi = −.219),). Among those who completed TDR, there were no significant differences in weight loss (−12.6% vs. −12.4%; Mann-WhitneyU = 1645, p = .46) or HbA1c reduction (−16 mmol/mol vs −14 mmol/mol; Mann-WhitneyU = 1501, p = .95) between the early and later-onset groups. Initial findings suggest that younger adults with T2D achieve comparable weight loss and HbA1c reductions to older adults within a TDR-led behavioural weight management programme, albeit with modestly lower completion. Further research is needed to assess longer term weight loss maintenance and retention outcomes in this younger, high-risk population.Disclosures:None Amanda Jayne Mathieson1*, Gagan Preet2, Amane Alaroud1, Marcel Jaspars2, Andreas Kolb11Rowett Institute, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK,2Department of Chemistry, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UKPer- or Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are disruptors of lipid metabolism. In humans PFAS exposure is associated with increased serum cholesterol levels. In mice addition of PFAS to diet leads to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In cell lines PFAS promote lipid uptake and oxidative stress. However, PFAS compounds show almost no direct toxicity to tissue culture cell lines. Their effects are therefore thought to be due to their action as endocrine disruptors. At a molecular level PFAS have been shown to interact with the nuclear receptor PPARα. However, the main transcriptional response to PFAS exposure in liver cells is a downregulation of the nuclear receptor FXR, the main regulator and sensor of bile acid concentration in the body. In accordance with published data we find that treatment of HepG2 cells with PFOS and PFOA significantly reduces the expression of the Cyp7A1 gene, which encodes the main enzyme regulating bile acid synthesis. This is consistent with the increase of serum cholesterol. A molecular modelling analysis (using Autodock Vina) of FXR and PPARα demonstrated almost equal affinity of PFOS and PFOA to the ligand binding domain of both nuclear receptors. Analysis of a library of 15000 PFAS compounds demonstrated a strong affinity of many compounds to the ligand binding domain of FXR. Affinity towards other liver specific transcription factors, including PPARα, ERα, and HNF4α was substantially lower. FXR as a major regulator of mammalian cholesterol metabolism may therefore constitute a key mediator of endocrine disruption by PFAS compounds.Disclosures:None Nesreen Baobid1*, Christine Edwards1, Douglas Morrison1, Dalia Malkova11University Of Glasgow, Glasgow, UKWe previously demonstrated that consuming 3 g of β-glucan with energy-restricted breakfast and dinner, and low-carbohydrate lunch increased peptide YY (PYY) and reduced acylated ghrelin and composite appetite score (CAS) in individuals living with overweight/obesity. The current study investigated whether CAS, appetite hormones and body mass loss are impacted when β-glucan is supplemented during a 4-week energy and carbohydrate-restricted diet. Sedentary, healthy females were randomly assigned in a parallel intervention to 4 weeks energy and carbohydrate-restricted diet combined with 9g β-glucan/day (β-glucan group) or 9g cellulose/day (Placebo group). Energy-restricted meal replacements (~200 kcal) were consumed at breakfast and dinner. Lunch was low-carbohydrate meal providing 35% of habitual energy intake. Data were analysed using ANOVA. The study was completed by forty-nine participants (age: 41 ± 10 years, BMI: 31 ± 5 kg/m2). Both groups experienced a reduction in body mass and fat mass. Reduction in body mass (β-glucan, −3.13 ± 1.45 kg; Placebo, −1.85 ± 1.04 kg) and fat mass (β-glucan, −2.3 ± 1.3 kg; Placebo, −1.4 ± 1.2 kg) was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in the β-glucan group. In the β-glucan group, concentration of total ghrelin and acylated ghrelin significantly (P < 0.05) decreased. In the placebo group, concentration of total ghrelin did not change (P > 0.05) while acylated ghrelin concentration significantly increased (P < 0.05). Changes in total ghrelin (β-glucan, −131 ± 215 pg/ml; Placebo, 100 ± 302 pg/ml) and acylated ghrelin (β-glucan, −69.77 ± 114.25 pg/ml; Placebo, 73.61 ± 71.69 pg/ml) were significantly different (P < 0.05) between groups. There were no changes in fasting PYY and GLP-1 in both groups. Fasting and time-averaged postprandial CAS significantly decreased in the β-glucan group (P < 0.05), but no change was found in the placebo group (P > 0.05). Thus, supplementing a low-calorie, low-carbohydrate diet with β-glucan can enhance weight loss, probably by reducing ghrelin and appetite.Disclosures:This study was conducted as a part of the PhD and was funded by the University of Glasgow and Saudi Arabia government.

It is recommended under two primary guidelines: for type 2 diabetes and for weight loss, in conjunction with dietary and lifestyle interventions. A key consideration is access and delivery, given the potential impact on NHS resources. NHS England published commissioning guidance for its use during the first three years of NHS implementation. We reviewed data from our weight management clinics, where 625 patients underwent initial assessment for medical or surgical management (from April 2024 to March 2025), with the referrals based on the NICE guidelines on obesity management (NG246). Of these, 372 patients (male:female 1:2.7) progressed to further evaluation. Medical management was selected by 243 patients, while 96 opted for surgical intervention. Patients were stratified into Cohort Access Groups I–III, following NHS England’s “cohorting approach” for phased implementation of tirzepatide: 11 patients (3%) were in Cohort I, 5 (1.2%) in Cohort II, and 30 (7.6%) in Cohort III. Forty-two patients were identified as eligible under the NICE guideline (TA924) for tirzepatide use in type 2 diabetes and 26 commenced tirzepatide therapy. Their baseline weights ranged from 75 to 175 kg (mean 111.9 kg), and BMI ranged from 29.3 to 61.3 kg/m2(mean 40.5 kg/m2). Weight, BMI, HbA1c, antidiabetic regimen, and other metabolic parameters were assessed at 3–4 and 5–6 months after initiation. Twenty-five patients experienced weight loss; one patient’s weight remained unchanged. The maximum weight loss at 3–4 months was 12 kg (mean 6.4 kg; average BMI reduction 2.3 kg/m2), and at 5–6 months, the maximum loss was 15 kg (mean 6.6 kg; average BMI reduction 2.4 kg/m2). Additional benefits included mean HbA1c reduction of 16.7 mmol/mol and 28–52% reduction in insulin use. These real-world findings suggest that tirzepatide is effective in improving both weight and metabolic outcomes in people with obesity and type 2 diabetes, with a notable reduction in insulin dependency. However, as a substantial proportion of patients with obesity in our cohort fall outside the initial three access groups, the 2–3-year delay in availability may carry significant metabolic consequences.Disclosures:None Anne Moorhead1*, Fiona Quigley1, Alexander Miras2, Michael Crotty31Ulster University, Belfast, UK,2Ulster University, Derry/Londonderry, UK,3Irish College of General Practitioners, Dublin, IrelandObesity remains a global public health challenge, with obesity rates predicted to further increase. Obesity care is a cornerstone of addressing obesity but globally patients still report lack of access to effective obesity-related services. Therefore, leadership among healthcare professionals (HCPs) in obesity care is important. It is essential to review obesity care strategies, in order to enable HCPs to better support their patients. This research was a scoping literature review, with the question: “What are the obesity care strategies enabling healthcare professionals to improve decision-making, communication and healthcare solutions?” This review was based on Arksey and O’Malley’s Framework (2005), between 2014–2025 following the PRISMA guidelines. In total, 28 primary studies were identified. From these studies, obesity care and support strategies, including decision-making and communication, were identified in three categories, 1. Structural strategies, such as policy and research; 2. General strategies, such as improvements in multidisciplinary approaches; 3. Population specific strategies, such as pre and antenatal care. This review demonstrates HCPs are calling for leadership at a structural level, for strategies towards improving policy, addressing weight stigma on a societal and on a provider level, as well as ensuring that services are adequately resourced and financed. HCPs themselves when consulted can articulate the challenges they face, the resources they need and the successful strategies and tools they employ when providing obesity care and support to patients. HCPs report common challenges and barriers to obesity care, which are also reported in research, but these gaps still remain unaddressed. Person-centred communication is essential to effective obesity care. Decision-making covers all aspects of the patient journey, such as when and how to raise the topic of weight to referral to secondary support services. Solutions for healthcare professionals in obesity care were identified, including the need for shared messaging concerning obesity. This review provided recommendations to improve obesity care through healthcare leadership. In conclusion, HCPs are aware of the challenges and potential solutions for improving obesity care but there is a lack of investment at government level globally. There is also a need for more consistently in communication and decision-making strategies in obesity care.Disclosures:This work was funded by Ulster University. Yue Wang1*, Alice Kininmonth1, Emma Young1, Jason Halford1, Alison Fildes11University Of Leeds, Leeds, UKWeight stigma refers to the social devaluation and discrimination of individuals perceived as living with overweight or obesity. Categorised as experienced, internalised, or anticipated, stigma is linked with negative physical and psychological outcomes. Bidirectional relationships between stigma and adiposity have not been systematically explored across different stigma types. This systematic review explored relationships between types of weight stigma with adiposity across childhood into adulthood. This review followed PRISMA guidelines and employed a narrative synthesis (PROSPERO registration: CRD 42024534245). Studies reporting quantifiable relationships between stigma and adiposity in participants aged 4–65 were eligible. Searches conducted in August 2024 using Ovid Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE yielded 14,408 records. After abstract and full-text screening, 25 truly longitudinal studies were included in the final synthesis. Of these studies, 16/25 were in adults (8 internalised, 7 experienced, 1 anticipated), 5/25 were in children (1 internalised, 4 experienced), and 4/25 spanned childhood to adulthood (all experienced). Findings show consistent positive relationships between stigma and adiposity in child and child-to-adult studies. 2/5 child studies and 4/4 child-to-adult studies reported positive relationships from experienced stigma to later adiposity, while 3/5 child studies (2 experienced, 1 internalised) and 1/4 child-to-adult studies reported positive relationships from adiposity to stigma. Findings from adult studies were more mixed. For internalised stigma: 5/8 studies showed positive relationships from stigma to adiposity, 1/8 showed positive relationships from adiposity to stigma, and 3/8 showed no relationship. For experienced stigma: 3/7 studies reported positive relationships from stigma to adiposity, 1/7 reported negative relationships from stigma to adiposity, 2/7 reported no relationships, and 1/7 reported positive relationships from adiposity to stigma only. The single anticipated stigma study reported no relationship with adiposity. Of the 5/25 studies examining bidirectional relationships, only 2/5 (one adult internalised, one child-adult experienced) reported significant effects in both directions. Potential identified mediators of the stigma-adiposity relationship included negative emotional symptoms and perceived stress, while gender, baseline weight status, and stigma source were suggested moderators. A lack of validated tools for assessing experienced stigma was identified. These findings underscore the need for increased societal awareness, improved assessments, and stigma-reduction interventions from early life.Disclosures:None Mia Alexander1*, Luciana Torquati1, Jeffrey Lambert2, Mark Tarrant31University Of Exeter, Exeter, UK,2University of Bath, Bath, UK,3University of Plymouth, Plymouth, UKThe body mass index of the global population is rapidly increasing, with an anticipated 54% of individuals living with overweight or obesity by 2035. Despite the chronicity of obesity, treatment impacts are relatively short-term, with 80% of individuals experiencing weight regain one year after treatment. Weight loss maintenance is exceptionally challenging but offers many health benefits including reduced comorbidities. Barriers to weight loss maintenance include waning social support, fear of weight regain and lack of satisfaction (e.g., no decreasing number on scales). Changing social networks and previous experiences of weight stigma, which can psychologically “scar” individuals, often makes weight loss maintenance psychosocially complex. This systematic review will identify the known psychosocial impact of weight loss maintenance on individuals who are or were living with obesity. A literature search of five databases (Medline, PsychInfo, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science) was conducted in May 2024 and was updated in April 2025. Search results are currently undergoing second review. Of the initial 3,778 results, 20 studies met the inclusion criteria and were assessed for risk of bias and certainty of evidence. The preliminary narrative synthesis showed that the research demographic was primarily White females and only 10% of the study populations were weight loss maintainers, with the remainder representing comparison groups (e.g., general population, treatment seeking individuals). Overall, 14 psychosocial outcomes were assessed and 64% of those outcomes were significantly impacted by weight loss maintenance. Initial syntheses found that quality of life improved with maintenance duration, with no clear evidence of interaction between maintenance duration and depression. Meanwhile, depressive symptoms and perceived stress were lower in those maintaining weight loss compared to controls including those who sought treatment or regained initial weight loss. Anxiety was higher during weight loss maintenance compared to non-maintenance controls. However, so far, the included studies were highly heterogeneous and provided low evidence certainty. These initial results indicate some need for targeted psychosocial support for those maintaining weight loss but, primarily, results highlighted gaps in the literature and future research directions. These include planned sub-group analyses for separate weight loss trajectories and inclusion of more diverse populations.Disclosures:Economic and Social Research Council South West Doctoral Training Partnership 1 + 3 studentship. AB Sirin Ayva1*, James Roast1, Sophie Edwards1, Paul Gately11Morelife UK, Leeds Beckett UniversityMorelife UK is a healthy lifestyle service provided across the UK. This service provides a Postpartum Weight Management Service (PNWMS) (integrating two priority areas—perinatal mental health and infant-parent relationships) for individuals who have given birth in the last year. Maternal obesity and weight retention after birth are not only associated with socio economic deprivation, but also numerous health risks for both women and baby. Evidence suggests people living with obesity when they become pregnant have poorer mental health compared to their healthier weight counterparts. PPWR is a strong predictor of obesity in later life with long term health consequences in women, including coronary heart disease, some cancers and type II diabetes. The service, a postpartum lifestyle intervention, will function to enable people to thrive and realise their potential, promoting healthier lifestyles and reducing postpartum weight retention (PPWR). This programme aims to support 200 individuals BMI > 25 and aged 18 and over (<18, with parental consent), who gave birth in the last year by delivering weekly support for up to twelve weeks. Postnatal weights will either self-reported by clients or taken during face-to-face sessions offered by the service. Qualitative data will be gathered via a client feedback survey to evaluate participants’ experiences and the impact of the programme on their physical and mental health. Quantitative data will include number of completers losing weight, maintaining healthy BMI, improved wellbeing, nutrition, physical activity, confidence around healthy eating and connection with their baby. The groups will start in early January 2025 and will be completed by April 2025. Preliminary outcomes from qualitative and quantitative data will be available to be analysed by the end of April.Disclosures:None AB Sirin Ayva1*, Sophie Edwards1, Victoria Simpson1, Paul Gately11Morelife UK, Leeds Beckett UniversityIndividuals living in deprived areas may experience some barriers to accessing weight management services. Common barriers include language barriers, shift work, childcare, and lifestyle. Research shows that digital interventions help support weight loss in adults living with obesity and overweight. MyLifePlan (MLP) was created by Morelife, an interactive digital platform consisting of 12 weekly sessions with educational videos, recipes, podcasts and other nutrition, physical activity and psychology resources. The platform is accessible through mobile phones and computers. It has Auto-translation to 98 languages and ReachDeck assistive technologies: text-to-speech, translations, Picture Dictionary, Screen Mask (reduces visual stress/improves focus), text magnifier, webpage simplifier (removes potentially distracting content), and multiple formats including Easy Read. Recipes on this platform reflect a variety of cultures, religions, beliefs and financial pressures. The platform has progress and interactive goals/exercise trackers, motivational and personalised nudges and interactive challenges. This digital platform has been offered to Morelife clients as an option for weight management purposes. This service evaluation aims to analyse the outcomes of the MLP platform. In total, 262 (155 female, 107 male) clients completed the digital programme by engaging with the content for 12 weekly sessions and uploading their self-measured weight between weeks 8 and 12. 215 (82%) had hypertension, 49 (19%) Type 1 diabetes and 61 (23%) Type 3 2 diabetes. Outcomes show that 189 (72 %) clients lost more than 3% of their initial body weight, and 126 (48%) clients lost more than 5% of their initial body weight. 49% of those with hypertension, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, 49%, 29% and 46% achieved over 5% weight loss respectively. These outcomes show that the MLP digital programme helps clients with hypertension and diabetes lose weight in 12 weeks. Future research is needed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of this platform for weight loss maintenance and to identify characteristics of those most likely to have success using a digital platform for weight management.Disclosures:None Kate Roberts1*1Sunderland And South Tyneside NHS Foundation Trust, Sunderland, UKThere is a large cohort of children within the South Tyneside and Sunderland Childhood Weight Management Service who are living with overweight or obesity and either: selective eaters or have hyperphagia. It can be a challenge for parents to support their children, and they report frustration and anxiety. This pilot is exploring the feasibility of delivering optional online peer support for parents to: reduce parental stress; empower parents to share lived experience and strategies; improve mental health of parents by providing peer support; provide structured education to improve behaviour; improve anthropometric outcomes in children’s BMI centiles and waist to height circumference. Parents were invited via letter to monthly online sessions on Microsoft Teams with 15 minutes of structured education and 45 minutes of facilitated discussion and peer support. Text invites with the link to join were sent the day before the sessions. Attendance was monitored and the Parent Stress Scale used (1). Children continue to attend regular clinic appointments where anthropometrics are measured. Despite initial enthusiasm from parents, attendance of groups has been low. Reasons include difficulties joining Microsoft Teams via Text invites and inconvenient times. It has so far not been possible to gather any parent stress scale data. Parents have subsequently been surveyed to get preferred times for groups. The pilot has revealed poor attendance of optional online peer support groups suggesting that feasibility of delivery using the current model is poor. We will be adapting the methods to use email invites and sending QR codes to facilitate ease of joining Teams meetings and will offer a range of group times including evenings. Input from parents will be gathered to develop the service going forward.References:1. Berry JO, Jones WH. The parental stress scale: Initial psychometric evidence.

This systematic review, adhering to PRISMA guidelines, synthesized data from genome-wide association studies (South Asian Genome Consortium, n = 75,000), national health surveys (India’s NFHS-5, Pakistan’s PDHS), the MetaCardis gut microbiome cohort, and WHO policy reports. Key findings include: 1) The APOC3 rs5128 variant elevated triglycerides by 32% (OR = 1.42, p < 0.001), while smog in cities like Lahore hypermethylated IL6, increasing inflammation (C-reactive protein ≥3 mg/L); 2) Polished rice (glycemic index: 73) and trans-fat-laden snacks impaired endothelial function within 4 weeks (flow-mediated dilation ↓2.1%); 3) Gut dysbiosis (Prevotella-dominant microbiomes) doubled trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) levels (≥6 µM vs. 3 µM controls), a biomarker for myocardial infarction. Interventions demonstrated millet-based diets reduced HbA1c by 0.8%, and community yoga programs lowered systolic blood pressure by 10 mmHg, rivalling antihypertensives. Policy action—subsidizing statins in underserved areas, banning trans fats, and redesigning cities for walkability—must align with cultural strategies like integrating millets into school meals and yoga into primary care.

According to PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review synthesized evidence from policy evaluations (OECD reports, South Korea’s National Obesity Management Program, 2018–2023), psychosocial metrics (U.S. Census data, CDC PLACES database), and neuroimaging data (NeuroVault repository, focusing on prefrontal cortex and amygdala activity). Key findings showed that SSRIs worsen metabolic health by activating histamine receptors, leading to 3–5 kg of weight gain annually, while leptin resistance and interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis destabilize emotional regulation. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) increase obesity risk by 34% through cortisol-induced visceral fat deposition (OR = 1.34). Neuroimaging revealed neural deficits affecting decision-making, including decreased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity and amygdala hyperactivity. Digital CBT reduced emotional eating by 40%, and GLP-1 agonists like semaglutide significantly cut weight and depressive symptoms. However, systemic disparities persist: weight stigma in healthcare deters treatment seeking, and 23% of American neighborhoods are food deserts, correlating with higher obesity rates. Policy initiatives like South Korea’s program have lowered national obesity prevalence by 8% through subsidized fitness access and anti-stigma campaigns. Integrating trauma-informed care and AI-driven personalized interventions could address both biological and structural drivers. Sustainable solutions combine pharmacological advances with urban policies to tackle food deserts and clinician bias. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies of neurobiological resilience and scalable digital therapies to bridge the gap between individual pathophysiology and societal inequities.Disclosures:None Vivien Coates1, Aisling Donnelly1*, Toni McAloon1, Alexander Miras11Ulster University, Derry/Londonderry, UKObesity is recognised as a multifactorial and chronic disease that can impact on health. Obesity Canada and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) evidence-based guidelines provide comprehensive recommendations for the management of obesity, ranging from health promotion to specialist overweight and obesity management services. The guidelines emphasise an individualised approach to treatment and the need for long-term support. Despite the guidelines’ recommendations, access to care is inconsistent and geographically dependent, not only in Northern Ireland but throughout the wider UK and internationally due to varying government policies and priorities. This review aimed to explore the contrast between what is currently recommended as best practice for the management of obesity against the limited services available in practice. It found that despite guideline recommendations, obesity is under-prioritised, as people with obesity are still not likely to experience effective obesity management, with access to care notably less accessible compared to other chronic diseases. It is evident from the literature that a ‘postcode lottery’ is a global issue, where access to care is based on geographical location rather than clinical need. Compared to other chronic diseases, obesity is yet to be seen as a priority locally, nationally, or internationally. Guidelines recommend obesity and weight management services, however, they are not mandatory, and this can lead to inequity in service provision as local commissioners may not prioritise or fund these services despite the economic costs associated with obesity and the cost to the individual. Furthermore, evidence suggests that healthcare providers may under-prioritise obesity due to a lack of knowledge and their own implicit bias towards people with obesity. A cultural shift in how obesity is understood and addressed is required to address the ingrained weight stigma that remains pervasive within society. The guidelines alone do not lead to improved services required for systemic change. To address this, governments, policymakers, and healthcare providers must ensure that obesity is prioritised and treated as a chronic disease, as with other chronic diseases.Disclosures:None Zara Khan1*, Amina Khanam11Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust, London, UKSubcutaneous semaglutide was the first glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal for weight loss. Obesity is linked to an increased risk of vitamin D deficiency, likely due to sequestration in adipose tissue leading to reduced bioavailability. Tobias et al. found reduced efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in patients with elevated body mass index (BMI) in a large 2023 cohort study, suggesting altered metabolism. Recent studies have recommended weight-adjusted vitamin D dosing for individuals living with obesity. We investigate the impact of GLP-1 agonist treatment for obesity on vitamin D levels and bone health. 11 patients initiated on subcutaneous semaglutide in a Tier 4 bariatric service were identified. We looked at pre-and post-semaglutide 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels, bone health parameters, and supplementation practices. 91% of patients had baseline 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels tested, with 63% classified as deficient or insufficient. All 37% of patients with deficiency (<25 nmol/L) received once weekly 40,000 IU cholecalciferol for 7 weeks. 27% were prescribed maintenance vitamin D (400–800 IU once a day) by their GP, although 66% of these patients reported they were not concordant with this. 36% were taking over-the-counter supplementation. None were taking weight-adjusted doses. 45% were not taking maintenance supplementation. The patients who were not taking maintenance supplementation had all had deficient or insufficient levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D on their most recent blood results. No patients had repeat vitamin D levels tested after initiation of semaglutide. 2 patients underwent bone density (DEXA) scans due to previous fracture history and were found to have osteopaenia. No new fractures were reported. Although GLP-1 agonists decrease bone resorption, obesity is associated with vitamin D deficiency and weight loss has been shown to reduce vitamin D levels and bone mineral density. Patients taking semaglutide require bone health screening and regular monitoring to allow early intervention for patients with an increased fracture risk. Weight-adjusted dosing of cholecalciferol is recommended. We aim to follow up this small group with repeat vitamin D testing and comparison with a larger cohort of patients taking semaglutide.Disclosures:None Tatiana Christmas1*, Rajalakshmi Valaiyapathi1, Kishor Raja1, Cansu Ozdemir2, Ruvini Ranasinghe1, Georgios K Dimitriadis2, Ameet G Patel2,3, Royce P Vincent1,21Department of Clinical Biochemistry (Synnovis Analytics), King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UK,2Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King’s College London, UK,3Department of Minimal Access Surgery, King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UKPatients who undergo metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) are at high risk of micronutrient deficiencies. We describe a case whereby multiple MBS procedures were performed, resulting in refractory zinc (Zn) deficiency. Paired scalp hair and serum Zn (sZn) concentrations (CRP <20 mg/L) were analysed using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry in an UKAS accredited laboratory. A 45-year-old female underwent a primary laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for class 3 obesity in 2005. She achieved very good post-surgical weight reduction, but regained weight following pregnancy. Hence, she underwent laparoscopic biliopancreatic diversion and duodenal switch in 2015. She developed Zn deficiency despite multivitamin supplements including a Zn:copper (Cu) ratio of 8–15 mg:1 mg (min 2 mg Cu). Four months post-surgery, sZn was 9.0 µmol/L (reference range 11–19) and dropped to 7.5 µmol/L at eight months, with symptoms consistent with Zn deficiency (hair loss, poor wound healing and mouth ulcers). She was on maximum tolerable oral Zn over the next four years but demonstrated refractory Zn deficiency with normal Cu. She was trialled on IV Zn sulfate infusions in 2019 with modest improvement in sZn but could not sustain it. With the aim of reducing post-surgical gastrointestinal (GI) side effects and correcting Zn deficiency, laparoscopic conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and distal gastrectomy were performed in 2022. Post-surgery, the GI side effects settled, but she remained Zn deficient with hair loss. Six months post-surgery, sZn was 8.1 µmol/L, but hair Zn (hZn) was only slightly below the lower limit of in-house reference range at 142.9 µg/g dry weight (150–250). In 2024, she was given monthly IV Zn for six months. Pre-infusion sZn peaked at 12.26 µmol/L (ave. 8.15) and hZn at 158.9 µg/g (ave. 142.8) with notable reduction in hair loss. There was no statistical correlation between sZn and hZn. A fall in sZn (50%) and hZn (29%) were evident three months after stopping infusions. hZn could be more reflective of the total body Zn reserve, indicating a potential utility of hZn analysis in refractory deficiency state. Our patient continues to receive intermittent IV Zn, alongside regular oral Zn supplements. This case highlights the challenges in managing micronutrient deficiencies after MBS.Disclosures:None Louise Sarr1*, Faye Taylor2, Dimitri Pournaras2, James Hopkins2, Kathryn Lonnen1,2, Hassan Kahal1,21Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK,2Weight management and Bariatric service, North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UKObesity is common in people with Type 1 Diabetes. Managing T1DM during bariatric surgery presents unique challenges to avoid hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. We present two cases of people with T1DM who underwent bariatric surgery in our service. Case 1: A 39yr old woman with T1DMTHIS, BMI 40 kg/m2, underwent sleeve gastrectomy. Her diabetes was diagnosed 15 years ago. Her GAD and IA-2 antibodies were positive, and she had intermediate c-peptide at 204 pmol/L in 2025. Her HbA1c was 43 mmol/mol preoperatively. At the start of the liver reducing diet (LRD) her long-acting insulin was reduced by 30%, and insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (ICR) was weakened from 1 unit to 3 grams of carbohydrates (1:3) to 1:4. Further reductions in long-acting insulin by 70% and ICR to 1:5 were required by day 3 into the LRD given hypoglycemic events. Post-surgery, her blood glucose levels remained stable, and she did not require short-acting insulin by day 10. She experienced approximately 24% weight loss 3 months post-surgery. Case 2: A 49yr old man with T1DM (diagnosed 41 years ago), BMI 48 kg/m2, and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis underwent a gastric band insertion. His HbA1c was 49 mmol/mol prior to surgery. During the LRD, his long-acting insulin was gradually reduced by 50% and the short acting insulin reduced by 36%. At day 5 post-operatively his long-acting insulin requirements dropped to 30% and he required negligible short acting insulin. This gradually increased again with ongoing insulin titration. He experienced a 24% weight loss at 15 months and was placed on the kidney transplant waiting list. Both cases were reviewed by a consultant endocrinologist prior to commencing on the LRD and required close monitoring by the diabetes specialist and bariatric nurses. Neither patient had severe hypoglycemia or DKA. Bariatric surgery is an effective and life-changing procedure in people with T1DM. A multidisciplinary team approach and careful insulin management are important to ensure safety and avoid severe hypoglycemia and DKA peri-operatively. There is a need for national guidelines on how to manage insulin around bariatric surgery in people with T1DM.Disclosures:None Jessica Wright1, Janette Mackay Macdonald1*, Ben Thomas11Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, Canary Wharf, UKYellow Card Biobank pilot is a collaboration between Genomics England and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to help understand how a patient’s genetics can impact the safety of their medicines.

Furthermore, 66% of adults live with overweight and obesity in the Grampian Health Board area (2). The causes of obesity are multifactorial and often beyond the control of individuals, with many causes related to the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, known as the social determinants of health. A Whole Systems Approach (WSA) to obesity - which shifts focus away from individuals and places emphasis on understanding and improving social determinants - is considered an effective mechanism for delivering equitable change in a complex and unpredictable social system. In 2024, Aberdeen City Council (ACC), Community Planning Aberdeen (CPA) - the City’s strategic collaborative of public, private and third sector organisations - and NHS Grampian launched a WSA to Healthy Weight in Aberdeen City. The approach is being co-developed with local stakeholders, including the NIHR Health Determinants Research Collaboration Aberdeen (HDRCA), hosted at ACC. Working in partnership with ACC and CPA, the HDRCA is uniquely placed to provide the local evidence base that can be developed to progress the WSA, capture the learning during this process and support an evaluation of the approach. The HDRCA will review current local outcome improvement projects related to the WSA, including those addressing diet, physical activity and associated health inequalities, to identify what has worked and where there are evidence-based interventions that can be included in future action plans. Building on previous WSA evaluations that have been predominantly process focused rather than process and outcome focused, the HDRCA will support evaluative strategies that seek to address both the process and outcomes of local healthy weight interventions. Engaging a HDRC represents a novel approach to systems change, ensuring that a social determinants lens is employed throughout the implementation, evaluation and adaptation of the WSA.References:1.

Paul MacDonald1*, Derek Peters1, Helen Franks1, Rebecca Stack11University of Worcester, Worcester, UKThe relationship between knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs (KAB) is complex and reciprocal, not merely cause-and-effect. Accurately measuring KAB is vital for understanding healthcare professionals’ (HCPs’) perspectives and supporting evidence-based practices in obesity management. To gain meaningful insights, measurement tools must be well-designed and psychometrically robust. This scoping review aimed to identify and evaluate published measurement tools that assess HCPs’ KAB regarding adult obesity, utilising the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) framework. This scoping review adhered to the COSMIN methodology and the five-stage framework by Arksey and O’Malley, refined by Levac and Colquhoun. Reviewers searched databases—Embase, Medline, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Google Scholar—for studies from January 1, 1999, to April 15, 2023, with an updated search from April 15, 2023, to May 1, 2025. Inclusion criteria focused on HCPs’, KAB tools for adult obesity, and related tool development or testing. Two reviewers screened the literature and extracted data, consulting a third for consensus when necessary. Measurement properties were assessed using the COSMIN criteria. A total of 9,213 records were identified, with 5,454 screened for abstract review. An updated search from April 15, 2023, to May 1, 2025, added 84 records, all screened for full-text eligibility. Ultimately, 45 articles were assessed for full-text eligibility, leading to the exclusion of 41, leaving 4 articles for final review. According to COSMIN criteria, these studies had inadequate methodological quality, lacking sufficient content validity due to unrepresentative HCP samples and poorly defined constructs. The findings reveal a significant gap in rigorously developed tools for assessing HCPs’ KAB regarding adult obesity. The lack of validated measurement instruments limits our understanding of how providers manage this issue. Previous research often relies on outdated methodologies, highlighting the urgent need for contemporary tools that meet quality standards, such as those in the COSMIN framework. Current tools for assessing HCPs’ KAB regarding adult obesity may be inadequate. Future research should focus on developing robust, contemporary, and validated measurement tools to improve obesity-related research and clinical practice.Disclosures:Self-funding PhD - Tuition Fees supported via The CSP Charitable Trust, The Private Physiotherapy Education Foundation and the Herefordshire and Worcestershire NHS Health and Care Trust.

However, limited data from non-western countries has been reported on associations of domain-specific physical activity with obesity and fitness, or their role in mediating cardiometabolic risk factors and their endpoints. We aimed to investigate associations of physical activity with obesity and resting heart rate as both outcomes and mediators of the relationship with cardiometabolic risk factors and disease endpoints. In ecological analyses, we examined associations between agricultural employment (200 countries) and self-reported domain-specific physical activity (aggregated, 100 countries) with obesity prevalence as an outcome and as a mediator of diabetes. In cross-sectional analyses, we examined associations of domain-specific physical activity with BMI and resting heart rate as outcome variables and as mediators of the relationship with fasting glucose, cholesterol, and blood pressure. In ecological analyses, agricultural employment (per SD = 20%) was inversely associated with obesity prevalence (RR 0.62; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.76) and diabetes prevalence (RR 0.75; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.86). Self-reported occupational physical activity (per SD = 487 minutes/week) was also inversely associated with diabetes prevalence (RR 0.80; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.90). In individual-level cross-sectional analyses, self-reported physical activity was inversely associated with resting heart rate and BMI. Physical activity was also inversely associated with fasting glucose and total cholesterol across all domains investigated, but associations with blood pressure appeared to be positive for occupational activity. At the same level of overall activity, a higher proportion of activity accumulated through occupation was associated with lower blood glucose and cholesterol but higher blood pressure and resting heart rate, though magnitude of all associations were very small. Adjusting for BMI and resting heart rate attenuated associations, though they remained consistent with findings from the ecological analysis. Physical activity is favourably associated with lipid and glucose metabolism and domain-specific differences are very small.Disclosures:Abdulwahab Alshallal was supported by the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of the Sciences.

Local authorities in England are not mandated to commission weight management services to support people living with obesity and there is a lack of recent national government policy. This has resulted in a multitude of different approaches being implemented to address obesity within local authorities. This study collated information on what approaches and services are available and commissioned across the North East and Yorkshire regions of England. The aim of this study was to explore and understand what approaches are used in local authorities in the North East and Yorkshire region to address obesity. This qualitative study included two stages of data collection. 1) The researcher conducted surface level mapping through participating in community network meetings attended by local authority public health obesity leads and facilitated by Office for Health Improvement and Disparities regional leads. 2) Conducted thirty-minute semi-structured interviews with local authority public health obesity leads (n = 21) to give a greater insight into chosen approaches within each area. North East and Yorkshire local authorities are broadly focussing on three approaches; whole systems, delivering or commissioning NICE guidance advised weight management services and weight neutral/compassionate approaches. Findings indicate that there is a shift from delivering weight centric services to patient led weight management services. It is recognised that gaps in missing pathways, limited senior leadership support, lack of support as weight management remains outside mandated service requirements, and a dearth of national guidance are contributing factors to disparities in approaches adopted. This study has mapped in detail the different approaches taken between local authorities in the North East and Yorkshire region. This has been shared with local authorities and policy communities. The study will contribute to recommendations for developing local authority obesity strategies in the future.Disclosures:None. Lucy Marquis1*, Nicola Birch11Midlands Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, Stafford, UKThe Chartered Society of Physiotherapy proposes that physiotherapists are well placed to contribute to obesity assessment, care and treatment. However, evidence suggests that tensions exist between motivation, capability and action in physiotherapists outside of specialist obesity services. This National Health Service (NHS) service improvement project was precipitated by a musculoskeletal (MSK) physiotherapy service clinical audit and training needs analysis that identified gaps in best practice, knowledge, skills and confidence relating to weight management. An audit identified that only 15% of eligible patients were offered weight management support, contrary to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) osteoarthritis guidance recommendations. Lack of knowledge, resources, confidence and time were cited as barriers to implementation. A tailored education intervention was proposed aiming to promote transformative learning (changes in perception and action) and factors that enhance practice (capability, motivation, opportunity) in MSK Physiotherapists. This aligns with international multidisciplinary agreement on the need for transformational change in overweight/obesity education and collective action to establish effective interventions that improve health outcomes for people living with both MSK disorders and obesity. The long-term vision for this project therefore was to facilitate the advancement of care quality and access to obesity treatment within MSK services. A programme theory was developed, informed by realist methodology. A participatory, transformative learning approach was employed throughout development. Intervention delivery was guided by the NHS Change model framework. Evaluation was continuous and informed the refinement of the programme theory with the aim of establishing an effective education intervention to positively change practice and care quality in relation to overweight and obesity nationally. A novel education intervention was identified, developed and tested with physiotherapists (n = 111) within an NHS community MSK service as part of usual continuous professional development protected time. Results of the first iteration suggest that this education package was valued and participants demonstrated positive changes in self-reported knowledge, confidence, skills and perceptions. Participants reported ongoing conflict with navigating their local health system to effectively connect patients with appropriate care and treatment. Role identity, time and resources remain likely barriers to behaviour change in practice.Disclosures:None Louis Talay1,2*, Gerónimo Petrel3, Amit Tiroshi11Eucalyptus, Sydney, Australia,2University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia,3University of Technology, Sydney, Sydney, AustraliaTelehealth has expanded access to obesity care, yet data on the safety and effectiveness of digital weight-loss services (DWLS) combining lifestyle and pharmacological therapy remain limited. This study retrospectively assessed the safety and effectiveness of the Juniper UK weight loss program, a medicated DWLS offering combined lifestyle and pharmacotherapy for people with overweight and obesity. Data was extracted from Eucalyptus’ electronic records for patients initiating Semaglutide-supported treatment between January 1, 2023, and May 1, 2025. Exclusion criteria included discontinuing the program before six medication orders, receiving more than 15 orders, pausing treatment for over three months, or failing to submit weight data within a 12-month window (341–379 days post-initiation). Of 11,162 patients, 2499 met the inclusion criteria (77.6% dropout rate). The mean %WL for this group was 15.2%, with 90.8% achieving clinically significant weight loss (≥5%) and 73.5% losing ≥10%. 1773 patients reported at least one side effect, and 18 experienced severe adverse events. A limitation of the study was that over 80 percent of patients were women of Caucasian ethnicity. In conclusion, despite these limitations and the high prevalence of mild adverse events, the Juniper UK program demonstrated substantial weight loss for adherent patients, with a high proportion achieving clinically significant weight reduction. These findings, combined with the fact that program cost was a major factor in discontinuation and pause decisions, highlight the need for strategies to improve accessibility, address cost barriers, and ensure equitable effectiveness of medicated DWLS across diverse populations. Further research should investigate strategies to enhance long-term adherence and safety, and examine the impact of different cost structures on program accessibility and reach.Disclosures:LT and AT are paid employees at Eucalyptus/Juniper Sue Kenneally11Boots Digital Health, Islington, UKWeight loss medications, particularly GLP-1 agonist medications, are relatively new. While they are safe and effective when prescribed appropriately, there are potential side effects and an associated risk of hospitalisation in a minority of patients. Identifying risk factors for hospitalisation could inform practice and policy, leading to improved prescribing and a reduction in hospitalisation of patients taking weight loss medication. From 1st January 2024 to 31st December 2024, 102364 patients received prescriptions for weight loss medication from our service, including orlistat, injectable semaglutide and injectable tirzepatide. We performed a retrospective analysis of all reported hospitalisations in that time to identify reasons for hospitalisation, related comorbidities and prescription medications reported by the patients involved. These cases were then analysed to identify trends and potentially modifiable predictive factors, or factors where a change in prescribing policy could prevent future hospitalisation. Of 102364 patients receiving treatment in a 12 month period, 75 were hospitalised. Reasons for admissions (number of patients) were: vomiting (17), abdominal pain (12), cholecystectomy (9), constipation (9), diarrhoea (9), pancreatitis (8), cholecystitis (7), diverticulitis (5), gastroenteritis (4), nausea (4) and various, less common indications. The most common comorbidities(n) were depression/anxiety (26), none (22), hypertension (12), asthma (6). The most common medications taken alongside weight loss medication (n) were none (21), antidepressant (20), antihypertensive (12), hormone replacement therapy (10). Hospitalisation was more common in women aged over 46 years. Prescriptions were for semaglutide (n = 35), tirzepatide (n = 39), orlistat (n = 1). These data broadly represent our cohort and do not appear to be risk factors for hospitalisation. Hospitalisation was most common in the first three months of treatment, and therefore was more strongly associated with lower doses of the relevant drugs, in line with standard dose titration protocols. Those who were hospitalised tended to have experienced greater weight loss (>5 kg in total) than their peers. Rapid weight loss in the early stages of treatment with GLP-1 medication is associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation, often with potentially treatable side effects. Identifying rapid responders to medication, slowing their dose titration and effective management of side effects may reduce hospitalisations.Disclosures:SK has received honoraria previously from Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Oviva.

Family involvement and support could potentially improve the effectiveness of weight loss interventions for mothers with overweight or obesity however the comparative efficacy of a family based versus a non-family based or an individual based intervention for mothers is not known. We have performed a systematic review of randomised control trials prospectively registered on Prospero (CRD42024537118) to assess maternal weight and behavioural outcomes. Eligible studies have compared family-based interventions involving children alongside mothers with non-family based or control interventions targeting adult women with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 (≥ 23 kg/m2 for high-risk ethnic groups). Searches were run during April 2024 on Embase, PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO without language restrictions. We have screened approximately 2690 records ultimately including 40 RCTs comprising ~7423 parents (>80% mothers) with interventions ranging from 6 weeks to 5 years with minimum follow up 6 months. We have assessed the risk of bias using ROB2 tool. Preliminary results for the risk of bias shows that around 45% classed as low risk, 35% had some concerns and 20% were high risk. Primary outcomes are changes in maternal weight or BMI. Secondary outcomes include dietary intake and physical activity measures for the mother, other family members, including children’s weight change. Data extractions and RoB2 assessment have been completed. Full synthesis with random effect meta-analysis using weighed mean differences is planned if heterogeneity ≤50%. Planned subgroup analysis will explore factors like the impact of baseline BMI, spousal involvement, intervention duration and analytic approach (intention to treat versus completers). Findings will showcase the value of involving the whole family for maternal weight management and to help shape future intervention design and public health strategies.

While a 5% reduction in body weight is widely regarded as the traditional threshold for achieving clinically meaningful outcomes, the benefits of low-level weight loss (less than 5%) remain unclear. Recent evidence from our systematic review assessed health outcomes associated with low-level weight loss, analysing 70 studies and including data from over 18,200 participants. Studies included participants aged 35 to 78, evaluating 137 health outcomes across cardiometabolic, anthropometric, psychosocial, and well-being measures. Overall, 87% of participants experienced improvements in health measures, 13% reported no change or mixed results, and less than 1% experienced adverse outcomes. These findings challenge the commonly used 5% threshold, suggesting even low-level weight loss can contribute to meaningful health improvements. To contextualise our findings, a Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) session was held with members of the Obesity Voices Hub. Their lived experiences provided critical insights into how weight loss targets are experienced in real life. Participants emphasised that the 5% threshold, while clinically useful, can be discouraging and lead to feelings of failure. Many described the emotional burden of focusing solely on weight, noting that a narrow and non-personalised focus often overshadowed positive behavioural changes and psychological gains. Attendees also highlighted systemic barriers, such as food poverty, mobility limitations, and stigma in healthcare settings, that complicate sustained weight management. Some recounted being asked to “prove” their efforts through photos, receipts, or detailed logs, only to be met with scepticism. These qualitative insights underscore the need for a holistic, sustainable, and person-centred approach to weight management. Participants advocated for strategies that prioritise long-term health and well-being rather than narrow weight metrics. Findings from the systematic review, together with experiences shared by individuals living with obesity, highlight the need to redefine success in weight interventions to reflect a broader range of health outcomes. Adopting a more inclusive and person-centred model could strengthen both the effectiveness and sustainability of weight management efforts.Disclosures:Research relating to this abstract was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) PRP-PRU-02-15 Healthy Weight.

Emma Hunter1,*, Flora Douglas11Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, UKGood health is essential in enabling people to live fulfilling lives, shape communities and drive economic growth, however, health is socially patterned. Low socioeconomic status is associated with an increased risk of non-communicable diseases. Poor dietary patterns and diet related obesity are likely contributors. Less healthy foods, often high in fat, salt and sugar, generally cheaper than healthier alternatives, can become a sensible economic choice for those on a low income. However, repeated consumption can present a challenge for weight management. Most food purchased to be consumed at home is acquired from supermarkets. Any increase in food prices disproportionately impacts low income households. This study explores factors that help and hinder people living with obesity (PLWO) and food insecurity (FI) to purchase healthy, sustainable food from the supermarket. Semi structured interviews and focus groups were conducted in 2023 with adults, living in Scotland and England, who self-identified as LWO and FI (n = 32). Using thematic analysis, six main themes were generated 1) Supermarket deals; perceptions surrounding the good, the bad and the ugly side of supermarket offers and promotions, 2) Scepticism about supermarkets and wider food system; questioning supermarket pricing motives but recognising the role of the wider food system in food pricing, 3) Others role enhancing or undermining healthy diet intentions; the impact of others in shaping food purchases, 4) Restrictions facing non-UK nationals; additional challenges faced by those with no recourse to public funds, 5) Overwhelming in-store experience; sensory overload and attempts to prevent impulse purchases, 6) Unconscious sustainable shopping practices; budget-saving strategies that lead to sustainable purchasing patterns and behaviours. Factors identified as helpful in supporting healthy, sustainable food purchases for some were described as hindering this behaviour for others. Scepticism of supermarket pricing strategies may not be unfounded and potentially result in cost saving, albeit effortful, shopping behaviours. Participants agreed on the need for upstream changes, including the requirement of adequate benefits and wages to reduce health inequalities. Although budget-maximising strategies may be seen as environmentally sustainable shopping practices (i.e., buying less meat), they do not mean that a healthy diet is being purchased or consumed.Disclosures:This research was funded through the Transforming the UK Food System for Healthy People and a Healthy Environment SPF Programme, delivered by UKRI, in partnership with the Global Food Security Programme, BBSRC, ESRC, MRC, NERC, Defra, DHSC, OHID, Innovate UK and FSA.

People who are food insecure, often struggle to access nutritious foods consistently, with limited options due to the affordability and availability of healthier, more sustainable choices in their communities. The retail environment plays a pivotal role in influencing food purchasing behaviours, as an antecedent to consumption. While retail communications can shape behaviour, little is known about how their campaigns resonate with people living with obesity and food insecurity. This qualitative study gains insights into the perspectives of people living with obesity and food insecurity responding to two national campaigns: one aimed at easing the burden of rising food prices, and another promoting healthy, sustainable meals. Thirty-nine adults, living in the north of England, who self-reported as living with obesity and food insecurity shared their perspectives on campaign images from a single retailer during four in-person focus groups. Using reflexive thematic analysis, five themes and 12 subthemes were generated from the focus groups. In viewing the images and considering their influence, participants questioned (1) Do I have the resources needed? Food purchasing decisions were influenced by both financial and time resources, (2) Do I know what it means?, Participants did not always understand the images presented, (3) Do I trust it? Participants queried the authenticity of the prices and images illustrated, (4) Do I want it? Participants questioned whether the food illustrated was appealing to them. The final theme (5) Recommendations for Future Promotional Communications resulted from participants emphasising that messaging should apply to them by incorporating ethnically diverse food images that are suitable for a range of health conditions. These insights were presented and discussed with the retail partner in an online participatory workshop, which generated the theme It is a conundrum. The diverse needs of subgroups, including people living with obesity and food insecurity, when developing national campaigns, make it challenging for retailers to communicate healthy, sustainable food promotions. Effectively navigating the complexities of promoting healthy and sustainable foods is crucial for achieving lasting improvements as part of transforming the food system.Disclosures:This research was funded through the Transforming the UK Food System for Healthy People and a Healthy Environment SPF Programme, delivered by UKRI, in partnership with the Global Food Security Programme, BBSRC, ESRC, MRC, NERC, Defra, DHSC, OHID, Innovate UK and FSA (BB/W018020/1 - FIO Food award). Marta Lonnie1,*, Alexandra Johnstone11University of Aberdeen, UKDespite many UK government reports on tackling obesity, the trends for obesity in men and women in the UK, are increasing. However, obesity is disproportionately represented in socially disadvantaged groups, particularly for those living in areas of deprivation, leading to dietary health inequalities. Engaging stakeholders in health research is pivotal for developing and evaluating effective strategies for managing obesity (supporting healthy weight) and reducing food insecurity. By involving diverse groups, such as policymakers, third sector, community organisations, and individuals with lived experience, researchers can ensure that interventions are culturally appropriate, sustainable, and tailored to communities’ specific needs. Furthermore, co-designing decision-making frameworks with food system representatives and consumers can enhance obesity prevention strategies. Lastly, understanding the stakeholders’ motivations and the stages of engagement necessary for successful implementation can lead to more effective and context-specific interventions to improve dietary behaviours. The FIO Food project investigates the relationship between food insecurity and obesity and exemplifies the integration of stakeholder engagement in addressing diet inequalities within the UK food system. The project seeks to create actionable solutions that resonate with target populations by prioritising stakeholder input. Despite the strong encouragement for applying a co-production approach, several challenges have been identified, such as conflicting priorities, resource constraints, power imbalances and sustaining engagement over time. The presented work will share best practice from the FIO Food project as a case study to illustrate the co-production processes, with emphasis on challenges and opportunities of engaging policymakers and the third sector stakeholders.Disclosures:This research was funded through the Transforming the UK Food System for Healthy People and a Healthy Environment SPF Programme, delivered by UKRI, in partnership with the Global Food Security Programme, BBSRC, ESRC, MRC, NERC, Defra, DHSC, OHID, Innovate UK and FSA.

One potential intervention strategy already employed by some retailers is the use of food and beverage (F&B) swaps, where consumers are incentivized or nudged to choose one product over another. Supermarket transaction data is a relatively untapped resource that can be used to explore opportunities for F&B swaps and quantify the potential scale of environmental and health impacts. We used transaction data from a major UK supermarket on >160 million purchases made in 2022 in Yorkshire and the Humber (Y&H) to estimate sustainability metrics (Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGE), Land Use and Water Use) and High in Fat Salt and Sugar (HFSS) status for >28,000 products. Environmental sustainability metrics were estimated from global averages for 43 food commodities. Products were classified into one of 77 categories based on the Living Costs and Food Survey (LCFS) categories, and then into 201 subcategories. Estimated environmental sustainability metrics were calculated for each of the 201 subcategories. Differences in median sustainability metrics (per kg), proportion of HFSS products, and lowest product price (per kg) across subcategories within the same LCFS category were explored to identify potential product swaps that are better for population and planetary health. Data on product sales over a 12-month period were used to estimate the total environmental impact from such swaps. For example, switching from a beef microwave ready meal (MRM) to a vegetarian MRM was estimated to reduce GHGE by 25.3 kg CO2-equivalent per kg on average, while reducing the cost per kg of the cheapest product within each category by 12%, and maintaining the proportion (by weight) of non-HFSS product options at 94%. Replacing 10% of the beef MRM sold to Y&H customers over a year (by weight) with vegetarian MRM products had the following estimated environmental impacts: 7.3% lower GHGE, 7.1% lower Land Use, 1.7% greater Water Use. This work provides insight into possible F&B swaps that could improve population and planetary health without imposing an additional financial burden on the consumer.Disclosures:This work was conducted in partnership with Sainsbury’s PLC, who supplied transaction data for analysis.

Weight stigma refers to the negative attitudes, beliefs, stereotypes, and discriminatory behaviours directed towards individuals based on their body weight or size. It can impact on a person’s physical and mental health, resulting in poor self-esteem, body image and relationship with food, leading to social isolation and decreased trust in people. Only 26% of people with obesity reported being treated with dignity and respect by healthcare professionals when seeking advice or treatment for their obesity. Patient X describes experiencing weight stigma throughout life from health care professions, friends and strangers in the street. Patient X describes feeling talked down to and being refused care by health care professionals due to his weight and receiving derogatory comments whilst attending a gym. Patient X eventually stopped attending, leading to a decline in Patient’s X’s mental health, trust in people and further weight gain. After losing a substantial amount of weight on a previous occasion Patient X underwent an apronectomy which became infected, resulting in scar tissue and overhang of this tissue. This led to reduced mobility and Patient X eventually became house bound. Patient X sought surgery to remove the scar tissue, however, due to the risks he was advised to reduce his Body Mass Index (BMI) < 40. Patient X was referred to the community dietetic department and started the total diet replacement programme for an extended period. His weight was 284 kg, BMI 80.4. Patient X lost 114 kg (40% of his body weight) over 11 months, however mental health issues remain. Patient X is still unable to leave home and still mistrusting of healthcare professionals. This case study illustrates the lasting impact of weight stigma, even when weight loss goals are achieved. Further work is needed to highlight the harm caused by weight stigma.Disclosures:None Fiona Campbell1,*1NHS Grampian, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, UKBariatric surgery compared to traditional weight loss treatments results in better weight maintenance, improvement of obesity related comorbidities, improvement of quality of life and psychological health. Those seeking bariatric surgery can often present with complex psychological history (e.g. depression, eating disorders, personality difficulties and may have encountered a greater number of adverse childhood events such as neglect and trauma compared to the general population). It is recognised that bariatric surgery will lead to significant weight loss and secondary physical health benefits. Many patients will also benefit psychologically from undertaking bariatric surgery but there are many factors which can make adjustment to life after surgery challenging. Despite the many improvements that may include improvement in mood and increased confidence, there will be a subset of patients who continue to struggle with psychological issues after bariatric surgery. Even for patients with no psychological bariatric surgery is a psychologically and emotionally demanding process that involves significant lifestyle and behavioural changes as well as other adjustments. This is against a backdrop where changes particularly in the first year are rapid which can contribute to issues such as brain-body-lag, body image distress, transfer of addiction, return of disordered eating. The vast number of challenges mentioned above that can occur post operatively are as a result of the rapid adjustments that patients are required to make and highlight that early access to psychology support is vital to help patients navigate these initial difficulties. There is great disparity across the UK in terms of psychological support for patient’s undertaking weight loss surgery. NHS Grampian is fortunate to be able to support pre and post- surgery patients psychologically from pre surgery assessment, through education and preparation sessions, offer psychologically informed groups both pre and post-surgery as well as being able to provide induvial support to those most at need. Psychological pre and post-surgical challenges of a case study in the NHS Grampian bariatric service will be presented and what work was undertaken to promote a positive and lasting outcome of weight loss surgery.Disclosures:None Alice McGregor1,*, Kevin Deans11NHS Grampian, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, UKObesity is a risk factor for subfertility. Furthermore, people living with obesity are often unable to access fertility treatment due to having a body mass index above criteria-based cut-offs for accessing treatment. Many people living with obesity seek help with weight management with a view to improving fertility or accessing fertility treatment. After undergoing bariatric surgery, patients are often advised not to become pregnant until they are weight stable, typically around 12 to 18 months after surgery, and to use reliable non-oral contraception meantime. However, factors such as improved fertility after bariatric surgery and continued use of oral contraception (which may be incompletely absorbed) mean that it is not uncommon for people to become pregnant soon after undergoing bariatric surgery. People who are pregnant after undergoing bariatric surgery require pregnancy-appropriate multivitamin and trace element supplementation, specialist nutritional monitoring and close liaison with the obstetric team. This part of the symposium will involve the case presentation of a person who underwent bariatric surgery and subsequently became pregnant. As the case is discussed by the multidisciplinary panel and audience, key aspects of fertility problems and pregnancy in people living with obesity will be discussed with reference to the evidence base and best practice clinical guidance.Disclosures:None Kevin Deans11NHS Grampian, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, UKAn increasing number of people living with obesity are travelling overseas to undergo bariatric surgery. Reasons for this often include limited availability of bariatric surgery within the UK, combined with lengthy waiting lists. People who are considering self-funding bariatric surgery are often drawn to overseas providers due to their lower cost. However, there is significant variation in packages of care provided by overseas services in the context of bariatric and metabolic surgery medical tourism, with a recent survey finding that less than a quarter of centres provide psychological assessment, and less than a third provide dietetic assessment. Follow-up after overseas bariatric surgery has also been found to be variable and often limited. A recent modified Delphi consensus statement from the European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO), IFSO European Chapter (IFSO-EC) and the European Coalition for People living with Obesity (ECPO) made recommendations on safe practice for bariatric and metabolic surgery medical tourism. Recommendations covered areas such as regulation of providers of bariatric surgery, eligibility for bariatric surgery abroad and provision of clinical care including operative care and follow-up. In this part of the symposium, a clinical case history will be discussed which details some of the issues faced by a person living with obesity who underwent bariatric surgery overseas. Panel and audience discussion will focus on reference to the evidence base and best practice clinical guidance, and the panel members will discuss data from their own centre’s experience of providing care for people who experience complications after bariatric and metabolic surgery medical tourism.Disclosures:None Ashley Adamson1,*, Angela Jones1, Mohadeseh Shojaei Shahrokhabadi1, Laura Basterfield1, João Paulo de Aguiar Greca1, Letitia Sermin-Reed1, Maddey Patterson1, Elizabeth Evans2, Vera Araújo-Soares3, Lorraine Mc Sweeney1, Tomos Robinson1, Shaun Hui4, Martin Tovee5, Louisa Ells6, Alison Gahagan7, Dawn Teare1, John Matthews11Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK,2Durham University, Durham, UK,3Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany,4University of Oxford, Oxford, UK,5Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK,6Leeds Beckett University, Leeds, UK,7Department of Health and Social Care, London, UKParents are critical to healthy weight maintenance in their child, but many do not recognise when their child has overweight or obesity. The MapMe intervention was developed to address this and raise awareness of the health consequences of overweight in childhood. MapMe includes visual images of child body shapes of different weight statuses, to help parents understand what a child with overweight or obesity looks like. It also provides web-based information to support parents to take action to prevent or address unhealthy weight gain in their child. The mandated National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) measures the weight status of children aged 4–5 and 10–11 years in England and feedback is shared with parents by letter. This three-arm cluster randomised controlled trial evaluated the effect of incorporating MapMe into the NCMP feedback on child weight outcomes at one year. The three interventions were: Control (Standard NCMP feedback), Intervention 1 (Enhanced NCMP letter including the MapMe website link and a paper copy of the images), Intervention 2 (Intervention 1 plus a ‘booster’ letter including a copy of the images at six months). Ten local authorities (LAs) were randomly allocated to one of three intervention pairs. Within each LA, schools were randomly assigned to one of the two interventions allocated to that LA. 55,088 parents of 4–5 and 10–11 year old children participated. There was no evidence that either intervention had an effect on body mass index (BMI) Z-score change at one year in children with overweight or obesity at baseline. For all children, there was a statistically significant reduction in BMI Z-score for Intervention 1 compared to Control in 4–5 year old children only (adjusted difference = −0.03, 95%CI = (−0.06 to −0.00), p = 0.03). Embedding the MapMe intervention in NCMP feedback did not significantly affect BMI Z-score change at one year in children with overweight or obesity though it could be useful as a population level intervention to support parents in maintaining a healthy weight in their child. This should be part of wider national strategy. Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects of the intervention.Disclosures:LJE receives funding from NIHR, MRC and Nuffield Foundation.

Lorraine McSweeney1,*1Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UKThe National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) measures the weight status of 4–5- and 10–11-year-olds and communicates results to parents, via letter. Parents are sometimes surprised by and mistrust these results. MapMe is a tool to improve parental acknowledgement and understanding of childhood overweight and obesity. Ten English Local Authorities (LAs) agreed to collaborate to test MapMe and deliver the intervention to parents via an ‘enhanced’ NCMP feedback letter including Body Image Scales (BIS): images of NCMP age- and sex-appropriate children of different weight statuses, plus dedicated website with BIS and supportive information. As part of the trial process evaluation, a qualitative study was conducted to determine the acceptability of the intervention, and views of embedding MapMe into usual practice. Twenty-seven parents and 48 LA staff consented to an interview, focus group or online questionnaire. All interviews and focus groups were conducted online and data analysed using thematic Framework analysis. Of the 27 parents interviewed, 25 had received a ‘healthy weight’ feedback letter for their child, one ‘overweight’ and one ‘very overweight’; this limited the range of views available. Parents receiving ‘healthy weight’ feedback letters had no concerns about receiving the letters, did not feel the need to visit the intervention website and reported being happy to receive the BIS included with the letter. Whilst some LA stakeholders described the enhanced letters as too long or not compassionate in tone, no increase in parental complaints were reported. From the small number of complaints received from parents, LA stakeholders did not believe that embedding MapMe in usual NCMP practice would have a negative effect. Overall, it was suggested that MapMe could add value to the NCMP. Based on the very small number of parent complaints, it is unlikely to have a detrimental effect on the programme delivery.Disclosures:None Tomos Robinson1,2, Sedighe Hosseini Jebeli3, João Paulo de Aguiar Greca1, Letitia Sermin-Reed1, Maddey Patterson1, Angela Jones1, Laura Basterfield1,*, Lorraine McSweeney1, Vera Araújo Soares4, Elizabeth Evans5, Alison Gahagan6, Mohadeseh Shojaei Shahrokhabadi1, Martin Tovee7, Ashley Adamson11Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK,2NIHR Applied Research Collaboration North East and North Cumbria, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK,3University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK,4Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany,5Durham University, Durham, UK,6Office for Health Improvement and Disparities, London, UK,7Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UKChildhood obesity is a major health concern and a public health priority. Parents play a key role in addressing childhood obesity, and one possible solution could be directly informing parents about their child’s weight status, encouraging them to change behaviour. The MapMe intervention has been developed as a tool to improve parental acknowledgement and understanding of childhood obesity. As part of the MapMe2 study, a three-arm cluster randomised trial was conducted in England as part of the mandatory National Child Measurement Programme to estimate the impact of two versions of the MapMe intervention on child weight in children aged 4–5 and 10–11 years. The aim of this study was to conduct a within-trial cost-utility analysis (CUA) as part of a sub-study of the MapMe2 trial to estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of two versions of the MapMe intervention compared to a control group. A CUA was carried out from an NHS perspective over a one-year time horizon. In the base case, the primary outcome was child health-related quality of life measured by the CHU-9D. Results were expressed as incremental cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained. Results showed both the ‘Web Only’ and ‘Web Boost’ versions of the MapMe intervention to have a higher probability of being cost-effective compared to the control group, with these results robust to the inclusion of out-of-pocket payments related to child weight management and physical activity made by the parents of the children and the use of a condition-specific measure of HRQoL. However, given the small sample size in the sub-study, the results from this study should be treated with a high degree of caution. Future analysis should focus on estimating the cost-effectiveness of public health interventions such as MapMe over a longer time horizon, given that full costs and benefits are unlikely to be captured in the short time frame of trials such as MapMe2.Disclosures:AJA receives funding from NIHR. Giulia Spaltro1,*, Mr. Michael Whitman1, Rebecca Richards11Second Nature, London, UKEvidence suggests that obesity and psychological distress share a bidirectional relationship, where higher BMI is associated with increased anxiety, depression, and emotional eating. This highlights the need to integrate psychological support into obesity treatment, however, such support remains scarce. Remotely-delivered specialist weight management services (SWMS) can provide psychological support at scale at a lower cost than traditional face-to-face services, however evidence remains limited. This service evaluation explored the preliminary impact of Second Nature’s remotely-delivered SWMS for adults living with obesity on psychological distress, emotional eating and weight change at 4 and 7 months. Participants (N = 39 at 4-months, N = 20 at 7-months) were referred from an NHS SWMS and allocated to: 1) a psychologically-informed app programme, 2) DBT-based group programme, or 3) one-to-one psychological support. Primary outcomes were weight changes; secondary outcomes included psychological distress, emotional eating, quality of life, physical activity, and emotion regulation. At 4-months, weight reduced by an average of −2.2 kg (p = .012), alongside significant decreases in psychological distress (p < .001). At 7-months, total weight loss increased to −4.3 kg (p = .037) with participants in the DBT-based group programme showing the greatest change (−15.7 kg, p = .026). Psychological distress continued decreasing (p < .001), with 80% below clinical threshold at 7-months versus 28.2% at baseline. Improvements in emotional eating (p < .001), emotion regulation (p = .008), physical activity levels (p < .001) and subjective health status (p = .002) were also observed. A remotely-delivered SWWi can achieve significant improvements in psychological distress, emotional eating and weight for adults living with obesity. Integrated approaches addressing both behavioural and psychological factors of obesity may enhance outcomes in clinical practice.Disclosures:GS, RR and MW are employees of Second Nature Healthy Habits Ltd.

GLP-1 outcomes appear promising from a physical health perspective. However, there is limited evidence exploring the impact of GLP-1 use on disordered eating behaviours, of which may be pre-existing or emerge post-treatment initiation. This service evaluation aimed to qualitatively explore the impact of GLP-1 use on eating behaviours. The primary aim of this service evaluation is to explore the relationship between GLP-1 use and eating behaviours, including but not limited to emotional eating, binge-eating, and compensatory behaviours. The secondary aim of this service evaluation is to explore the psychological support patients are currently receiving in relation to their GLP-1 use (NHS or private), any past psychological support they have received, and what additional support, if any, they would find beneficial. Participants (N = 15–20) were purposively sampled from service-specific databases used within Tier 3 and Tier 4 Guys and St Thomas’ NHS Trust (GSTT). Databases indicated whether participants were taking GLP-1s privately or through NHS provision. A quantitative questionnaire was administered to patients’ pre-interview to identify existing difficulties with emotional eating, binge eating and compensatory behaviours. Interviews will take place between April-May 2025, and be analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. This project will address gaps in the literature by identifying key participant experiences surrounding GLP-1 use and eating behaviours that require further investigation and support. The results will be used to inform service provision from a psychological perspective for patients using GLP-1s within the Tier 3 and Tier 4 Specialist Obesity Management Programmes (GSTT).Disclosures:None Open AccessThis article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

    "abstract": "BackgroundInsufficient weight loss or weight regain after metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is frequent, and evidence to support the use of pharmacotherapy for weight management is limited.MethodsIn this single-centre retrospective cohort study, the effectiveness of naltrexone/bupropion (NB) for weight control in surgery-naive and post-MBS patients was evaluated. Data was collected between 2016 and 2022 on all patients started on NB after multidisciplinary consult. Patients received weekly dose escalation up to 32/360 mg daily per the manufacturer’s protocol, with submaximal doses administered in cases of adverse effects or sufficient therapeutic response. Weight evolution, metabolic status, adherence and adverse events were analysed at 4 and 12 months after NB initiation. Data are presented as median (interquartile range).ResultsA total of 151 patients were included, 111 were surgery-naive and 40 with prior MBS. The median time after MBS was 7.1 years (4.2, 14.9). Among the post-MBS patients, 18 (45%) patients had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and 11 (27.5%) sleeve gastrectomy. Four months after initiation of NB, 46.8% of the surgery-naive patients and 67.5% of the post-MBS patients continued using NB, with a median weight loss of 6.4% (3.0, 10.1) and 6.3% (2.3, 12.1) respectively. At 12-months, 38.5% of surgery-naive patients and 63.0% of post-MBS patients had continued NB, with median weight loss of 8.8% (5.0, 16.7) and 10.0% (4.5, 16.5) respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in weight loss between the surgery-naive and post-MBS group. Weight loss was not significantly influenced by whether the maximal dose was reached in both the surgery-naive patients (p= 0.38) and the post-MBS patients (p= 0.72).ConclusionReal-world data show that NB treatment is equally effective in surgery-naive patients and in patients experiencing weight regain after bariatric surgery, regardless of the maximal dose administered.",

    "title": "Local abaloparatide administration promotes in situ alveolar bone augmentation via FAK-mediated periosteal osteogenesis",
    "abstract": "Insufficient alveolar bone thickness increases the risk of periodontal dehiscence and fenestration, especially in orthodontic tooth movement. Abaloparatide (ABL), a synthetic analog of human PTHrP (1–34) and a clinical medication for treating osteoporosis, has recently demonstrated its potential in enhancing craniofacial bone formation. Herein, we show that intraoral submucosal injection of ABL, when combined with mechanical force, promotes in situ alveolar bone thickening. The newly formed bone is primarily located outside the original compact bone, implying its origin from the periosteum. RNA sequencing of the alveolar bone tissue revealed that the focal adhesion (FA) pathway potentially mediates this bioprocess. Local injection of ABL alone enhances cell proliferation, collagen synthesis, and phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in the alveolar periosteum; when ABL is combined with mechanical force, the FAK expression is upregulated, in line with the accomplishment of the ossification. In vitro, ABL enhances proliferation, migration, and FAK phosphorylation in periosteal stem cells. Furthermore, the pro-osteogenic effects of ABL on alveolar bone are entirely blocked when FAK activity is inhibited by a specific inhibitor. In summary, abaloparatide combined with mechanical force promotes alveolar bone formation via FAK-mediated periosteal osteogenesis. Thus, we have introduced a promising therapeutic approach for drug-induced in situ alveolar bone augmentation, which may prevent or repair the detrimental periodontal dehiscence, holding significant potential in dentistry.",

    "title": "Critical thresholds of adult patch density and spacing during coral fertilization",
    "abstract": "Climate change and other anthropogenic stressors have severe impacts on the ecological functioning of marine ecosystems by causing widespread declines in population sizes and, for surviving individuals, limiting the capacity for population recovery through sexual reproduction. Ecological theory suggests that affected populations can suffer local extinction because of Allee effects, where reduced population densities prevent gamete encounters, resulting in reproductive failure. Without understanding the relationship between the density or spacing of spawning individuals and fertilization success, coral reefs may unknowingly pass a critical population threshold, further complicating conservation efforts. In this study we conducted a series of independent manipulative field experiments using three common simultaneous hermaphroditic spawningAcroporaspecies in two locations (One Tree Island, Great Barrier Reef, and Ngermid Bay, Palau) to assess evidence of Allee effects in small populations. Experimental ‘patches’ of corals were structured with mean intercolonial distances ranging from 1 m to 2 m, resulting in low but measurable fertilization success (1.2–8.7%). We developed a mechanistic coral fertilization model and validated its predictions against this empirical data, finding close alignment. Depending on the species and their colony size, the model predicts that adult coral densities need to exceed 13–50 colonies per 100 m2for reefs to ensure 10% fertilization success.",

    "title": "Progressive decline in soil nitrogen stocks with warming in a Tibetan permafrost ecosystem",
    "abstract": "Permafrost regions contain a substantial fraction of Earth’s soil nitrogen, which is vulnerable to climate change. The response of this crucial N stock to warming could impact the permafrost–climate feedback by altering plant productivity, microbial decomposition and nitrous oxide emissions. However, the long-term trajectory of soil N stocks in response to warming remains unclear. Here we present results from a ten-year field warming experiment in a permafrost ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau. We made repeated measurements of soil N stocks to 50 cm depth and assessed 28 N-cycling variables to explore three primary pathways affecting soil N stocks, including N inputs, microbial N transformations and N losses. Our results reveal that, despite no changes being observed during the initial years of the experiment, warmed plots experienced a decline in surface soil N stocks (an average 7.7% reduction relative to control plots) after eight years of warming. This decrease is associated with the enhanced N sequestration in perennial plant biomass, increased ecosystem N leaching and gaseous N losses from soils. Our findings underscore the vulnerability of soil N stocks in permafrost regions to ongoing warming, and suggest that the potential permafrost–climate feedback may be stronger than previously anticipated.",

    "abstract": "Smoking cessation is the only evidence-based approach to reducing tobacco-related health risks, yet traditional interventions suffer from limited coverage. Although digital interventions show promise, their comparative efficacy across methodological frameworks and technology types remains unclear. Here we assessed digital interventions versus standard care via frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis of 152 randomized controlled trials (48.8% USA, 7.5% China). Interventions were categorized by methodology and technology type, with cross-matched subgroup analyses. Results showed that personalized interventions significantly improved smoking cessation rates compared with standard care (relative risk (RR) 1.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54–2.24), while group-customized interventions were more effective (RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.30–2.86) compared with standard digital interventions (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.31–1.72). Among the various technology types, text message-based interventions were the most effective (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.38–1.92). Intervention effectiveness was also influenced by age, with middle-aged individuals benefitting more than younger individuals. Short- and medium-term interventions were more effective than long-term interventions. Sensitivity analyses further confirmed these low-to-moderate findings. However, this study has some limitations, including methodological heterogeneity, potential bias and inconsistent definitions of numerical interventions. In addition, long-term follow-up data remain limited. Future studies require large-scale trials to assess long-term sustainability and population-specific responses, as well as standardization of methods and integration of data at the individual level.",

    "abstract": "B cell-rich tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are associated with favorable prognosis and positive response to immunotherapy in cancer. Here we show that simultaneous activation of innate immune effectors, STING and lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR), results in CD8+T cell-dependent tumor suppression while inducing high endothelial venule development and germinal center-like B cell responses in tumors to generate functional TLS in a T cell-dependent manner. In a neoadjuvant setting, activation of STING and LTβR by their agonists effectively immunized mice against tumor recurrence, leading to long-term survival. STING activation alone was insufficient for inducing B cell-containing TLS or eliciting long-term therapeutic effects. However, when combined with LTβR activation, it improved the fitness of TLS with B cell expansion and maturation to IgG-producing long-lived plasma cells and memory cells, increased CD4+T cell recruitment and memory CD8+T cell expansion, and shifted the TH2/TH17 balance, resulting in the potentiation of humoral and cellular immunity against tumors. These findings suggest a therapeutic approach of simultaneously activating STING and lymphotoxin pathways.",

    "title": "The expanding world of topological ferroelectrics",
    "abstract": "In this issue we present three papers on the topological properties or structure of ferroelectrics, which are interlinked. Topology is the branch of mathematics concerned with the continuous deformation of geometries, one of the main conclusions of which is that geometries cannot be distorted arbitrarily into any shape; that is, certain structures are topologically invariant. This may seem like a far cry from materials science, but science has a way of connecting fields as seemingly widely separated as nuclear physics and magnetism. Consider the magnetic skyrmion, so-called because its particle-like and chiral spin structures are topologically protected and cannot be deformed into bulk ferromagnetic phases. This is analogous to solutions to a nonlinear field theory by Tony Skyrme of interacting pions that resulted in stable particles1. These magnetic skyrmions were first observed in 2009, and have potential for high-density information storage. It was almost a decade later before skyrmions (pictured) and similar topological structures were observed in another ferroic; ferroelectrics that possess permanent polarization and history-dependent switching behaviour under electric field2,3. Complex heterostructures or nanostructures are required to balance competing energetics to stabilize topological structures, potentially limiting experimental accessibility and applications of these systems.Figure adapted from ref.4, Springer Nature Limited. In anArticleby Zheng Wen and colleagues an alternative approach for the formation of skyrmion domains is presented. The authors compose solid-solution alloys of ferroelectric PbTiO3and an antiferroelectric PbSnO3, PbHfO3or PbZrO3, where an antiferroelectric can be considered as a material with no overall polarization due to antiparallel polarizations within its unit cell. As there are differences in the polar axis orientation between ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics, non-collinear orientations form that enable polarization rotation and so give rise to topological textures. These are observed using vector piezoresponse force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), while effective Hamiltonian simulations corroborate experimental results and show topological charge is equal to that of skyrmions. A full phase map for all alloys is presented, and electrical writing–erasure of skyrmions demonstrated. As Petro Maksymovych discusses in the accompanyingNews & Views article, this alloying approach may lead to rapid and scalable optimization, and notes this could enable platforms for the study of non-collinear textures. It is the interaction between ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics that drives skyrmion formation in the solid-solution alloys, but can antiferroelectrics themselves display topological textures such as skyrmions, or their two-dimensional equivalent vortices? A driving force for polarization rotation in ferroelectrics is the depolarization field at an interface; however, in antiferroelectrics this field does not occur. In aLetterby Gustau Catalan and colleagues, vortices and antivortices are observed using STEM in the prototypical antiferroelectric PbZrO3. Analysis of the STEM data, in combination with second-principles simulations, show these topological objects form at ferroelastic domain walls. Ferroelastics are another class of ferroic, classified as materials that possess spontaneous strain. In PbZrO3, there are six ferroelastic domain orientations and the interaction between local polarization and the ferroelastic domain wall between ferroelastic domains drives topological texture formation. Vortices manifest when the domain wall is head-to-tail (in terms of Pb displacement that generates polarity), and antivortices when the domain wall is head-to-head or tail-to-tail. Polarization in perovskite ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics is structural, relating to the displacement of the cation in the unit cell. In anArticleby David Muller and colleagues, a polarization driven by anion displacements is reported. Thin films of NaNbO3are grown on a DyScO3substrate and under epitaxial tensile strain generate ferroelectricity. Using multislice electron ptychography that enables the imaging of atoms throughout the film, they image the metal cations and the oxygen anions in their sample. The oxygen octahedra present large rotations while the cation displacements are minimal. Moreover, density functional theory calculations indicate that several competing phases with similar energies can coexist, indicating a complex energy landscape. In the accompanyingNews & Views articleby Xiaoyue Gao and Peng Gao, the authors suggest that manipulating the oxygen configuration under an external field could tune material properties, and that quantifying polarization solely through cation displacements could be inadequate for full characterization. This could also be the case for identifying topological objects. Commercial applications of ferroelectrics have existed for decades. The study of topological texture in ferroelectrics is still in its infancy, and commercialization is likely a long time away. It is interesting to see if and how topological objects enable materials properties beyond the state of the art, for example with improved dielectric properties4, as well as how these objects can advance fundamental studies. Further studies on the dynamics of these objects are welcome. The development and study of these systems certainly relies on the dovetailing of advances in growth, characterization and modelling that epitomizes the multidisciplinarity of materials science.

    "title": "Targeting dormant tumor cells to prevent recurrent breast cancer: a randomized phase 2 trial",
    "abstract": "Breast cancer recurrence may arise from dormant disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) that persist in bone marrow and other sites. Clinically, DTCs are independently associated with breast cancer recurrence and death. Preclinical studies in mouse models identified autophagy and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling as critical mechanisms of tumor dormancy and escape. We subsequently tested the effects of transient versus chronic inhibition of autophagy with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and mTOR signaling with rapamycin (RAPA) or everolimus (EVE) on residual tumor cell (RTC) burden and recurrence-free survival (RFS). In mice harboring dormant RTCs, inhibition of mTOR alone or in combination with autophagy inhibition decreased RTC burden and improved RFS in a duration-dependent manner. RTC number was strongly and inversely correlated with RFS, suggesting that RTC reduction mediated an improvement in RFS. To translate findings clinically, we performed a randomized phase 2 trial (CLEVER) of HCQ, EVE or their combination in breast cancer survivors within 5 years of diagnosis who had detectable DTCs on bone marrow aspirate. Primary endpoints were feasibility and safety; secondary endpoints included DTC reduction/clearance and RFS. In total, 51 DTC+patients initiated HCQ (n= 15), EVE (n= 15) or HCQ + EVE (n= 21). Treatment was feasible and tolerable; only one patient discontinued early for grade 3 toxicity. At 42 months median follow-up, landmark 3-year RFS for HCQ, EVE and HCQ + EVE was 91.7%, 92.9% and 100%, respectively, and was greater in those who cleared DTCs versus those who did not (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.21 (95% confidence interval 0.01–3.4)). Posterior probabilities were 98–99.9% that three cycles of HCQ, EVE or HCQ + EVE led to reduced or undetectable DTCs compared to observation alone, with estimated DTC reductions of 80%, 78% and 87%, respectively. These findings provide proof-of-concept that targeting dormant RTCs with HCQ, EVE or their combination in breast cancer survivors or mouse models depletes minimal residual disease, warranting a definitive human randomized controlled trial.

    "abstract": "Meiotic crossovers, which exchange DNA between homologous chromosomes, are vital for accurate segregation and generate genetic diversity. In plant breeding, they help create new haplotypes by combining beneficial alleles. InArabidopsis, heterozygous regions in an otherwise homozygous background attract more crossovers than in full F1hybrids—a phenomenon so far observed only in this self-fertilizing species. Here we report a similar effect in outcrossing maize: local crossover rates increase up to threefold in regions where polymorphism is spatially confined compared to full hybrids. This stimulation occurs in both male and female meiosis and is strongest when heterozygous regions fully span the measured area, likely due to crossover redistribution. AsArabidopsisand maize represent distantly related plant lineages (eudicots and monocots), this shared phenomenon suggests a conserved mechanism. Importantly, it provides a tool for breeding, offering a way to boost recombination and accelerate the introgression of desired traits using interhomologue polymorphism.",

CAX1 inArabidopsis thaliana(AtCAX1) serves as a Ca2+/H+exchanger transporting excess cytosolic Ca2+into the vacuole, which is modulated by kinase phosphorylation in response to diverse signals. However, the regulatory mechanism remains unclear. Here we present the structures of wild-type AtCAX1 in an inactivated state and a phosphomimetic mutant in an activated state. In the wild-type structure, the amino-terminal region forms an α-helix that blocks the transport tunnel, thus inhibiting its transport activity. In contrast, in the phosphomimetic mutant structure, this blocking helix is released from the tunnel, leading to AtCAX1 activation. Conformational changes are also observed in the transmembrane domain. Together, these findings provide insights into the transport mechanism of the Ca2+/H+exchangers and set up a basis for future studies of the regulation of calcium homeostasis in plants.",

Here we assess the global risks of plastic ingestion, entanglement, pollutant adsorption (methylmercury, MeHg; perfluorooctane sulfonate, PFOS) and additive leaching (bisphenol A; phthalate esters) by integrating a marine plastic model and multisize marine organism data, as well as MeHg and PFOS datasets. Our analysis reveals that ingestion risks vary with the body size of organisms, and are influenced by both biomass distribution and plastic concentration patterns. Entanglement hotspots align with regions of flourishing coastal fisheries, highlighting a substantial threat to marine species. Ingestion risks and toxicity from leached additives are concentrated in the mid-latitude North Pacific Ocean, mid-latitude Atlantic Ocean and northern Indian Ocean. Plastics exhibit high adsorption of PFOS in the North Atlantic and East and Southeast Asian coasts (0.1–0.3 pg m−2) and of MeHg in the northern Indian and southwestern Atlantic oceans (1–18 pg m−2). Using future emission scenarios, we project plastic concentrations and estimate reduced risks under emission control strategies.

The helical backbones and phosphonic acid anchoring groups enable the formation of highly ordered monolayers at the perovskite interface. Notably, the enantiomers of A7HPA stack in a ‘gear mesh’ alternating pattern, strengthening π–π interactions and imparting rigidity to the interfacial layer. This assembly mode distinguishes helical chiral SAMs from conventional carbazole analogues and provides a pathway to enhanced thermal and photostability.The synthetic strategy allows modular tuning of the aza-helicane framework, and the resulting SAMs are characterized through spectroscopic and microscopic methods to confirm monolayer quality and orientation. Devices fabricated with A7HPA (pictured) as the interfacial layer deliver a certified power conversion efficiency of 32.57%, which is among the highest reported values for SAM-based tandem solar cells. Moreover, the devices retain high performance under damp-heat and light-thermal stress tests, emphasizing the contribution of chiral stacking to operational stability.",

Here we report visible-light-induced single-stepmeta-selective radical bromination and chlorination of pyridines using commercial reagents. We show how the key intermediates—pyridinium radical cations, with their tendency to undergo radical coupling—overcome the reluctant halogenation reactivity of pyridines, which differs conceptually from previous umpolung temporary dearomatization strategies. Simultaneously, the spin density distribution on pyridinium radical cations, combined with the suggested π–π stacked structure of intermediates, controls themeta-selective reaction with halogen radicals. These simple, mild and robust reaction conditions distinguish this transformation from other reportedmeta-selective halogenation reactions.",

    "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are pervasively present in human cancers and have a fundamental role in treatment failure and disease recurrence. Identifying critical elements that sustain the CSC phenotype may lead to novel strategies for cancer treatment. Here, we provide evidence of an essential link between the σ1receptor (σ1R), a ligand-regulated chaperone protein residing preferentially at the endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites, and CSCs in castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPCs). Integrating functional assays in multiple preclinical models with transcriptomic and proteomic data, we found that σ1R controls CSC self-renewal capacity and tumorigenic proficiency by coordinating mitochondrial dynamics and mitochondrial-nuclear signaling. Inhibiting σ1R with synthetic antagonists and RNA interference led to the progressive exhaustion and loss of tumorigenicity of the CSC progeny. Mechanistically, interfering with σ1R function disrupted mitochondria homeostasis and triggered β-catenin degradation. Examining clinical CRPC samples, we found a tight correlation between σ1R and mitochondrial gene expression. Furthermore, σ1R and β-catenin protein levels were highly correlated in prostate tumors with significant upregulation in metastatic CRPCs, sustaining a role of the σ1R-mitochondria-β-catenin axis in disease progression. This σ1R-centered axis is essential for preserving the self-renewal and tumorigenic capability of CSCs and represents a critical vulnerability exploitable for discovering novel CSC-directed therapies.",

Lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were collected at 3, 7, and 14 days post-exposure to air or hyperoxia. Hyperoxia-induced effects on lung development were assessed using haematoxylin and eosin staining. IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β levels in BALF were measured by ELISA. Expression of the ACE/AngII/AT1R and ACE-2/Ang(1-7)/Mas axes was analysed via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry.ResultsHyperoxia-induced BPD rats exhibited abnormal alveolar structure, characterized by simplified architecture, thickened septa, and a dysregulated renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Liraglutide significantly reduced hyperoxia-induced levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in BALF and improved alveolar architecture. Moreover, when comparing the BPD group with the BPD+Lira+A779 group, the BPD+Lira group showed a notable decrease in relative mRNA expression of ACE, AngII, and AT1R (P< 0.05), while mRNA levels of ACE-2 and Ang1 increased significantly (P< 0.05). Consistent with RT-PCR findings, western blot analysis demonstrated that, in the BPD+Lira group, protein levels of ACE and AngII in the lung tissue of neonatal rats significantly lower in the BPD + Liraglutide group at postnatal days 3, 7, and 14 compared to both the BPD and BPD+Liraglutide+A779 groups. Conversely, ACE-2 and Ang(1-7) protein concentrations were markedly elevated. These results suggested that liraglutide may protect against hyperoxia-induced neonatal BPD by suppressing the ACE/AngII/AT1R axis and activating ACE-2/Ang(1-7)/Mas axis, an effect antagonized by A779.ConclusionsThese findings elucidated a mechanism whereby GLP-1 mitigated hyperoxia-induced BPD through inhibition of the ACE/AngII/AT1R pathway and activation of the ACE-2/Ang(1-7)/Mas axis.ImpactLiraglutide is capable to protect against hyperoxia-induced neonatal BPD in vitro.Liraglutide mitigated hyperoxia-induced BPD through inhibition of ACE/AngII/AT1R and activation of the ACE-2/Ang(1-7)/Mas axis.The ACE/AngII/AT1R and ACE-2/Ang(1-7)/Mas pathways could be one of those novel mechanisms for treating BPD.",

Investigation into the species’ evolutionary history has revealed phenotypic changes triggered by glaciation-induced range expansion, but understanding the genetic basis of this trait variation has been hampered by the lack of a reference genome. To address this, we assembled a chromosome-level genome ofHyla sardausing PacBio HiFi long reads, Bionano optical maps, and Hi-C data. The assembly comprises 13 assembled chromosomes, spanning a total length of 4.15 Gb with a scaffold N50 of 385 Mb, a BUSCO completeness of 94.60%, and ak-mer completeness of 98.30%. Approximately 75% of the genome consists of repetitive elements. We annotated 22,847 protein-coding genes with a BUSCO completeness of 94.60% and an OMArk completeness of 93.74%. This high-quality assembly provides a valuable resource for studying phenotypic evolution and its genomic basis during range expansion, and will assist future investigations into the population and conservation genomics ofHyla sarda.",

Gaining insights into the trends of chest trauma is crucial in tackling its significant role in causing injuries and fatalities, particularly in low- and middle-income nations. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of chest trauma, the types of injuries, mechanisms of injury, and predictors of mortality in the largest level one trauma center in southern Iran. This retrospective study included 4257 patients who were admitted to a tertiary medical center in southern Iran with chest trauma as the primary diagnosis from March 2019 to March 2022. All patients were divided into survived (n = 3505) and deceased (n = 752) groups. Data were analyzed by IBM SPSS statistics version 26, using independent samples t-test, Chi-Square test, and multivariate logistic regression. The mean age was 37 ± 16.1 and 50.15 ± 21.5 in survived group and deceased group, respectively. Most of the population were men in both groups. The mean of the injury severity score (ISS) was higher in the deceased group (37.22 ± 25.32) than in the survived group (15 ± 10.4). All on-arrival vital signs show significant differences between the two groups. Among various types of thoracic injuries, pneumothorax (OR 2.04, CI 1.52–2.73,P= 0.001) and rib fracture (OR 1.34, CI 1.00–1.79,P= 0.04) increases the odds of mortality. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, gender, ISS, types of thoracic injury, and some on-arrival vital signs are proper mortality predictors in patients with chest wall injury. Multiple risk factors including age, gender, ISS, type of injury, and on-arrival vital signs have been indicated for predicting mortality in chest trauma patients. Proper care and immediate management of these risk factors could lower the mortality morbidity among these patients.",

Clinical outcomes, including pain intensity (Verbal Numerical Rating Scale), functional outcomes (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score [KOOS]), rescue medication consumption, and patient satisfaction, were assessed at baseline, 2, 6, and 12 weeks. Baseline demographic characteristics were comparable between the collagen and placebo groups. Both groups showed significant improvements in pain intensity (p< 0.001) and KOOS scores over time. However, no significant differences were observed between the groups in terms of pain intensity, functional outcomes, rescue medication consumption, or patient satisfaction (p> 0.05). No adverse effects were reported in either group.

    "title": "“Good” fats, bad news: HDL-delivered vitamin E shields tumors from ferroptosis",
    "abstract": "In a recent study published inNature, Calhoon et al.1reported that glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-mediated uptake of lipoproteins protects cancer cells from ferroptosis by delivering α-tocopherol, the most abundant form of vitamin E. This discovery offers potential therapeutic opportunities to either target GAG-dependent lipid uptake or modulate dietary vitamin E to enhance ferroptosis-based cancer therapies. Dynamic reprogramming of cellular metabolic pathways is a hallmark of cancer. Among these, cancer cells actively exploit a diverse range of lipid species, not only as essential biosynthetic precursors (e.g., membrane lipids) and metabolic fuels, but also for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. While tumors benefit from such metabolic rewiring, their unique metabolic snapshot offers attractive opportunities for cancer-targeted approaches. One notable case is ferroptosis, an iron-dependent, regulated cell death triggered by lipid peroxidation, particularly within polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-enriched phospholipids, whose synthesis relies on exogenous essential fatty acids.2,3Although cancer cells satisfy lipid demands via both de novo synthesis and extracellular lipid uptake, how these complex metabolic inputs impact ferroptosis sensitivity remains elusive. To investigate this, Calhoon et al. focused on lipoproteins, key carriers of circulating lipids that facilitate lipid uptake through receptor-mediated mechanisms. A pooled CRISPR screen targeting 200 metabolism-related genes in HeLa cells revealed that glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), a crucial ferroptosis suppressor, was selectively essential in lipoprotein-depleted environments, leading to the hypothesis that lipoproteins may confer protection against ferroptosis. Supporting this idea, supplementation with either high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) restored the viability of GPX4-deficient cells, albeit with HDL offering greater protection. They also showed that the protective capacity is independent of cholesterol content. To determine whether this effect is attributed to direct modulation of lipid peroxidation, the authors employed the fluorescence-enabled inhibited autoxidation (FENIX) assay, which quantifies liposomal membrane peroxidation. Notably, lipoproteins in which native core lipids were replaced with tristearin, a neutral triglyceride composed of three stearate (C18:0) chains, displayed an ablated activity, indicating native core lipids as an essential component for the lipid peroxidation-suppressive activity of lipoproteins. The authors next examined candidate lipid metabolites that might exert HDL’s protective effect, focusing on those known for their anti-ferroptotic properties. These include α-tocopherol (vitamin E), vitamin K2, and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), which act as radical-trapping antioxidants, and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), which reduce membrane susceptibility to peroxidation by competing with PUFAs. To this end, they first disrupted two key enzymes: long-chain-fatty-acid–CoA ligase 3 (ACSL3), which facilitates MUFA incorporation into membrane phospholipids, and apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondria-associated 2 (AIFM2, also known as ferroptosis suppressor protein 1, FSP1), which regenerates the antioxidant forms of CoQ10 and vitamin K2. Interestingly, HDL retained its lipid peroxidation- and ferroptosis-suppressive activity in both ACSL3- and FSP1-deficient cells, ruling out those pathways. Notably, untargeted lipidomics identified that α-tocopherol, the most abundant vitamin E species within HDL, is responsible for HDL’s superior anti-ferroptotic activity (Fig.1). Plasma from vitamin E-deficient mice, but not mice fed a control diet, failed to protect GPX4-deficient cancer cells from ferroptosis, and in tumor xenograft models, cancer cells implanted into vitamin E-deficient mice exhibited slower growth than those in control animals. These results suggest that dietary vitamin E promotes tumor growth by protecting cells from ferroptotic stress.Fig. 1Sulfated GAG-mediated HDL uptake delivers α-tocopherol and suppresses ferroptosis in cancer cells. HDL’s high α-tocopherol content directly inhibits lipid peroxidation both in vitro and in vivo, thereby suppressing ferroptosis and fostering tumor growth. A CRISPR screen identified genes essential for HDL uptake and ferroptosis suppression, includingUGDH, which is involved in GAG chain synthesis, andUGDH,UXS1,XYLT2, andB4GALT7, which mediate proteoglycan linker assembly. These genes contribute to the biosynthesis of sulfated GAG chains such as chondroitin sulfate (CS) and heparan sulfate (HS), together with sulfation-related genes such asPAPSS1andSLC35B2. All genes highlighted in blue were identified from the CRISPR screen. The positively charged apolipoproteins on HDL interact with the negatively charged sulfate groups on GAGs, triggering HDL uptake via an unknown mechanism.

Figure was created with BioRender.com (https://BioRender.com/wp21cb5)Full size image Given that dietary vitamin E restriction has limited therapeutic potential in cancers, the authors sought to identify molecular mechanisms underlying vitamin E uptake by cancer cells. To this end, the authors performed two independent CRISPR screens in Karpas299 cells, a lymphoma cell line displaying high lipoprotein uptake: one aimed to identify genes required for resistance to ML210-induced ferroptosis, while the other was conducted to uncover genes involved in lipoprotein uptake. Both screens converged on genes involved in the biosynthesis of sulfated GAGs (cell-surface sulfated glycosaminoglycans), which are long, linear polysaccharides (Fig.1). Loss of these genes impaired the synthesis of heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS), the two most abundant sulfated GAGs, reduced lipoprotein uptake, and sensitized diverse cancer cell lines to ferroptosis. Furthermore, enzymatic degradation of sulfated GAGs with heparinases and chondroitinase diminished HDL and LDL internalization and restored ferroptosis under lipoprotein-supplemented conditions. Therefore, the authors suggest that sulfated GAGs facilitate electrostatic interactions with apolipoproteins, thereby enhancing cell-surface binding and endocytosis of lipoproteins although the precise mechanism remains unclear (Fig.1). In contrast, deletion of canonical lipoprotein receptors such as scavenger receptor class B1 (SCARB1) or LDL receptor-related protein 8 (LRP8) had marginal effects, underscoring the dominant role of GAG-dependent uptake. Further investigation into human clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs), a lipid-rich malignancy, revealed significantly elevated CS levels and increased lipoprotein-derived α-tocopherol compared with normal kidney tissues. Consistent with this, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with genetic depletion or enzymatic degradation of GAGs exhibited reduced LDL uptake and impaired tumor growth, reinforcing GAG biosynthesis as a critical determinant of tumor growth by mitigating lipid oxidative stress. Thus, GAGs provide a key anti-ferroptotic mechanism, offering a potential therapeutic target for unleashing ferroptosis-based cancer therapies. While antioxidants such as vitamin E were once considered protective against cancer, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) paradoxically revealed an increased risk of prostate cancer,4leading to an emerging view that ferroptosis inhibition by dietary antioxidants may underlie such outcomes. In this emerging perspective, the present study provides mechanistic insight into how lipoprotein-derived vitamin E protects cancer cells from ferroptosis. Collectively, this study highlights α-tocopherol as a key lipoprotein-derived antioxidant that protects cancer cells from ferroptosis via GAG-mediated uptake. While α-tocopherol is a key component, lipoproteins may also deliver additional lipid species involved in ferroptotic vulnerability given their diverse composition. Thus, the broader impact of lipoprotein uptake on lipidomic remodeling and ferroptosis sensitivity in cancer warrants further investigation. While targeting extracellular lipid uptake to sensitize cancer cells to ferroptosis induction offers an attractive therapeutic strategy, it remains unclear how the identified mechanisms of sulfated GAGs and lipoprotein uptake influence immune cells within the tumor microenvironment, which are known to significantly impact cancer growth and the efficacy of targeted therapy.5Therefore, a deeper understanding of how sulfated GAGs and lipoprotein uptake affect ferroptosis across different cell types in the tumor milieu may reveal new therapeutic opportunities.

    "title": "Selective recognition memory impairment in mitochondrial hydroxylase Clk1 mutant mice, rescued by antipsychotics",
    "abstract": "Mitochondria are not only the most important organelles in eukaryotic cells that participate in energy metabolism, signal transduction, cell apoptosis and other physiological processes, but also essential regulators of neurodevelopment, neuroplasticity, survival and adult neurogenesis. The mitochondria-localized hydroxylase Clk-1 is involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis. Recent evidence shows that Clk1+/−mutant mice are resistant to morphine- and methamphetamine-induced conditioned place preference. Given the critical role of learning and memory in drug dependence, we herein explored whether and how Clk1 deficiency affected the cognitive processes in mice. We found that mutant Clk1 mice (Clk1+/−) exhibited recognition memory impairment in novel object recognition (NOR) and novel arm recognition (NAR) tests. In addition, we observed in Clk1+/−mutant mice a selective reduction in dendritic spine density in prefrontal cortex (PFC) but not in the hippocampus (HIP). The expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was also decreased in PFC but not in HIP. Furthermore, Clk1+/−mutant mice displayed impairment in the ERK/CREB signaling pathway in PFC that might underlie Clk1+/−mutation-induced changes in BDNF and dendritic morphology. Administration of antipsychotic drugs aripiprazole (0.3 mg·kg−1·d−1, i.p.) or risperidone (1 mg·kg−1·d−1, i.p.) for 7 days fully rescued Clk1 mutation-induced recognition memory deficits. This study provides primary evidence highlighting the role of mitochondrial Clk1 in the regulation of recognition memory and presents an informative model for investigating mitochondrial function in learning and memory.",

    "abstract": "Enteric glial cells (EGCs) play an important role in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) functions as a catalyzing enzyme targeting hydrolyzation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Increased PDE4 activity promotes excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in various immune and epithelial cells, exacerbating immune cell activation and infiltration in inflamed tissues, inhibition of PDE4 has been proven to be an important strategy for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. In this study we investigated the pathological role of PDE4 and the therapeutic effects of a PDE4 inhibitor apremilast in IBS. 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced IBS model was established in mice, the mice were treated with apremilast (50 mg/kg, i.g.) for 7 days. After treatment, the intestinal motility and visceral sensitivity were assessed. At the end of the study, the mice were euthanized and the blood and colon tissues were collected for analyses. We showed that apremilast treatment significantly ameliorated IBS symptoms in the mice, evidenced by improvement on delayed intestinal motility and visceral hypersensitivity. We found that EGCs were activated in the colon of IBS mice. We then demonstrated that apremilast (10 μM) significantly suppressed TNF-α/IFN-γ stimulated activation of rat EGC cell line CRL-2690 and primary EGCs in vitro, as well as the secretion of EGCs-derived pain mediators and inflammatory factors while ameliorating oxidative stress. These effects depended on the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) signaling pathway, which was validated in Nrf-2 knockout EGCs. These results suggest that inhibition of PDE4 by apremilast suppresses EGCs activation by activating the Nrf-2 signaling pathway, leading to decreased expression of pain mediators and inflammatory factors while ameliorating oxidative stress, ultimately alleviating IBS.",

    "title": "SOCS1 depletion drives osteosarcoma stemness and chemoresistance by suppressing ACTN4 degradation",
    "abstract": "Chemoresistance is a major factor contributing to the poor prognosis of osteosarcoma. Increasing evidence underscores the pivotal role of enhanced tumor stemness in driving drug resistance. In this study we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the chemoresistance and stemness in osteosarcoma. Two cisplatin-resistant osteosarcoma cell line models (U2OS-DDPr and 143B-DDPr) were established by culturing parental U2OS and 143B cells with escalating cisplatin concentrations (250 ng/mL to 2.5 µg/mL) over a 6-month period. We found that the expression levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, were markedly downregulated in both chemo-resistant osteosarcoma cells and osteosarcoma tumor specimens, and the reduced expression in tumor specimens was correlated to poor prognosis in osteosarcoma patients. Silencing SOCS1 significantly reduced cisplatin sensitivity, enhanced spheroid formation capacity, and upregulated the expression of stem cell markers including SOX2, OCT4, and CD44. Conversely, restoring SOCS1 expression reversed these effects both in vitro and in vivo. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry analysis revealed that SOCS1 bound to ACTN4 and suppressed its protein expression by promoting K63-linked ubiquitination, ultimately leading to proteasomal degradation. Specifically, the SH2 domain of SOCS1 interacted with the N-terminal region of ACTN4, with Lys66 of ACTN4 playing a critical role in facilitating this interaction and subsequent ubiquitination. In addition, the expression of ACTN4 was highly enriched in chemo-resistant tissues, and its overexpression was positively associated with advanced tumor staging. Importantly, ACTN4 functioned as an oncogene to promote cisplatin resistance and stemness in osteosarcoma. Furthermore, we found that wortmannin, an inhibitor of ACTN4, could markedly block the effect of SOCS1 silencing on osteosarcoma aggressiveness. In conclusion, SOCS1 deletion promotes stemness and chemoresistance in osteosarcoma by inhibiting ACTN4 ubiquitination and degradation, which offers promising therapeutic targets for potentiating chemosensitivity in osteosarcoma.",

    "title": "Performance of nitric acid and mineral enriched system versus phosphoric acid and universal adhesive in cervical carious lesions: a randomized clinical trial",
    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo evaluate the clinical performance of nitric acid associated with a mineral-enriched adhesive system compared to the conventional approach of phosphoric acid and a universal adhesive in cervical carious lesion restorations.Materials and methodsTwenty-six individuals with 44 cervical anterior carious lesions were randomized into two equal parallel groups. The intervention group received a nitric acid etch(Clean and Boost dentin enamel cleanser, Vista Apex, USA)in conjunction with a mineral-enriched adhesive and a flowable composite liner(RE-GEN, Vista Apex, USA). Control group treated with phosphoric acid(Scotchbond Universal Etchant, 3 M ESPE), a universal adhesive(Single Bond Universal Adhesive, 3 M ESPE), and a standard liner(Filtek Supreme, 3 M ESPE). All cavities were restored using nanohybrid resin composite(Filtek Z350XT, 3 M ESPE). Postoperative sensitivity was assessed both qualitatively, using the modified USPHS criteria, and quantitatively, using a visual analog scale (VAS), as the primary outcome. In addition, clinical performance regarding marginal discoloration, adaptation, secondary caries, and retention was evaluated as secondary outcomes using modified USPHS criteria. Outcomes were assessed at 24 h, 6, 12, and 18 months. The data was statistically analyzed using intention-to-treat analysis. Intergroup comparisons were performed using the Chi-Squared test with a significance level (p≤ 0.05), and intragroup comparisons were analyzed using Cochran’s Q test with a confidence level of 95% and a study power of 80%. Relative risk was used to assess clinical significance. The survival rate was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier and Log-rank tests. The study was conducted following the CONSORT 2025 guidelines.ResultsBoth groups demonstrated similar performance in terms of postoperative sensitivity, retention, secondary caries, and marginal adaptation, as assessed using modified USPHS criteria. However, there was a significant increase in marginal discoloration within the phosphoric acid groups after 18 months. There was 50% less risk of sensitivity with nitric acid compared to phosphoric acid using the VAS scale (CI (0.2512 to 0.9953);p= 0.0485). The tested groups showed an equal survival rate (p= 0.3771).ConclusionCombining nitric acid with a mineral-enriched system is a promising approach for restoring cervical carious lesions.",

    "title": "Deal bonanza for ADC assets continues",
    "abstract": "Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) in oncology have been some of the most sought-after assets in the biopharma dealmaking landscape in the past two years. For example, in 2023, Pfizer purchased Seagen, one of the pioneers of the technology underlying ADCs, for $43 billion, and AbbVie completed its $10.1-billion purchase of another ADC technology pioneer, ImmunoGen, in early 2024. Several ADC-focused licensing deals potentially worth at least $1 billion were also signed last year, such as Roche’s deal with MediLink Therapeutics on a preclinical ADC candidate targeting the hepatocyte growth factor receptor c-MET1.The momentum is being sustained in 2025. Roche struck the first ADC deal of the year on 1 January, potentially committing more than $1 billion to partner on Innovent Biologics’ IBI3009, an ADC targeting DLL3 that entered phase 1 development in 2024 (see Deal snapshot). This announcement followed hot on the heels of another deal focused on an ADC candidate targeting DLL3 in early-stage development: on 29 December 2024, IDEAYA Biosciences agreed to pay $75 million upfront and up to $1.045 billion in total to license SHR-4849 from Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals.These latest deals highlight two trends in the ADC field. One is the rise of China as a source of ADC assets, with Innovent Biologics and Hengrui Pharma both being headquartered there, as is MediLink Therapeutics. The second is the pursuit of best-in-class activity for promising target antigens on cancer cells, such as those that have recently been clinically validated by drugs from other antibody-based modalities. For DLL3, an antigen that is overexpressed on solid tumors such as small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), the pioneering drug—Amgen’s DLL3 × CD3 bispecific antibody Imdelltra (tarlatamab)—was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for SCLC in 2024.A deal potentially worth up to $1.34 billion between Astellas Pharma and Chinese company Evopoint Biosciences also reflects both trends (see Deal snapshot). Last year, Astellas received the first FDA approval for a drug that targets claudin-18.2 (CLDN18.2) for CLDN18.2-positive gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas, the drug being the monoclonal antibody Vyloy (zolbetuximab). Following the deal signed in May 2025 with Evopoint, Astellas’s pipeline now also contains an early-stage ADC candidate targeted at CLDN18.2. This tight-junction protein is aberrantly expressed in some patients with gastric cancers and has become a popular target for multiple modalities in recent years2.In February this year, the US biotech company Radiance Biopharma also partnered with a Chinese company, licensing an early-stage ADC candidate known as SYS6005 from CSPC Megalith Biopharmaceutical in a deal potentially worth up to $1.24 billion (see Deal snapshot). The leader in the field for the target of this ADC—ROR1— is Merck & Co’s ADC zilovertamab vedotin, for which a response rate of 100% was recently reported in a phase 2 trial in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Merck gained this ADC, which is now in a phase 3 trial for DLBCL, through its $2.75 billion buy-out of VelosBio in 2020.The search for novel ADC targets was the focus of another potential $1-billion deal signed by Roche this year, beginning a collaboration with Oxford BioTherapeutics (see Deal snapshot). Oxford BioTherapeutics has developed a platform known as OGAP-Verify to identify targets for antibody-based drugs such as ADCs. OGAP-Verify is based on data on the abundance of around 7,000 membrane proteins across solid and blood cancers, as well as normal tissues. Once potential targets have been validated, Roche will drive further research and development of drug candidates.",

    "abstract": "Neuroscience drug research and development (R&D) has rebounded in the past few years, encouraged by successes with pioneering therapies such as Karuna’s KarXT (xanomeline–trospium) for schizophrenia, which Bristol Myers Squibb gained when it completed its acquisition of the company for $14 billion last year. Major deals in the past 12 months have also highlighted industry interest in potential first-in-class drugs for neurodegenerative diseases.Approaches beyond targeting amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are of particular appeal, as indicated by Sanofi’s acquisition of Vigil Neuroscience in May for at least $470 million (see Deal snapshot). Evidence has grown for a key role of the immune system in AD, and Vigil’s oral small-molecule candidate VG-3927 modulates microglial activation by acting as an agonist of TREM2, which is thought to be a regulator of AD risk. Positive results from a phase 1 trial of VG-3927 were reported by Vigil in January, and a phase 2 trial in patients with AD is expected to begin before the end of 2025.Understanding how antibodies produced by the immune systems of some individuals with diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) could provide protection against disease progression. Understanding such observations is at the core of a platform developed by Alchemab Therapeutics. In May 2025, Eli Lilly and Company signed a deal with Alchemab potentially worth up to $415 million to license its candidate ATLX-1282 (see Deal snapshot).

    "title": "Systemic activation of NRF2 contributes to the therapeutic efficacy of clinically-approved KRAS-G12C anti-cancer drugs",
    "abstract": "BackgroundThe development and clinical success of KRASG12Cinhibitors was a landmark achievement in anti-cancer drug development, as oncogenic KRAS had long been considered an intractable therapeutic target. Patients withKRASmutant lung cancers frequently present with co-mutations in the KEAP1-NRF2 pathway, and because genetic activation of NRF2 results in resistance to all current anti-cancer therapies, we were motivated to explore how aberrant activation of NRF2 impacts the clinical response to KRASG12Cinhibitors.MethodsA broad range of techniques, including genetic knockouts, scRNA-seq and surface plasmon resonance, were used to determine the effect of KRASG12Cdrugs on NRF2.ResultsAt physiologically-relevant concentrations, both of the clinically-approved KRASG12Cinhibitors Sotorasib and Adagrasib also function as inducers of NRF2. Mechanistically, the same cysteine-targeting functionality which allows these electrophilic drugs to inhibit the mutant KRASG12Cprotein also facilitates their binding to cysteine-based sensors in KEAP1, resulting in the upregulation of the NRF2-dependent gene expression program.ConclusionsThe activation of NRF2 by KRAS-G12C inhibitors represents a unique example of anti-cancer drugs which positively regulate the activity of a protein which is normally considered to be an oncogene. In both the malignant cells of the tumour and immune cells within the microenvironment, activation of NRF2 by electrophilic KRAS inhibitors positively contributes to the clinical efficacy of these drugs by promoting anti-cancer immunity. This unprecedented situation, in which the NRF2-dependent oxidative stress response is induced globally within cancer patients, has a number of important clinical implications, particularly in relation to ongoing combination chemotherapy clinical trials, as well as for selecting patient populations which may derive the most benefit from G12Ci anti-cancer drugs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNeurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by neurofibromas, with 5–13% of patients risk developing malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST). Current treatments for MPNST are largely ineffective. AXL, overexpressed in MPNST, is a potential target for Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy. This study evaluates the immunophenotypes, efficacy, and safety of NF1-derived AXL-CAR-T cells in treating MPNST.MethodsAXL-CAR-T cells, containing an anti-AXL single-chain variable fragment, were derived from NF1 patients (n= 27) and healthy donors (n= 15). Immunophenotypes were characterized using CCR7, CD45RA, CD4, and CD8 markers. The cytotoxicity of CAR-T cells was tested in vitro against MPNST cells, and efficacy and safety were evaluated in an MPNST xenograft mouse model. Multiplex immunoassays and ELISA measured cytokines and granzyme b release.ResultsAXL-CAR-T cells from both NF1 patients and healthy donors had a similar partition in stem cell-like memory T cell composition and comparable ex vivo expansion. AXL-CAR-T cells from both groups effectively lysed MPNST cells in vitro. In vivo, tumor volumes in xenograft mice were significantly reduced with no on-target off-tumor toxicity.ConclusionsNF1 patient-derived AXL-CAR-T cells demonstrated similar quality and efficacy to those from healthy donors, supporting their potential autologous therapy for MPNST.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common liver cancer often diagnosed at an advanced stage. While chemotherapies such as sorafenib is effective for some patients, others show poor responses, necessitating new treatments. Overexpression of MYCN/NCYM was recently shown to contribute to the development of HCC. This study investigated the effects of Pentagamavunone-1 (PGV-1), a curcumin analog with strong antiproliferative properties, on HCC cells expressing MYCN/NCYM. PGV-1 was more effective than curcumin and sorafenib in inhibiting HCC cell proliferation by inducing mitotic arrest, oxidative stress, and senescence. In MYCN-positive JHH-7 cells, PGV-1 treatment increased phosphorylation of aurora A, cyclin B1, and PLK1. PGV-1 also suppressed MYCN/NCYM transcription and destabilized MYCN protein by inducing phosphorylation at Ser54 and Thr58. In a xenograft model, PGV-1 significantly reduced tumor formation and growth. These findings highlight PGV-1’s potential as a targeted therapy for MYCN-overexpressing HCC, warranting further development.",

    "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common and lethal malignancies in developing countries, with particularly high prevalence in China. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have garnered increasing attention for their roles in disease pathogenesis. While circRNAs can be translated, there have been few investigations into the biological functions of “translatable circRNAs” in the initiation and progression of gastric adenocarcinoma. In this study, we identified a circRNA, circMAP3K13, which inhibits the proliferation and migration of GC cells. CircMAP3K13 was found to encode a previously unreported 26 kDa protein, designated MAP3K13-232aa. Mechanistically, MAP3K13-232aa binds directly to the kinase domain of IKKα and enhances its activity, thereby promoting NF-κB signaling. This activation leads to upregulation of NLRP3 and increased cisplatin-induced pyroptosis in GC cells. Moreover, MAP3K13-232aa enhances pyroptosis and reduces tumorigenicity and metastasis in vivo. Taken together, both circMAP3K13 and its encoded protein MAP3K13-232aa represent potential therapeutic targets in GC.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) family is a major member of the deubiquitinating enzyme family that plays important and diverse roles in multiple tumors. The roles and mechanisms of action of USP family members in ovarian cancer are not well understood. This study aimed to screen all the USP family members and explored the specific function of USP43 in ovarian cancer. The expression levels of USP family members in ovarian cancer were screened using bioinformatics analysis, and the specific function of USP43 was explored through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Functional assays, including cell viability, ferroptosis, and tumor xenograft models, were employed. In short, USP43 drives the ferroptosis suppression by activating the expression of SLC7A11 through FASN-HIF1α pathway. USP43 is an important prognostic factor for ovarian cancer, with its overexpression promoting ovarian cancer progression and its knockdown inhibiting it. Mechanistically, USP43, which is transcriptionally activated by YY1, stabilizes FASN through deubiquitination, and FASN activates SLC7A11 expression by stabilizing HIF1α. Furthermore, the combination of cisplatin and the SLC7A11 inhibitor HG106 significantly inhibits the growth of ovarian tumors. Thus, targeting the USP43-FASN-HIF1α-SLC7A11 axis can inhibit ferroptosis and promote platinum sensitivity in ovarian cancer.",

When we used a similar level of IFN-γ from primary activated NK cells and sNK cells, the IFN-γ secreted from sNK cells exhibited greater potential to induce differentiation in both oral and pancreatic tumors. It is long known in the field of NK cells that primary NK cells induce significant lysis of stem-like/poorly differentiated tumors, but differentiated tumors are generally resistant to primary NK cell-mediated lysis. sNK cells, unlike primary activated NK cells, are found to highly target stem-like as well as differentiated tumors, indicating sNK cells can target not only tumors specific to NK cells but also those targeted by CD8+ T cells. Differentiation by sNK cells was inhibited less by the antibodies to IFN-γ and TNF-α when compared to that mediated by the primary activated NK cells, suggesting the role of other unexplored mechanisms in sNK cell-induced tumor differentiation. Overall, this study suggests the role of sNK cells in targeting the heterogeneous population of tumors, likely mediating the functions of both NK cells and T cells in controlling tumors, and inducing them to be effectively targeted by chemotherapy.",

Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), an essential hepatic non-parenchymal cells, have a key effect on fibrogenesis, with their activation being a hallmark of liver fibrosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), the small non-coding RNAs, become the critical biomarkers and regulatory molecules in fibrotic processes. Among them, miR-125a-5p is implicated in cancer and inflammatory pathways, yet its functional role and mechanistic involvement in HSC activation remain poorly understood. According to our findings, miR-125a-5p expression was significantly decreased in TGF-β-activated HSC-T6 cells. Notably, ectopic miR-125a-5p overexpression effectively inhibited TGF-β-mediated HSC-T6 activation. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-125a-5p attenuated HSC activation while ameliorating liver fibrosis through regulating the TGF-β/Smad2/3 pathway and autophagy. Additionally, TGFβR1 was miR-125a-5p’s target gene. Collectively, miR-125a-5p negatively regulates HSC activation in liver fibrosis, exerting its anti-fibrotic activities through suppressing the TGF-β/Smad2/3 pathway and autophagy modulation.",

This study provides a comprehensive, anatomically enhanced characterization of the superior longitudinal system (SLS) by integrating in-vivo tractography with ex-vivo dissection within the same radiological space. Using a data-driven cortex-to-cortex pairing approach leveraging gyral-sulcal macroanatomical landmarks, we reconstructed the dorsal associative connectivity of the frontal cortex in 39 healthy participants. We identified 45 SLS components, of which (i) 22 were validated and refined through ex-vivo dissection, (ii) 17 were deemed anatomically plausible despite lacking ex-vivo confirmation, and (iii) 6 were classified as anatomically implausible. The anatomical description of plausible sub-SLS templates revealed fundamental organizational principles of the system: (i) a medio-lateral and dorso-ventral hierarchy, where dorsal regions connect dorsally and ventral regions ventrally, and (ii) a depth-dependent organization, with shorter, superficial fibers linking proximal areas and longer, deeper fibers connecting distal regions. Pearson’s correlation confirmed a significant positive relationship between streamline length and distance from the cortex (r = 0.689, p < 0.001). This study emphasizes the need for a distributed and integrated understanding of brain connectivity beyond classical bundle definition, and provides a robust anatomical foundation for future population-based WM atlases using bundle-specific tractography.",

    "abstract": "The remarkable plasticity of hepatocytes underlies diverse roles in distinct patterns of liver injury. Specifically, hepatocyte-derived progenitor cells play dominant roles in driving the regenerative response during chronic liver injury. However, the potential for hepatocytes to transdifferentiate into progenitor-like cells following partial hepatectomy (PHx) remains debated. In this study, we generate single-nucleus Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (snATAC-seq) data from mice subjected to the 2/3 PHx, aiming to characterize the dynamics of hepatocyte chromatin accessibility and the existence of hepatic progenitor cells. Our findings reveal that PHx induces dynamic changes in hepatocyte chromatin accessibility, giving rise to distinct hepatocyte subtypes balancing metabolic functions and proliferative activities. Notably, a subset of hepatocytes displays enhanced accessibility of progenitor cell-associated genes (e.g.,Sox9andTnfrsf12a), along with increased accessibility to reprogramming-related genes (RRGs). By integrating with transcriptome data, we identify a hepatocyte population exhibiting progenitor-like traits. However, these progenitor-like cells show limited contribution to liver regeneration in the PHx model. Mechanistically, our results suggest that disrupted critical crosstalks (e.g., Pdgfa-Pdgfra signaling) with immune cells are attributed to impaired hepatic progenitor cells activation. Moreover, concurrent activation of growth signals in hepatocytes and other non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) suppresses the activation of progenitor cells.",

Prenatal exposure to electronic-cigarette (e-cig) aerosol has been shown to alter neuronal differentiation in a neuron type-specific manner. However, it remains unclear whether e-cig aerosol exposure affects gene expression by altering H3K4me1 and H3K27me3 modifications. Using single-nucleus joint profiling of  H3K4me1-H3K27me3 and transcriptome of neonatal rat prefrontal cortex, we demonstrate that e-cig aerosol exposure alters the H3K4me1-H3K27me3 methylation patterns in the promoters,i.e., the bivalency, of many cell type-specific genes, impacting gene expression levels, neuronal differentiation and functions. Additionally, the prenatal e-cig aerosol exposure impacts the expression of genes related to circadian entrainment, calcium signaling, protein kinase signaling transduction, and synaptic transmission. These results suggest that nicotine addiction may be epigenetically imprinted at a very early stage of brain development.",

    "abstract": "The formation and maintenance of epithelia is critical for animal development and survival. Central to epithelial integrity are cadherin-based complexes called adherens junctions (AJs), which form physically robust but inherently dynamic cell-cell adhesions. How AJs function at the molecular level remains incompletely understood because techniques to study the central AJ proteins within the dynamic adhesion structure are scarce. Using a conformation sensitive probe that is amenable to fluorescence lifetime and anisotropy imaging, we demonstrate that the maturation of AJs is accompanied by a conformational change in the actin-binding domain of α-catenin. The structural transition depends on the degree of junctional maturation and requires actin polymerisation, but it is insensitive to vinculin binding to α-catenin. These different conformational states correlate with distinct α-catenin mobilities, with α-catenin unexpectedly showing an overall increased protein turnover in mature AJs. Collectively, the data reveal that α-catenin undergoes a previously proposed C-terminal conformational transition during epidermal differentiation to form mechanically stable yet dynamic cell-cell adhesions.",

    "abstract": "Although the photochemistry of nitrobenzene has been extensively studied, the assignment of fragmentation channels and their specific dynamics remains challenging. Here the photochemistry of nitrobenzene following 240 nm excitation into its S4excited singlet state is investigated by femtosecond laser-induced ionization using an intense 800 nm pulse, coupled with time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging and covariance mapping. We assign photochemical channels by observing correlations between the molecular fragment ions of the associated product pairs, enabling the time-resolved dynamics of channels leading to NO, NO2, and C6H5NO to be fully characterized. NO is produced via two distinct pathways, leading to translationally cold and hot photofragments with risetimes of  ~ 8 ps and  ~ 14 ps, respectively. NO2photofragments are characterised by a bimodal risetime of ~ 8 ps and≳2 ns, and can be detected within the first picosecond following ultra-violet photon absorption. C6H5NO is formed with a risetime of 17 ps. Kinetic energy disposals determined for the three chemical channels agree well with previous work. The techniques employed offer new opportunities to study the time-resolved photochemistry of relatively complex molecules in the gas phase.",

However, the long-lived ligand triplet state limits the temperature sensitivity of lanthanide emission. This study demonstrates an enhancement in the temperature sensitivity of Tb(III) emission by introducing an energy escape pathway from the ligand triplet state. A dinuclear Tb(III)–Nd(III) complex containing hexafluoroacetylacetonate (hfa) and triphenylene bridging ligands was prepared, which exhibits temperature-dependent energy transfer from the Tb(III)-emitting state to the hfa triplet state. The triplet level of the hfa ligand is similar to that of the triphenylene ligand, inducing effective energy transfer from hfa to Nd(III)viathe triphenylene ligands. This energy transfer pathway provides a short-lived excited state of hfa ligands, resulting in the highest temperature sensitivity (4.4% K−1) among emission lifetime-based thermometers of lanthanide complexes.",

Using historical maps, archival documents, satellite images and settlement datasets, we map changes in montane forest extent in Kenya from 1910 to 2024. We estimate that during the colonial period (1910–1975) ~ 46% of the montane forest was lost, mainly attributed to large-scale forest concessions and agricultural conversions, and a further ~20% lost during the post-colonial period (1975–2024), attributed to post-colonial resettlement of small-scale farmers in colonially-designated areas and forest excisions.

Across temperate Europe, shrub landscapes dominate the area burned, with the moisture content of fuels during these events determining the threat posed. Current controls on the moisture content of temperate fuel constituents and their response to future extreme heatwaves are not known. We took field measurements of live and dead heather (Calluna vulgaris) and organic soil moisture content across the UK over 3 years, including an intensive sampling campaign during the July 2022 heatwave. Here, we show that the fuel moisture content of live fuel is associated significantly with phenological variables, dead fuel only with weather variables, whilst organic-rich ground fuels are more associated with landscape variables. However, during the record 2022 heatwave there was a harmonisation in fuel moisture controls across different fuel constituents, with those controls being driven by weather alone. This caused synchronised extreme dryness outside of current seasonal norms across all fuel constituents at the same time and place. Future intense summer heatwaves can therefore be expected to align the most severe conditions for fire ignition, spread and impact in traditionally non-fire prone regions, producing humid temperate landscapes susceptible to extreme wildfire events.",

Using a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative analysis and topic modeling of petition data, we demonstrate that the 2021 Henan flood, one of the deadliest in China’s recent history, led to a sharp increase in petitions concerning drainage, neighborhood safety, and flood prevention. These demands, although not framed in climate-specific language, reflect calls for state-led adaptation that is concrete and localized. We also find that concern about the disaster and preparedness extended beyond Henan, prompting appeals in unaffected provinces.

Charge hopping displacements feature exponentially-decaying arms, strongly departing from Gaussian distributions. 2D Brownian dynamics simulations evidence that these exponential tails originate from molecular jumps between trapping sites, allowing a consistent match between statistical distributions and the effective diffusion coefficient. Our study highlights the key yet overlooked role of defects in regulating interfacial charge transport, with relevance for energy applications.",

    "abstract": "The transparenthP4 phase of dense sodium (Na), stable above 200 GPa, has been computed to be an electride in which valence electrons are localised on interstitial lattice sites within the structure. However, there is no experimental evidence for this interstitial electron localisation in Na, or indeed in other high-density electride phases. Using static compression and single-crystal X-ray diffraction techniques, we have grown and studied a single-crystal sample of Na in thehP4 phase at 223 GPa. Using atomic form factors forhP4-Na derived from quantum crystallography techniques, we present experimental results to support the electride nature of this phase.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMale infertility (MI) is the sole cause of 20–30% of infertility cases, and it is a contributing factor for an additional 15–20% of cases. However, the full breadth of potential MI risk factors and adverse health outcomes has not been explored.MethodsWe used electronic health records (EHRs) from the University of California (UC) and Stanford to identify MI-associated comorbidities. We identified 6531 and 5551 MI patients at UC and Stanford, respectively, and 8353 and 2464 vasectomy control patients at UC and Stanford, respectively. Low-dimensional embeddings of patients’ diagnosis profiles based on MI status, demographics, or hospital utilization were compared using either Kruskal–Wallis tests followed by post hoc Dunn’s tests or Mann–WhitneyUtests. We used logistic regression to identify MI-associated comorbidities prior to or after 6 months of a patient’s first MI or vasectomy-related record. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to compare primary versus sensitivity logistic regression analyses as well as UC versus Stanford logistic regression analyses. Cox regression was used to assess whether patients had a higher risk of receiving diagnoses significantly associated with MI after the 6-month cutoff at UC.ResultsHere, we identify 15 diagnoses that are positively associated with MI before the 6-month cutoff across both hospital systems and all analyses, including less expected comorbidities such as hypothyroidism and other anemias. Using Cox regression, we find that patients have a higher risk of receiving 11 out of 13 diagnoses positively associated with MI after the 6-month cutoff at UC.ConclusionsOur findings can set the groundwork for future studies to clarify the relationship between less expected comorbidities and MI.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundKlebsiella pneumoniaeis ubiquitous in animals, humans, and the environment, facilitating the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulence traits. Most studies are primarily focused on human clinical isolates, leaving critical gaps in understanding non-human reservoirs and cross-species transmission risks.MethodsWe combined large-scale genomic analyses with in vitro and in vivo infection models to characterize the evolutionary dynamics of 2809K. pneumoniaeisolates sourced from 8 host species across 57 countries. We examined the potential for cross-host transmission ofK. pneumoniae, explored its AMR and virulence characteristics across different hosts, and evaluated the temporal evolution of AMR and virulence.ResultsHere, we demonstrate that the rise in AMR strongly correlates with the global expansion of multidrug-resistant (MDR) sequence types, while the increase in virulence is partially driven by the acquisition of key virulence loci in certain MDR clones. Population structure analyses show no distinct genetic boundaries between human- and animal-derived strains, strengthening the evidence for cross-species transmission potential.ConclusionsThese findings underscore the urgent need for a One Health approach to address the dual threat of AMR and hypervirulence, providing critical insights to guide global surveillance and public health interventions.",

Predicting post-heatstroke organ injury remains difficult, delaying timely medical intervention. This study aims to identify potential blood biomarkers that reflect organ stress and recovery status following heatstroke.MethodsPlasma samples (n= 12) from clinically diagnosed classical (non-exertional) heatstroke patients were collected at diagnosis and recovery. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to analyze protein expression, identifying 359 protein spots. Selected proteins showing differential expression were validated by Western blotting.ResultsHere, five proteins—alpha-1 antitrypsin, alpha-1 microglobulin/bikunin precursor, apolipoprotein A-IV, clusterin, and complement component 2—show significant changes between the two timepoints. These proteins are linked to inflammatory, coagulation, and lipid metabolism pathways. Alpha-1 antitrypsin, alpha-1 microglobulin, and complement component 2 may reflect the resolution of inflammation, while apolipoprotein A-IV and clusterin indicate renal stress. The alpha-1 microglobulin–IgA complex may exert anti-inflammatory effects. Complement component 2, an initiator of the complement cascade, has not been previously reported to be associated with heat stress.ConclusionsThe findings suggest that these proteins may serve as blood biomarkers to assess heatstroke severity and monitor recovery.

    "title": "Highly efficient broadband THz mixing and upconversion with Dirac materials",
    "abstract": "The use of the THz frequency domain in future network generations offers an unparalleled level of capacity, which can enhance innovative applications in wireless communication, analytics, and imaging. Communication technologies rely on frequency mixing, enabling signals to be converted from one frequency to another and transmitted from a sender to a receiver. Technically, this process is implemented using nonlinear components such as diodes or transistors. However, the highest operating frequency of this approach is limited to sub-THz bands. Here, we demonstrate the upconversion of a weak sub-THz signal from a photoconductive antenna to multiple THz bands. The key element is a high-mobility HgTe-based heterostructure with electronic band inversion, leading to one of the strongest third-order nonlinearities among all materials in the THz range. Due to the Dirac character of electron dispersion, the highly intense sub-THz radiation is efficiently mixed with the antenna signal, resulting in a THz response at linear combinations of their frequencies. The field conversion efficiency above 2% is provided by a bare tensile-strained HgTe layer with a thickness below 100 nm at room temperature under ambient conditions. Devices based on Dirac materials allow for high degree of integration, with field-enhancing metamaterial structures, making them very promising for THz communication with unprecedented data transfer rate.",

Such nanowires exhibit enhanced spatial confinement of carriers, potentially enlarging the accessible topological phase space compared to conventional core/full-shell structures. Inspired by these insights and as an essential preliminary step, we experimentally investigate GaAs/InAs core/shell nanowires with aluminum half-shells, aiming to understand how Andreev-bound states are influenced by their complex geometric confinement. With normal contacts we observed pronouncedh/eflux periodic oscillations in the magnetoconductance, which can be explained via the presence of a tubular conductive channel in the InAs shell. Conversely, the switching current in Josephson junctions oscillates with approximately half that period, i.e.,h/2e, indicating a full proximitization of the InAs shell from the half-shell superconducting contacts and a successful imprint of the non-trivial geometric topology onto the Andreev transport spectrum in the junction enclosing threading magnetic flux. On these structures, we systematically studied the gate-, field-, and temperature-dependent evolution of the supercurrent.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitous tendency of superconducting cuprates to form charge density waves (CDWs) has reignited interest in the nature of their electron-phonon interaction and its role in shaping their phase diagrams. While pronounced dispersion anomalies were reported in several phonon branches, their precise connection to charge order and superconductivity remains unresolved. Here, using high-resolution inelastic x-ray scattering under low temperature and high magnetic field, we uncover a striking phonon renormalization in YBa2Cu3O6+x. It appears along a reciprocal space trajectory connecting the wave vectors of a short-range 2D-CDW, emerging above the superconducting transition, and a long-range 3D-CDW, appearing only when superconductivity is strongly suppressed. The spectral changes are strongest around the wave vector of the 3D-CDW despite the fact that it is absent in our experimental conditions. Our findings challenge conventional phonon self-energy renormalization models, instead support a scenario in which low-energy phonons hybridize with dispersive CDW excitations and provide insights into the interplay between lattice vibrations and electronic correlations in high-temperature superconductors.",

    "title": "What’s new in EJHG this autumn",
    "abstract": "The first issue of autumn presents a holistic overview of genomic medicine, including clinical diagnostics, the mechanisms underlying genetic conditions, healthcare system-related challenges, and innovative digital solutions, alongside training and standardisation efforts that are shaping the future of the field. The role of genomic medicine in diagnosis and treatment guidelines is growing over time. Alonso-González et al. demonstrate the clinical utility of a tiered virtual gene panel approach in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis by identifying rare pathogenic variants, particularly in telomere-related genes RTEL1 and NAF1 [1]. Similarly, Chartier et al. highlight clinical utility of germline genetic testing in prostate cancer, revealing a significant enrichment of ATM and other DNA repair gene variants. Their findings highlight the refined genetic referral criteria and targeted treatment strategies for prostate cancers [2]. Leardini et al. report neonatal myeloproliferative disease (MPD) in ten patients with SH2B3 loss-of-function (LoF) mutations. They expand the clinical spectrum of MPD with later-onset thrombocytosis, and features such as growth delay, neurological impairment, and autoimmunity, that highlights the importance of long-term follow-up of affected individuals [3]. Also in this issue, Sagath et al. present comprehensive analysis of structural variants (SVs) in the NEB gene by analysing 35 families. They establish a link between heterozygous deletions and dominantly inherited distal myopathy, contributing valuable insights into genotype–phenotype correlation [4]. Understanding genetic neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative conditions requires both insight into underlying mechanisms and the appropriate application of diagnostic innovations. Demaegd et al. challenge the traditional separation of ALS and SCA2 by showing that ATXN2 repeat expansions contribute to a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders, including ALS, SCA2, Parkinsonism, and dementia. They propose the unifying term “ATXN2-related neurodegeneration”, emphasising pleiotropy and calling for a rethinking of current diagnostic categories [5]. Additionally, Mazel et al. elucidate the complex mechanisms underlying 16p13.3 microdeletions, highlighting their role in neurodevelopmental disease [6]. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an effective modality in the diagnosis of neurogenetic conditions, although its accessibility is still an issue in some countries. Van Tonder et al. demonstrate that targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels can achieve a diagnostic yield comparable to high-income countries for neurogenetic conditions in resource-limited settings [7]. Also, untranslated regions (UTRs), often overlooked, can cause disease through various mechanisms. In this issue, Wieder et al.’s review provides essential resources to support the interpretation of UTR variants in clinical genetic testing [8]. Genomic medicine is also intercalated with health policy, ethics, digital transformation, and accessibility. In this issue, several studies explore these different aspects of the process. Usta et al. explore public and professional views on biobanking. Their survey study reveals strong support from both patients and healthcare professionals while also uncovering concerns around privacy and genetic discrimination and offers actionable insights to enhance biobank participation and ethical implementation in clinical settings [9]. Dawson-McClaren et al. shed light on the underutilisation of genetic testing by general paediatricians in Australia, despite available funding. They report a lack of capability, opportunity, and motivation as key barriers, which underscores the need for structured support to integrate genetic testing into routine paediatric practice [10]. At a population level, another Australian study demonstrates that expanded reproductive carrier screening (RCS) can be a beneficial investment for healthcare systems and society, as their study supports that RCS for 569 conditions is clinically impactful and cost-saving [11]. To bridge gaps in patient experience and service delivery, Saeedi et al. share their experience with the Genetics Navigator (GN), a platform designed to enhance genetic services from pre-test education to post-test management. With user-centred development and high usability scores, GN promises a strong potential to improve the accessibility and quality of genetic care [12]. Of course, the quality of speciality training for the next generation geneticists and every effort for a standardised education model are crucial for the future of genomic medicine. In this issue of EJHG, Turnpenny et al. describe the development of the European Certificate in Medical Genetics and Genomics (ECMGG) and its growing role in standardising specialist certification across Europe [13]. Complementing this, Moog et al. present the 2023 revision of the European Training Requirements for Medical Genetics (ETR-MG), which restructures the curriculum and integrates the ECMGG, aligning training with contemporary medical education principles [14].

    "abstract": "Endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs, including TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9) play crucial roles in immune responses by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns; however, their aberrant activation is implicated in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Developing endosomal TLR inhibitors against autoimmune diseases is clinically essential. Here we synthesized and optimized a series of compounds based on a candidate structure. The lead compounds, ETI41 and ETI60, potently inhibited endosomal TLR-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling with nanomolar activity in cellular, biophysical and in vivo assays. Both ETI41 and ETI60 selectively inhibited endosomal TLRs without affecting surface TLRs, as confirmed by immunoblotting and biophysical analyses. RNA sequencing revealed that these inhibitors modulated the expression of genes associated with inflammation. In vivo studies have shown that oral administration of ETI41 or ETI60 effectively ameliorates symptoms in mouse models of psoriasis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. These findings indicate that ETI41 and ETI60 hold significant potential as therapeutic agents for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases through selective targeting of endosomal TLRs.",

    "abstract": "Renal fibrosis is a consequence of chronic kidney disease, which is estimated to affect 10–14% of the global population. The molecular mechanisms in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis are still unclear, and there is a lack of effective therapies. Here we identified decreased levels of p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) in kidney tissues with fibrosis and demonstrated that PCAF-specific knockout in proximal tubular cells accelerates renal fibrosis in both unilateral ureteral obstruction surgery and folic acid-induced models. Conversely, overexpressing PCAF in the kidney using adenovirus mitigated unilateral ureteral obstruction-induced renal fibrosis. Importantly, PCAF inhibits the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of proximal tubular cells by transcriptionally activating adherens junction genes. Moreover, we observed that TGF-β signaling induces lysosomal degradation of PCAF, suggesting that PCAF reduction is affected in the fibrotic milieu. These findings confirm that PCAF is a negative regulator of renal fibrosis and suggest that it could serve as a novel therapeutic target for patients with chronic kidney disease.",

    "abstract": "Normal mitochondrial function is essential for human induced pluripotent stem (hiPS) cell differentiation into definitive endoderm (DE). However, the underlying mechanisms that maintain mitochondrial homeostasis during DE differentiation are not fully elucidated. Here we report that glyoxalase 1 (GLO1) is a novel regulator of DE differentiation and subsequent alveolar development in hiPS cells via maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. To determine the role of GLO1 in these processes, we first established GLO1-knockout hiPS cells using CRISPR–Cas9-mediated genome deletion and demonstrated that GLO1 deficiency significantly reduced the differentiation efficiency of DE, leading to defects in alveolar epithelial cell differentiation and alveolar organoid development. Moreover, GLO1 deficiency interfered with mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration during the early DE stage. Defects in DE differentiation due to dysfunctional mitochondria were effectively rescued by high-dose treatment with CHIR99021, a glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitor. Our study uncovered an essential role of GLO1 as a key regulator of mitochondrial homeostasis for early lineage specification of hiPS cells, moving away from its conventional role as a primary enzyme in methylglyoxal detoxification.",

    "abstract": "Here we investigate the effects and mechanisms of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in regulating chondrocyte mechanics during inflammation in the progression of osteoarthritis (OA). Primary porcine chondrocytes and human OA chondrocytes were isolated and cultured. Cell mechanical properties were measured using atomic force microscopy. RNA sequencing, immunocytochemistry, quantitative PCR and western blotting were used to elucidate associated signaling mechanisms. Porcine cartilage and human OA cartilage explants were collected. Human articular cartilage samples were obtained from ten donors. Anterior cruciate ligament transection surgery was performed to induce OA in male C57BL/6J mice. The therapeutic effects of EPA and activation of associated signaling were evaluated using histology, immunohistochemistry and micro-computed tomography. EPA reduced F-actin intensity and Young’s modulus in IL-1α-treated porcine chondrocytes and in human OA chondrocytes. Mechanistically, EPA inhibited IL-1α-induced increase in CD44 expression in porcine chondrocytes by suppressing phosphorylation of NF-κB subunits p65. In addition, EPA alleviated articular cartilage degeneration and decreased the expression of p-p65 and CD44 in IL-1α-treated porcine and human OA cartilage explants. Moreover, EPA suppressed the increase in Young’s modulus induced by CD44 ligands (A6 peptide and low-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid) in porcine chondrocytes. Finally, intraarticular injection of EPA emulsion-integrated hyaluronic acid injection attenuated OA-associated alterations in articular cartilage and subchondral bone and decreased CD44 expression in mice. Our data not only provide new insights into EPA’s chondroprotective actions and underlying mechanisms but also offer new evidence supporting the therapeutic efficacy of a novel EPA emulsion-integrated hyaluronic acid injection for OA treatment.",

    "abstract": "RNA modifications add a crucial layer to gene expression regulation, though the roles of many RNA modification-related genes in cancer remain largely unexplored. Here we profile 76 RNA modification-associated genes across nine distinct types of modification (N1-methyladenosine, 5-methylcytosine,N6,2′-O-dimethyladenosine, 2′-O-dimethyladenosine,N7-methylguanosine, pseudouridine, uridylation, 2′-O-methylation,N4-acetylcytidine and adenosine-to-inosine editing) in four cancer types—breast, colon, liver and lung—through a comprehensive analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data. Our analysis identified three candidate genes with increased expression in cancer tissues, with elevated levels associated with poor survival across multiple cancer types: the 5-methylcytosine methyltransferases NSUN2 and DNMT3B and CBP20, anN7-methylguanosine binding protein. Of these, CBP20 emerged as a key candidate, with its knockdown leading to reduced cancer cell viability, apoptosis induction and G1–S cell cycle arrest. RNA sequencing further confirmed the downregulation of cell-cycle-related pathways upon CBP20 depletion. Through a signature similarity search using the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures dataset, we identified raloxifene, purpurogallin and enoxacin as pharmacological agents that mimic the effects of CBP20 knockdown.

    "abstract": "The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is an attractive target for drug development in various diseases; however, efforts to target it have been limited due to its concerning role in cancer. We previously developed KY19382 and KY19334, small molecules that inhibit the cytosolic function of CXXC-type zinc finger protein 5 (CXXC5), as safe therapeutic agents to restore the suppressed Wnt/β-catenin signaling in several intractable diseases, but the effects of these small molecules on cancer have not been determined. Here, we found that KY19382 and KY19334 inhibited the manifestation of malignant phenotype by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling of human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) cells, which was associated with suppression of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) expression. The induced expression of CDK1 and subsequent Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation were observed in human cSCC patient samples compared with normal samples, and the roles of CDK1 in cellular transformation and Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation in human cSCC cells were validated by CDK1 knockdown. Moreover, the two small molecules attenuated two-stage mouse skin carcinogenesis. Overall, KY19382 and KY19334 could be used as agents to treat cSCC and other types of cancer caused by CDK1 overexpression, as well as diseases caused by cytoplasmic accumulation of CXXC5.",

    "abstract": "Background/ObjectivesFACE-Q Craniofacial Module is a validated patient-reported outcome measure for appearance. This study aimed to assess the content validity of FACE-Q Craniofacial Module for use in patients treated for corneal anaesthesia.Subjects/MethodsThis was a qualitative, prospective observational study. Cognitive debriefing interviews were conducted with patients ≥8 years old who had surgical treatment for corneal anaesthesia at least six months before time of study. Two rounds of interviews gathered feedback on the comprehensibility, comprehensiveness, and relevance of three eye scales and checklists and four health-related quality-of-life scales. Based on the input from participants, ophthalmologists, scientists, and patient advocates, the scales and checklists were modified, then further refined.ResultsFeedback on the FACE-Q scales and checklists was obtained from 10 participants. Instructions for the scales were modified to enhance comprehensibility. Eleven items were revised for enhanced comprehensibility and relevance. Twelve items were added to enhance comprehensiveness. Four items were removed due to their irrelevance to appearance or corneal anaesthesia. Modifications to the eye and health-related quality-of-life scales were generally condition-specific and generic, respectively. A comment section was added to the end of each scale and checklist.ConclusionsThe FACE-Q demonstrates strong potential for adaptation to measure appearance outcomes in corneal anaesthesia patients. With lived expertise, clinical, and scientific input, the content validity of FACE-Q was improved for use in corneal anaesthesia patients. The modified FACE-Q is now ready for psychometric evaluation and further validation.Meeting Presentations:Poster Presentation at 2023 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Annual Meeting in New Orleans, LA, April 23-27, 2023.",

    "title": "Exploring the impact of linguistic proficiency and individual difference factors on interpreting performance among Chinese student interpreters",
    "abstract": "This study investigates the interplay between linguistic proficiency and individual difference factors—specifically, interpreting motivation, personality hardiness, self-efficacy, goal orientation, and interpreting anxiety—in shaping interpreting performance among Chinese student interpreters. Linguistic proficiency was assessed using the Interpreting Comprehensive Aptitude Test from the China Accreditation Test for Translators and Interpreters (CATTI), chosen for its relevance and established validity. Individual difference factors were measured using validated scales tailored for Chinese interpreter trainees to ensure reliability. Interpreting performance was evaluated through the CATTI Interpreting Practice Test, providing a standardized measure of practical skills. A cohort of 64 Chinese undergraduate interpreting students participated, a sample size consistent with similar studies, though it may limit broad generalizability. Pearson correlation analyses revealed significant correlations between interpreting performance and both linguistic proficiency (r= 0.711) and individual difference factors, except for goal orientation, with interpreting motivation (r= 0.696) and anxiety (r= −0.708) showing strong associations. Multiple regression analyses identified linguistic proficiency, interpreting motivation, and interpreting anxiety as significant predictors of performance. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that linguistic proficiency moderated the anxiety-performance relationship, with higher proficiency mitigating anxiety’s negative impact. These findings underscore the complex interaction between linguistic skills and individual difference factors in interpreting, suggesting that interpreter training programs should integrate targeted language enhancement with strategies for boosting motivation and managing anxiety, such as diverse interpreting scenarios and stress management techniques. This study emphasizes the need for a holistic approach in interpreter education that addresses both linguistic and individual difference aspects of performance, providing insights for educators and program developers.",

    "abstract": "To achieve the goals of “carbon peaking and carbon neutrality” and promote high-quality economic development, China is vigorously developing new energy and strategic emerging industries. Based on the enterprises, customs trade data from 2000 to 2022, this study applies kernel density estimation, standard deviation ellipse, and spatial Durbin model to discuss the battery electric vehicle (BEV) industry’s spatial organization pattern in China and worldwide, along with the characteristics of its development stage and driving factors. The results demonstrated that: (1) from internal circulation (ICI), China's BEV industry’s inter-firm linkages are spatially heterogeneous, multinuclear, with increasingly indicated characteristics of “large dispersion and small agglomeration”. (2) From external circulation (ECI), the BEV industry shows notable path dependence and agglomeration effects. Upstream imports are highly dependent on lithium-rich countries. Midstream export is active, with more trade-advantage regions than trade-disadvantage regions. Downstream supply and demand are growing, and its exports are on an upward trajectory. (3) From dual circulation (DCI), the organizational structure presents a network pattern with the eastern coastal region serving as the nucleus of commodity trading. The main drivers for industrial spatial organization have progressively transformed from being policy-driven to a multi-dimensional focus on technology and market. (4) Economic development, industrial structure and technological innovation have significantly influenced the spatial distribution of China’s BEV industry and propelled the evolution of global BEV trade patterns. This research illustrates the fundamental principles regarding the spatial organization of China’s BEV industry, clarifies each region’s status within DCI, and promotes the green and low-carbonization of economic development.",

    "title": "Tracing the source of nurturing life: a hermeneutic interpretation of Zhuangzi’s “Essence of Nurturing Life”",
    "abstract": "This study addresses a critical gap in Daoist scholarship by revisiting the concept of “nurturing life” (養生) inZhuangzi: Essence of Nurturing Life, an idea often reduced to either medical pragmatism or mystical abstraction in contemporary interpretations. In light of rising global interest in holistic wellness, psychological resilience, and existential balance, this paper argues that Zhuangzi offers a philosophically rigorous and spiritually embodied model of life cultivation, distinct from both Confucian moralism and biomedical reductionism. Using hermeneutic textual analysis grounded in Daoist metaphysics, the study examines central parables, including Cook Ding, the marsh pheasant, and the Right Master, to uncover how Zhuangzi integrates physical finitude with intuitive freedom. The analysis also traces the philological evolution of 養生 across classical texts, such asShuowen Jiezi,Zuo Zhuan,Mencius, and theDao De Jing, revealing how Zhuangzi reconfigures the term from a ritual or ethical duty toward an existential alignment with the Dao. Rather than presenting nurturing life as a strategy for longevity, Zhuangzi frames it as a dynamic interplay between moderation, spontaneity, and self-acceptance. His view emphasizes attunement over control, serenity over striving, and resonance with natural rhythms over rigid prescriptions. This vision is further contextualized through comparative reference to IndianPurusharthaand contemporary philosophies of flourishing. The findings position Zhuangzi not merely as a voice from antiquity, but as a relevant interlocutor in current discourses on health, meaning, and the art of living.",

    "title": "Spatial spillover effect of multi-dimensional poverty in Malawi",
    "abstract": "High and persistent levels of multidimensional poverty pose a significant challenge in Malawi. Finding effective methods to eradicate poverty in all its forms remains a key policy concern. Economic and human geographical theories suggest that poverty persists due to spatial dependence and the resulting neighbourhood or spillover effects; the level of multidimensional poverty in one area is affected by that in neighbouring areas. This study investigated the spatial patterns of multidimensional poverty in Malawi using data from the 2019 Integrated Household Survey. Using the Alkire-Foster method, a local multidimensional poverty index was constructed based on the needs and characteristics of Malawi. This research employs a spatial lag model to determine whether poverty levels in a cluster influence neighbouring areas. Results show that as of 2019/2020, 61% of individuals in Malawi lived in multidimensional poverty. On average, those affected experienced deprivation in 51% of the weighted indicators. The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) was lower in urban areas (0.148) compared to rural areas (0.342). Key findings reveal the significant spatial dependence of multidimensional poverty, indicating that poverty clusters geographically. Importantly, increased education in one area is correlated with reduced poverty in surrounding areas. Additionally, climate shocks do not only increase multidimensional poverty in the directly impacted clusters but they have ripple effects on neibhouring clusters. These results suggest that targeted anti-poverty interventions, particularly educational investments in poverty hotspots, could effectively reduce poverty in Malawi.",

    "title": "Combined blood pressure and pulse rate as a new risk marker for mortality in hemodialysis patients",
    "abstract": "Hemodialysis patients have a significantly higher rate of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality compared with the general population. Although cardiovascular mortality among hemodialysis patients is lower in Japan than in the United States and Europe, the absolute number remains high [1]. Hypertension is recognized as a key predictor of clinical outcomes among several factors, such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, and smoking habits. High blood pressure is common in hemodialysis patients, occurring in 60–90% of cases [2]. The pathology and management of hypertension in hemodialysis patients differ from those in the general population, as the primary cause involves inadequate control of volume expansion [3]. Moreover, sympathetic overactivity, activation of the renin-angiotensin system, and the use of drugs such as erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), could contribute to elevated blood pressure. An increase in blood pressure leads to cardiovascular remodeling, promoting cardiovascular events. In addition to hypertension, hypotension is associated with an increased mortality risk in hemodialysis patients. Patients with low blood pressure have a poor prognosis, as it predisposes them to impaired fluid removal and congestive heart failure. During dialysis, a sudden drop in blood pressure reduces organ and tissue perfusion, including coronary and cerebral blood flow. Therefore, a “U-shaped” non-linear association has been observed between blood pressure and mortality in hemodialysis patients [4], whereas this has not been the case in those undergoing peritoneal dialysis, indicating that dialysis modality influences the relationship between blood pressure and mortality. Although meta-analyses have shown that antihypertensive drugs reduce cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients [5], the optimal blood pressure target remains unknown. Conversely, the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline recommends targeting a systolic blood pressure below 120 mm Hg in patients with hypertension and CKD [6], although no lower limit has been defined. Thus, blood pressure management in dialysis patients may require a different approach [7]. In addition to blood pressure, pulse rate is another key physiological parameter in hemodialysis patients. Iseki et al. demonstrated that pulse rate is also associated with cardiovascular mortality in this population [8]. Compared to the reference pulse rate (60–69 bpm), mortality is highest in those with a pre-hemodialysis pulse rate of 110–129 bpm. Multiple factors have been proposed as causes of tachycardia in hemodialysis patients, including autonomic imbalance, sympathetic activation, and reduced vagal tone [8]. For assessing blood pressure and pulse rate, the double product (rate-pressure product [RPP]) is commonly used, as it correlates well with myocardial oxygen consumption. A recent study revealed that high RPP correlated with increased mortality and cardiovascular mortality in non-dialysis CKD patients with hypertension [9]. After adjustment, high nighttime RPP was significantly associated with higher all-cause mortality (HR, 4.978 [95% CI, 2.205–11.240]) compared with low RPP, independent of systolic blood pressure and pulse rate. In this issue, Joki et al. analyzed data obtained from the nationwide cohort study conducted in hemodialysis patients in Japan and found that a combined pre-dialysis systolic blood pressure and pulse rate category model provided a better fit for predicting 1-year all-cause and cardiovascular mortality than either the SBP and PR category model or the RPP [10]. Compared to the reference group (SBP 140–160 mmHg, PR 60–70 bpm), both higher and lower SBP (U-shaped relationship), as well as higher PR, correlated with increased risk of mortality. Regarding the potential factors that may distinguish patients with CKD from those on hemodialysis, the present study suggests that relying solely on RPP may overlook high-risk patients with lower BP and higher pulse rates. Adequate sympathetic nervous system activation is essential for maintaining blood pressure during hemodialysis. Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction may cause precipitous intradialytic BP drop, leading to hypotension, a well-known risk factor of mortality in hemodialysis patients [11]. Atrial fibrillation, as noted by the authors, may also contribute to this phenomenon. Atrial fibrillation is associated with increased mortality and hospitalization in hemodialysis patients and the general population [12]. The patients with lower BP and higher PR appeared to have a higher prevalence of arterial fibrillation than those with other categories (Tables 1 and 2) [10]. Regarding BP, a lower SBP was a mortality risk factor in older patients or those with diabetes or coronary artery disease, while higher SBP was a risk factor in younger patients [13]. Tachycardia in hemodialysis patients may reflect poor nutritional status and sympathetic overactivity, whereas hypotension may indicate congestive heart failure and severe malnutrition [14]. Therefore, it is essential to identify the clinical characteristics of patients with lower BP and higher PR and explore appropriate interventions. Although pre-dialysis BP is easy to measure, its correlation with ABPM is relatively weak, [15], and treatment based on pre-dialysis BP has been unsuccessful [16]. Much of the data linking BP to mortality in hemodialysis patients is based on in-center, pre- and post-dialysis BP values; however, intradialytic SBP has been found to have a stronger and more consistent association with mortality [17]. Therefore, the timing of BP measurement could be critical in predicting all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients. This study did not examine diurnal variation in dialysis patients, warranting further research. The present study showed that the combined pre-dialysis SBP and PR category model more accurately predicts all-cause and cardiovascular mortality than SBP, PR, or RPP alone. The effects of both high and low BP and high PR are multifactorial, likely involving various mechanisms and organ damage (Fig.1). Further investigation is necessary to optimize blood pressure control and improve the prognosis among hemodialysis patients.Fig. 1Combined systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse rate (PR) as a predictor of 1-year mortality in hemodialysis patients.Patients were categorized into 48 groups based on SBP and PR combinations. Both low SBP and high PR were independently associated with increased mortality, and their combination showed the strongest risk. This suggests that simultaneous assessment of SBP and PR may improve prognostic accuracy compared to either parameter aloneFull size image Goodkin DA, Young EW, Kurokawa K, Prütz K-G, Levin NW.

    "abstract": "Hypertension (HTN), a major contributor to cardiovascular diseases, is linked to ambient air pollution and residential greenness. However, their joint associations remain unclear. This research focuses on assessing the individual and joint associations of ambient air pollution and residential greenness on HTN among Northwestern Chinese adults. In this cross-sectional analysis, 4,214,199 participants in Northwestern China were included. HTN was assessed via standardized assessment protocols. Air pollutant concentrations were estimated via the Space-Time Extra-Trees model, and greenness was assessed through the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Generalized regression models were employed to assess the individual and joint effects of air pollutants and residential greenness on HTN. The prevalence of HTN was 20.43%. The adjusted odd ratio of HTN for each 10 µg/m3increase in PM1, PM2.5, PM10 and SO2 were 1.571 (95% CI: 1.556–1.585), 1.070 (95% CI: 1.068–1.072), 1.021 (95% CI: 1.020–1.021) and 1.798 (95% CI: 1.770–1.827), each 0.1-unit increase in NDVI were 0.943 (95% CI: 0.940–0.946) respectively. The negative association of residential greenness with HTN appeared to weaken at higher concentrations of air pollutants. Mediation analysis indicated that body mass index (BMI) partially mediated the effects of both air pollutants and NDVI on HTN risk. Our findings reveal that air pollutants are positively correlated with HTN, while residential greenness shows a negative association. However, this negative association is attenuated at higher concentrations of air pollutants. Additionally, the associations of air pollutants and residential greenness with HTN appear partially mediated by BMI",

    "abstract": "Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) studies for high altitude (HA) hypertensive patients are limited. We aimed to explore the hypertension phenotypes, and investigate their associations with hemoglobin in untreated hypertensives permanently living in HA. A total of 342 untreated hypertensive patients were included. Among the whole population, 91.80% had sustained hypertension (SH). In patients with SH, the proportions of isolated daytime hypertension, isolated nocturnal hypertension, and day-night hypertension were 2.87%, 2.87%, and 94.26%, respectively. Compared to patients with hemoglobin ≥16 g/dL, those with hemoglobin <16 g/dL had higher nocturnal average systolic blood pressure (SBP) (140.33 ± 17.46 vs. 136.26 ± 17.55 mmHg,P= 0.03) and a greater proportion of patients with nocturnal SBP fall<10% (55.00% vs. 43.30%,P= 0.03). Bivariate correlation analysis showed that hemoglobin was negatively correlated with the nocturnal average SBP (r= −0.145,P< 0.01) and was positively related to the nocturnal SBP fall (r= 0.136,P= 0.01). We found that the threshold effect value between hemoglobin and nocturnal blood pressure indices was 16 g/dL. The effect value between hemoglobin and nocturnal average SBP was −3.60 (−5.46, −1.74) for hemoglobin <16 g/dL and 0.88 (−1.07, 2.83) for hemoglobin ≥16 g/dL. Correspondingly, the effect values between hemoglobin and nocturnal SBP fall were 1.53 (0.61, 2.45) and −0.26 (−1.23, 0.70). In addition, hemoglobin was independently correlated with the above-mentioned nocturnal blood pressure indices in those with hemoglobin <16 g/dL. In conclusion, nocturnal hypertension was a prevalent ABPM phenotype in HA hypertensive patients. In those with hemoglobin levels <16 g/dL, hemoglobin concentration shows a significant inverse correlation with nocturnal SBP, suggesting that lower hemoglobin levels may warrant enhanced evaluation of nocturnal BP in this population.",

We retrospectively assessed 721 women at 11 institutions. All participants had singleton pregnancies and delivered at ≥22 gestational weeks. They were diagnosed with preeclampsia (excluding superimposed preeclampsia) after 20 gestational weeks and had results from a spot urine protein/creatinine ratio test at delivery. The severe proteinuria significantly increased the frequency of preterm delivery in the both women of severe and nonsevere hypertension (72.3% vs. 49.9%, 57.5% vs. 24.8%,p< 0.001, respectively). In the nonsevere hypertension and severe proteinuria group comparison with the severe hypertension and nonsevere proteinuria group, the frequency of women with pulmonary edema/pleural effusion onset was significantly higher (15.0% vs. 5.8%,p= 0.041) and the median serum albumin was significantly lower (2.6 g/dL vs. 2.8 g/dL,p< 0.001). Furthermore, the serum albumin was the laboratory findings with the highest relationship to u-P/C ratio at delivery. Women with preeclampsia with severe hypoalbuminemia had a significant high risk of developing severe proteinuria and pulmonary edema/pleural effusion at delivery than those without severe hypoalbuminemia, respectively. However, severe hypoalbuminemia was not the risk factor for severe hypertension in women with preeclampsia. Women with preeclampsia with severe proteinuria would have worse maternal outcome (pulmonary edema and/or pleural effusion induced by hypoalbuminemia) than those with severe hypertension. In conclusion, obstetricians should be aware of the risk of maternal pulmonary edema/pleural effusion in cases of preeclampsia with nonsevere hypertension with severe proteinuria.",

    "abstract": "This pooled subanalysis of five multicenter, prospective, open-label, single-arm studies on esaxerenone aimed to evaluate the efficacy, organ-protective effects, and safety of esaxerenone in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), with and without concomitant sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) therapy. In total, 283 and 279 patients were included in the safety (with SGLT2i, 148; without, 135) and full analysis sets (with SGLT2i; 145; without, 134), respectively. Significant changes in morning home systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) from baseline to Week 12 were shown in the overall population (mean change: −11.9/−5.2 mmHg, bothP< 0.001) and both SGLT2i and non-SGLT2i subgroups (−11.3/−4.8 and −12.5/−5.7 mmHg, respectively, allP< 0.001). Similar findings were observed in bedtime home and office SBP/DBP. The proportions of patients who achieved target home SBP/DBP < 135/85 mmHg were 71.2% (overall population) and 70.5% and 71.9% in the SGLT2i and non-SGLT2i subgroups, respectively. The urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio significantly improved from baseline to Week 12 in the overall population and SGLT2i subgroups (percentage change in geometric mean from baseline: −42.8%, −43.0%, and −42.6%, respectively, allP< 0.001). N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels improved in all groups. The incidence of serum potassium ≥5.5 mEq/L was 2.0% vs 5.2% in the SGLT2i vs non-SGLT2i subgroups. Esaxerenone demonstrated significant BP-lowering effects, and improved renal and cardiovascular parameters, regardless of SGLT2i use. Safety was consistent across groups, with the numerically lower incidence of serum potassium ≥5.5 mEq/L in the SGLT2i subgroup suggesting a potential mitigating effect of SGLT2is on the risk of hyperkalemia.",

    "abstract": "Few high-latitude archaeological contexts are older than marine isotope stage (MIS) 15 and even fewer provide evidence of early human occupation during a glacial period. New discoveries at Old Park, Canterbury (UK), provide evidence of both the oldest accessible artefact-bearing sediment in northern Europe and cold-stage adaptation. Radiometric and palaeomagnetic dating places the earliest suggested occupation of this site between 773 thousand years ago (ka) and 607 ka, with hominin presence inferred during MIS 17–16. Two additional artefact-bearing stratigraphic units, dated to around 542 ka and 437 ka, strongly align with the MIS 14 and 12 cold stages, respectively. The latter unit contains convincing evidence of glacial-stage occupation by Acheulean hominins; fresh, unabraded flakes (including biface-thinning) between clearly defined glacial-aged sediments displaying mixed grassland palaeoenvironmental evidence. An historically collected assemblage of more than 330 handaxes is argued to be derived from both the MIS 17–16 and MIS 12 sediments, providing evidence of the earliest known Acheulean bifaces in northern Europe, and re-occupation by Acheulean populations 200,000 years later. Together, Old Park provides evidence for Lower Palaeolithic hominins reoccupying a location over several mid-Pleistocene MIS cycles, early human presence above 51° latitude during a glacial stage and handaxe production in northern Europe from MIS 17 to 16.",

Although the migration of lithium cations is known to induce phase transition from α-phase to δ-phase in perovskites, reports of long-term device stability present apparent contradictions. Here we show that, under dark/light alternating conditions, lithium migration induces a rapid degradation of the α-phase perovskite. This degradation is not observed under continuous light-only or dark-only conditions commonly used within the field to test the devices. To address the instability under dark/light cycling, we replace the lithium dopant with a methylammonium dopant. Importantly, we show no unreacted methylammonium dopant in the hole-transport layer film different to the lithium dopant, hinting at a better device stability. We achieve an efficiency of 26.1% (25.6% certified) andT95lifetimes (that is, time for the device efficiency to decay to 95% of its initial value) of over 1,200 h of continuous light–dark cycling (ISOS-LC-1 certified) and 3,000 voltage-on/off cycles, conditions that are relevant to real-world operation.",

The field has shown that human mobility is scale-free, proposed models to generate scale-free moving distance distributions and explained how the scale-free distribution arises. It has not, however, explicitly addressed how mobility is structured by geographical constraints, such as how mobility relates to the outlines of landmasses, lakes and rivers and the placement of buildings, roadways and cities. On the basis of millions of moves, we show how separating the effect of geography from mobility choices reveals a power law spanning five orders of magnitude. To do so, we incorporate geography via the pair distribution function, which encapsulates the structure of locations on which mobility occurs. By showing how the spatial distribution of human settlements shapes human mobility, our approach bridges the gap between distance- and opportunity-based models of human mobility.",

Selective T-ALL targeting is challenging due to the shared antigen expression between leukemic and normal T cells. Here we identify the pre-T cell receptor (pre-TCR), a surface receptor essential for T cell development, as a biomarker of leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) in human T-ALL. Loss-of-function genetic approaches demonstrate that pre-TCR signaling is necessary for LIC activity and tumor progression in pre-TCR+T-ALL patient xenografts in mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate the specific therapeutic targeting of the pre-TCR with a monoclonal antibody against the invariant pTα subunit of the human pre-TCR, and validate an anti-pTα antibody–drug conjugate in vivo treatment as a potent immunotherapy for inhibiting LIC activity and tumor progression of T-ALL in mice. These findings reveal the suitability of pre-TCR targeting as a promising therapy for the treatment of individuals with relapsed/refractory T-ALL expressing the pre-TCR.",

Despite clinical advances in the hepatic delivery of mRNA using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), current strategies for extrahepatic-organ-selective mRNA delivery still have limitations. Here we report a peptide-encoded organ-selective targeting (POST) method for the delivery of mRNA to extrahepatic organs after systemic administration, which is based on the modular tuning of LNPs through surface engineering with specific amino acid sequences (POST codes). Molecular dynamics simulations and in vitro and in vivo testing show that the organ-selective targeting of POST results from the specific protein corona of the peptide-decorated LNPs, which is established from the mechanical optimization of the binding affinities between peptides with a particular sequence and plasma proteins. This approach can be used for the organ-selective delivery of different ribonucleic acids and multiple gene editing machinery. Overall, the POST platform creates a modular repertoire for LNP surface engineering for directing organ tropism, broadening the scope and versatility of organ-selective delivery.",

Structure–activity and structure–selectivity relationship analyses enable us to obtain a general and predictable strategy for peptide ionizable lipid design. By incorporating artificial ionizable and natural amino acids and/or functional molecules into peptide ionizable lipids, we create lipid nanoparticles with tissue-specific targeting, including the lungs, liver, spleen, thymus and bone. In particular, lipid nanoparticles containing peptide lipids targeting the liver show comparable efficacy and safety compared with FDA-approved formulations. Furthermore, lipid nanoparticles with peptide lipids achieve the efficient co-delivery of PEmax mRNA and engineered prime editing guide RNA for prime editing of the liver and lungs.

    "title": "An umbrella review of neuroimaging studies and conceptual framework linking pathophysiology and psychopathology in schizophrenia",
    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic psychotic syndrome with elusive neurobiological underpinnings, partly owing to heterogeneity and inconsistency of existing data. Here, to address this, we conduct an umbrella review of meta-analyses of neuroimaging studies to identify the most consistent brain alterations in schizophrenia. A systematic PubMed search (until October 2022) identified 50 articles reporting high-resolution neuroimaging meta-analyses examining brain structure and function—gray matter, white matter, intrinsic activity and task-based activation—by comparing brain alterations between individuals with prodromal symptoms or schizophrenia (distinguishing early and chronic stages) and healthy controls, or by correlating brain alterations with schizophrenia symptoms. The synthesis uncovers a core spatiotemporal set of brain alterations. The prodromal stage shows gray matter deficits in midline structures (especially the medial prefrontal cortex), alongside central executive network dysfunction. The first-episode/early psychosis stage features additional gray matter damage to the operculum (insula, superior temporal gyrus and adjacent cortices) and white matter disruptions in fronto-temporal regions near the lateral ventricles (affecting the fornix, cingulum and long-range fasciculi), alongside default-mode network dysfunction. The chronic/deteriorative stage involves widespread alterations, prominently affecting the thalamus and lateral prefrontal cortex. Damage to opercular areas (especially the superior temporal gyrus/auditory cortex) correlates with auditory hallucinations, while default-mode network dysfunction correlates with delusions and hallucinations. These alterations may be limited to prototypical schizophrenia. Integrating these findings, we developed a conceptual framework that links the spatiotemporal pattern of brain alterations to pathophysiology and psychopathology, forming the basis for a working model of schizophrenia.",

Transcriptional analysis in intestinal epithelial cells of ATF6 transgenic mice (nATF6IEC) identifies bacteria-specific changes in cellular metabolism enriched for fatty acid biosynthesis. Untargeted metabolomics and isotype labelling confirm ATF6-related enrichment of long-chain fatty acids in colonic tissue of humans, mice and organoids. FASN inhibition and microbiota transfer in germ-free nATF6IECmice confirm the causal involvement of ATF6-induced lipid alterations in tumorigenesis. The selective expansion of tumour-relevant microbial taxa, includingDesulfovibrio fairfieldensis, is mechanistically linked to long-chain fatty acid exposure using bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging, and growth analysis ofDesulfovibrioisolates. We postulate chronic ATF6 signalling to select for tumour-promoting microbiota by altering lipid metabolism.",

However, only with the advent of ribosome profiling was the broad scale and complexity of translated regions fully appreciated.Recent interest in pervasive translation has exposed a lack of general terminology for translated regions that does not depend on the properties of their products or their sequence. In the absence of such terminology, a range of inconsistently defined terms are used to describe them. These terms are typically variations on ‘open reading frame’ (ORF) — for example, non-canonical ORF (ncORF), RiboSeq ORF, alternative ORF (altORF), translated ORF (tORF), small ORF (smORF), short ORF (sORF) and others. Such terms largely overlap and redundantly describe the same core concept: that the region in question is translated.",

    "abstract": "A critical component of optical communications is the availability of a suitable waveguide technology for the transport of electromagnetic waves with low loss over a broad spectral range. In the past four decades, despite extensive research, the attenuation and spectral bandwidth of silica-based optical fibres have remained relatively unchanged, with state-of-the-art fibres offering values of 0.14 dB km−1and 26 THz below 0.2 dB km−1, respectively. Here we report a microstructured optical waveguide with unprecedented transmission bandwidth and attenuation, with a measured loss of 0.091 dB km−1at 1,550 nm that remains below 0.2 dB km−1over a window of 66 THz. Instead of a traditional solid glass core, this innovative optical fibre features a core of air surrounded by a meticulously engineered glass microstructure to guide light. This approach not only reduces attenuation and other signal degradation phenomena, but it also increases transmission speeds by 45%. Furthermore, the approach theoretically supports further loss reductions and operation at wavelengths where broader bandwidth amplifiers exist, potentially heralding a new era in long-distance communications as well as remote delivery of laser beams.",

Here we explore the impact of filamentous fungi on multiphase flow and fluid redistribution using a dual-porosity microfluidic chip, featuring a flow channel embedded within tight porous media. Our pore-scale visualizations show that filamentous fungi can actively induce multiphase flow and mobilize trapped fluid phases in porous media through localized clogging and hyphal-induced pore invasion, enhancing the oil–water interfacial area and redistribution of fluid phases.

Mapping of NL interactions in these rearrangements revealed that, in mouse embryonic stem cells, a single LAD contacts the NL through multiple regions that act cooperatively or redundantly; some have more affinity for the NL than others and can pull neighboring sequences to the NL. Genes drawn toward the NL showed often but not always reduced expression and increased H3K9me3 levels. Furthermore, neighboring LADs can cooperatively interact with the NL when placed close enough to each other.

This enhances the cross-coupling reaction between *CO and *CHxspecies favouring ethanol production, as opposed to the conventional *CO dimerization pathway that primarily yields ethylene. Using a set of in situ spectroscopic techniques, we show that the addition of lead to copper catalysts expedites the generation of *OCHxspecies and increases the coverage of *CHxspecies, thereby enhancing their coupling with *CO and improving ethanol production, in agreement with our theoretical predictions.",

    "title": "A colloidal approach for the synthesis of catalytically active solid–liquid–solid nanoparticles",
    "abstract": "Nanoreactors can synthesize highly tunable nanomaterials beyond the reach of conventional methods. Liquid metals (LMs) have emerged as an interesting reaction medium for materials synthesis. However, the limited understanding of their chemistry at the nanoscale has so far hindered the broader exploration of LMs in the synthesis of nanomaterials. Here we advance the chemistry of LM nanoparticles (NPs) and demonstrate the use of these NPs as nanoreactors to access well-defined, compositionally tunable multimetallic NPs. We propose a colloidal approach to synthesize solid–liquid–solid core–shell–shell NPs in which a solid metal core (silver, gold, copper or palladium) is embedded into a liquid gallium NP surrounded by its native oxide skin. Using state-of-the-art characterization, we observe the dissolution and recrystallization of the solid metal core within the liquid gallium NP during the synthesis. We leverage this understanding to access unprecedented multimetallic NPs, exemplified by Ag–Au nanodimers within a liquid gallium shell. Finally, we show that solid–liquid–solid NPs are promising electrocatalysts with improved structural stability over the solid core only.",

    "title": "NeuroD1 drives a KAT2A-FDFT1 signaling axis to promote cholesterol biosynthesis and hepatocellular carcinoma progression via histone H3K27 acetylation",
    "abstract": "Abnormal lipid metabolism is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Lipid metabolic reprogramming, which has been observed in various tumors, could participate in tumor occurrence, invasion, and metastasis of tumors by regulating various carcinogenic signaling pathways. However, the molecular mechanism that regulates tumor cell lipid metabolic reprogramming has not been fully elucidated. Recent studies revealed that neurogenic differentiation factor 1 (NeuroD1) is upregulated in a variety of tumor cells, and is associated with tumorigenesis and poor prognosis. However, its role in tumor cell lipid metabolism remains unclear. Here, we found that NeuroD1 is highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and is associated with tumor cell cholesterol biosynthesis. We found that NeuroD1 enhances HCC cell cholesterol biosynthesis, leading to an increase in their viability. Mechanistically, NeuroD1 binds to the promoter offarnesyl diphosphate farnesyl transferase 1(FDFT1), thereby activating its transcription activity. Furthermore, NeuroD1 can promoteFDFT1transcription through lysine acetyltransferase 2A-mediated H3K27 acetylation. Subsequently, we found that NeuroD1/FDFT1-mediated cholesterol biosynthesis is critical to the tumorigenic potential of HCC cells. These findings not only identify NeuroD1 as a regulator of lipid metabolism in tumor cells, but also reveal a novel molecular mechanism underlying its carcinogenic function.",

    "abstract": "In this study, a novel poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) membrane modified with L-glutamic acid was synthesized using poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as a porogen to increase the surface area and improve Cu(II) adsorption. The phase separation between PVA and PEG induced pore formation, extending from the surface into the interior. PEG also acted as a plasticizer, increasing polymer chain flexibility. The effects of the PEG content on the structural and physicochemical properties were analyzed via water absorption, FT-IR, TGA, XRD, and SEM. The results showed that the incorporation of PEG significantly influenced the material properties. Additionally, adsorption, desorption, kinetic, and isotherm studies were conducted to evaluate the adsorption process. The Cu(II) adsorption capacity increased from 31.8 mg/g to 51.1 mg/g with an initial Cu(II) concentration of 95.0 mg/L. The adsorption equilibrium followed the Freundlich isotherm model, suggesting a heterogeneous surface with various adsorption sites. Kinetic analysis revealed pseudo-second-order kinetics. Desorption studies revealed efficient Cu(II) release in 2 M HNO3within 150 min, resulting in an 81.9% desorption efficiency. Thermal analysis revealed a lower degradation range (262 °C) compared to that of pure PVA (339 °C), which was attributed to the increased surface area. Additionally, the incorporation of PEG reduced the crystallinity of PVA-c-Glu/PEG. These findings highlight the potential of PEG-modified porous PVA for sustainable heavy metal removal in environmental applications.",

Recent platforms offer a robust method for quantifying gene expression within a spatial context. Here, we report spatial transcriptomic profiling from pancreas samples obtained from three donors with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and three donors with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Our analysis identified a major technical challenge: substantial transcript bleed of highly abundant genes (e.g.,INSandGCG) into adjacent tissue regions. We demonstrate that this bleed can be computationally corrected using probabilistic models. Our analysis highlights the importance of incorporating bleed-correction techniques in the preprocessing of spatial transcriptomic profiling data. In summary, this study provides a dataset, methods, and resources to investigate the spatial regulation of gene expression in normal and T2D-affected human pancreas.",

The GVI is based on an additive formula that summarizes the essence of seven major socioeconomic dimensions of vulnerability into one number. This formula approach makes it possible to compute the index for any region at any point in time for which the underlying indicators are available. We derive projections of these indicators from the SSP databases for each fifth year in the period 2020–2100. These projections are subsequently used to compute future GVI values for countries and major global regions for three SSPs: the green road scenario (SSP1), the middle of the road scenario (SSP2), and the rocky road scenario (SSP3).",

    "abstract": "Lymph node metastasis is crucial for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) malignancy. However, the molecular drivers and related mechanisms of lymph node metastasis in ESCC cells are unclear. In the present study, we found that the tyrosine kinase complex-focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/Src family kinase (SFK) axis specifically contributes to metabolic reprogramming by inducing the phosphorylation of ATP-citrate synthase (ACLY) Tyr542, Tyr652, and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A (ALDOA) Tyr174, Tyr302, or Tyr328 sites in both primary and metastatic ESCC cells. Mechanistically, activated ACLY and ALDOA and their metabolites drive a transcriptional program in primary tumors that induces cyclin-dependent kinase 7/9 (CDK7/9) complex-mediated expression of DNA replication- and cell proliferation-related molecules. This process functions as an enabler of tumor malignancy. In metastatic tumor cells, metabolic enzymes and their products facilitate the transcriptional activity of Yamanaka factors to induce the activation of downstream plasticity-related molecules, fueling ESCC cell survival within metastatic lymph nodes. FAK/SFK axis-controlled ACLY and ALDOA tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream transcription factors and effectors in primary and metastatic ESCC cells are strongly associated with poor patient outcomes. We discovered a lead compound, quercetagitrin, that inhibits the phosphorylation of ALDOA at Tyr174, 302, and 328. Moreover, it has been shown to have antitumor effects alone or in combination with FAK/SFK inhibitors both in vivo and in vitro. The inhibition of tyrosine kinase-regulated metabolic enzyme activities and related signaling networks may be a potential strategy for the treatment and diagnosis of metastatic ESCC.",

We previously developed bicarbonate-integrated TACE, termed TILA-TACE, which demonstrated 100% effectiveness for locoregional control of unresectable HCC. This study aimed to validate its efficacy, selectivity, and safety in real-world clinical practice (ChiCTR-ONC-17013416). A total of 413 patients were enrolled, including 40 (9.7%) with early-stage HCC, 29 (7.0%) with intermediate-stage HCC, and 344 (83.3%) with advanced-stage HCC. Primary tumors and macrovascular invasion/extrahepatic metastases were treated with TILA-TACE and radiation therapy, respectively. The side effects of TILA-TACE were recorded. The objective response rate of HCC tumors to TILA-TACE was 99.01%, including a complete response in 72.77% of patients. The objective response rate of tumor thrombus to radiation therapy was 96.88%. During a median follow-up of 38 months, there were 1 and 4 deaths among early- and intermediate-stage patients, respectively. The median survival of advanced-stage patients was 27 months. We found that intrahepatic metastases accounted for 70.4% (107/152) of cancer-related deaths after effective control of primary tumors and vascular invasion. The main adverse events associated with TILA-TACE were transient liver enzyme or bilirubin abnormalities (86.44% and 56.66%, respectively), which was consistent with the known side-effect profile of TACE. In conclusion, TILA-TACE is a novel and highly effective treatment for the local control of HCC with a tolerable safety profile. When combined with radiation therapy for macrovascular invasion, it offers significant survival benefits for patients with advanced HCC.",

    "abstract": "Postural instability, a concomitant of falls, can persist in people with alcohol use disorder (AUD) even with sustained sobriety. Balance testing using a force plate, which detects micromovements while standing still, can be quantified with spectral analysis and expressed as temporal frequency, an index of truncal (i.e., postural) tremor. Here, we investigated physiological and brain structural factors that may contribute to a mechanistic understanding of postural instability during quiet standing in AUD. This mixed cross-sectional/longitudinal design included 462 observations in 292 participants (age 25–75 years): 120 men and 44 women with DSM-5-determined AUD and 75 control men and 53 control women. All participants completed balance testing on a force plate under two conditions: eyes open and eyes closed, both with feet together. Most participants also underwent two-point discrimination testing on the soles of the feet and structural MRI, typically within the week of balance testing. Linear mixed-effects models revealed greater tremor in all conditions in the AUD than control group with the diagnostic differences attributed to AUD men. Age effects did not differ significantly between AUD and control groups. By contrast, stronger correlations were detected between greater tremor, measured as a 2–5 Hz/0–2 Hz frequency quotient, and smaller regional brain volumes selective to motor centers (frontal supplemental motor cortex, thalamus, pallidum, cerebellar white matter) of the AUD men. The salient signs of postural instability were attributable to AUD men who consumed alcohol exceeding NIAAA guideline limits in the year prior to testing.",

    "abstract": "Depressive cognitive impairment is seen in a significant number of patients with depression. However, it remains challenging to differentiate between patients with amnestic (those with subjective cognitive impairment complaints) and non-amnestic major depressive disorder, highlighting the urgent need for additional objective tools to help classify these patients more accurately. We analyzed cognitive state, alterations in regional entropy and functional connectivity measures of the brain between patients with major depression and healthy controls. The depressed cohort was categorized as either “amnestic” or “non-amnestic,” depending on self-reported experiences of forgetfulness. The superior temporal region and insula exhibited altered entropy and connectivity measures in individuals with depression and subjective cognitive impairment, which was correlated with impaired executive functions, a pattern not being evident in the control group. Our findings support the notion that insular and superior temporal entropic alterations are linked to subjective cognitive changes in the pathology of depression. These regions also hold potential as biomarkers for determining the underlying objective cognitive deficits in subjective cognitive complaints in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). This underscores the need for improved diagnostic approaches and the implementation of practical dynamic neuroimaging modalities capable of addressing the current challenges in diagnosing subjective cognitive impairment in MDD, offering promise for the future management of patients with depression.",

The aim of this study is to characterize the neural circuits affected by ketamine and NLX-101, a selective 5-HT1Areceptor biased agonist which has shown promising effects, by using [18F]FDG PET imaging in rats that had received chronic administration of corticosterone (CORT), a model of anxiety-depression. In a longitudinal study, regional changes in brain activity were investigated in 24 selected CORT rats. Each animal underwent PET scans in 3 conditions, i.e. with ketamine (10 mg/kg), NLX-101 (0.16 mg/kg) or saline on day 0 and five days later to assess sustained effects. The anxious-depressive phenotype produced by CORT was supported by behavioural and biological observations. Changes in [18F]FDG uptake were determined using voxel-based and region of interest analyses. Metabolic connectivity analysis was also performed to investigate the acute and delayed effects of the treatments. Voxel-based and region-of-interest analyses showed marked hypometabolism in regions implicated in depression, particularly cingulate cortex (−7%) and lateral septum (−9%) as well as the striatum (−10%). Acute effects of NLX-101 and ketamine were observed in the lateral septum, resulting in an increase in brain glucose metabolism (p < 0,05). Interestingly, connectivity analyses also showed effects of NLX-101 in the frontal cortex, the thalamus and amygdala (p < 0.05), suggesting that the two molecules converge on common brain regions. This study is the first to show brain activation patterns of RAADs in a CORT rat model by functional PET imaging. NLX-101 appears to exert antidepressant effects by preferentially activating postsynaptic 5-HT1Aheteroreceptors in primary regions common to ketamine. These results support investigation of cortical 5-HT1Areceptors as a target for new generation biased agonist antidepressants.",
