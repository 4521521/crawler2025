    "title": "A BRC1-modulated switch in auxin efflux accounts for the competition between Arabidopsis axillary buds",
    "abstract": "As part of their modular development, plants continuously adapt their shoot branching architecture according to environmental conditions. This occurs by regulating the activity of axillary buds established in each leaf axil. Whether a bud grows into a shoot depends partly on the presence of other active shoots, which can inhibit bud activation. This systemic coordination is proposed to be mediated by the transport network of the plant hormone auxin, with buds competing to establish sustained transport of auxin, termed canalized auxin transport, into the main stem. A second hormone, strigolactone, tunes this competition by influencing the removal of the PIN1 auxin export protein from the plasma membrane, and hence the dynamics of canalization. Strigolactone also regulates the expression of another key regulatory hub, the bud-expressed transcription factorBRANCHED1(BRC1). The interplay between auxin transport and BRC1 in regulating bud activity is poorly understood. Here, we investigate this interplay in the context of competition between buds, using Arabidopsis explants with two axillary buds as a minimal system. Using experimental data, we develop a mathematical model of bud-bud competition in which BRC1 influences the establishment of canalized auxin transport by regulating the basal rate of auxin efflux in buds. We identify single model parameters that plausibly correspond to the dual impact of strigolactone onBRC1expression and PIN1. We show that modulating these two parameters reproduces the dynamics of bud growth and bud-bud competition observed in relevant mutants and treatments. Our model produces testable hypotheses, which we validate by generating a chimeric PIN1 auxin transporter with impaired strigolactone sensitivity, helping us uncouple the effects of strigolactone on PIN1 and BRC1. These results support the hypothesis that BRC1 influences local bud competitiveness by downregulating the basal rate of auxin efflux in buds. Together with the systemic feedbacks in the auxin transport network, this enables plants to adjust dynamically the number and location of growing branches.",

    "title": "Why does the m6A writer complex require so many proteins?",
    "abstract": "The conversion of adenosine toN6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common internal modification made to eukaryotic mRNA and is involved in post-transcriptional control of gene expression. When dysregulated, m6A has been linked to a variety of diseases, including cancer. Unlike other RNA methyltransferases, m6A conversion is catalyzed by a multi-protein writer complex with only one catalytic subunit. So why is the m6A writer complex composed of so many proteins? This Unsolved Mystery explores the possible functions of the proteins of the m6A writer complex and discusses why it might require multiple subunits. Understanding the roles of these proteins could provide insight into how m6A is regulated and reveal new strategies for targeting diseases linked to m6A dysregulation.",

    "title": "Dynamic phosphorylation of Hcm1 promotes fitness in chronic stress",
    "abstract": "Cell survival depends upon the ability to adapt to changing environments. Environmental stressors trigger an acute stress response program that rewires cell physiology, downregulates proliferation genes and pauses the cell cycle until the cell adapts. After the acute response is resolved, cells resume cycling but at a reduced rate. The importance of cell cycle changes for survival in chronic stress is not clear. Here, we show that dynamic phosphorylation of the yeast cell cycle-regulatory transcription factor Hcm1 is required to maintain fitness in chronic stress. Hcm1 is activated by cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) during S-phase and is inactivated by the phosphatase calcineurin (CN) in response to stressors that signal through increases in cytosolic Ca2+. Cells expressing a constitutively active, phosphomimetic Hcm1 mutant exhibit a reduction in fitness in stress, suggesting Hcm1 inactivation promotes survival. However, a comprehensive analysis of Hcm1 phosphomutants revealed that Hcm1 activity is also important to survive stress, and that all mutants with fixed phosphorylation states are less fit in stress. Moreover, our data suggests that pulses of Hcm1 activity are necessary to maximize target gene expression in stress. These findings demonstrate that expression levels of Hcm1 target genes influence fitness in stress and suggest that the dynamic phosphorylation of cell cycle regulators plays a crucial role in promoting survival in stressful environments.",

    "title": "Parallel regulatory circuits orchestrate biofilm formation in response to c-di-GMP levels and growth phase",
    "abstract": "Biofilm formation is a highly regulated process that contributes to the environmental fitness of microorganisms, including pathogenic bacteria. The second messenger c-di-GMP is a critical regulator of biofilm formation whose cellular levels are tightly regulated by the abundance and activity of diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) and phosphodiesterases (PDEs). These enzymes synthesize and degrade c-di-GMP, respectively. TheVibrio choleraeVpvABC system encodes a DGC and is critical for biofilm formation; however, much remains unknown about its regulation. Here we demonstrate that thevpvABCsystem is transcriptionally regulated by c-di-GMP and the master biofilm regulators VpsT and VpsR. However, we also identify the alternative sigma factor RpoS as a positive regulator ofvpvABC. RpoS is involved in the regulation of many c-di-GMP metabolism genes and plays a role in biofilm architecture, likely mediated in part throughvpvC. In mature biofilms,vpvAtranscription was highest near the biofilm substratum and VpsT, VpsR, and RpoS were critical forvpvABCtranscription. Overall, our genetic dissection reveals thevpvABCsystem is regulated by two parallel circuits: a c-di-GMP sensing-circuit acting through VpsT and VpsR and a stationary growth phase circuit via RpoS. These findings underscore the multilayered regulatory mechanisms that precisely govern biofilm formation by a pathogen.",

    "abstract": "The gonad ofCaenorhabditis eleganshermaphrodites is a longstanding model of cell migration, stem cell niche function, and organogenesis, but it has not yet been investigated using single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq). Using a recently published scRNA-seq dataset of adultC. eleganshermaphrodites, we identified a previously unknown regulator of the leader cell of gonad migration (the distal tip cell, or DTC). The genemig-21is both highly and specifically expressed in the DTC, yet has no known role in that cell. However,mig-21regulates cell migration in other developmental contexts. Using classical genetics techniques, RNAi knockdown, and live cell imaging, we discovered thatmig-21acts synergistically with the Wnt and Netrin pathways to guide anteroposterior and dorsoventral phases of migration in the DTC at the level of signaling, not DTC cell structure. Known interactors ofmig-21in other cell types–like PTP-3C–also act with MIG-21 in DTC migration. Despite its expression in stationary adult DTCs,mig-21does not play a role in the cessation of DTC migration but instead seems to impart continued sensitivity of the DTC to Wnt and Netrin in adulthood. This study reveals additional complexity of signaling integration between major regulators of germline stem cell niche migration, and as a proof of concept it demonstrates the utility of scRNA-seq datasets in revealing testable hypotheses about genetic networks that were masked by redundancy in traditional screening methods.",

    "title": "Epigenetic relay: Polycomb-directed DNA methylation in mammalian development",
    "abstract": "In mammals, repression of germline-specific gene expression is essential for preserving somatic cell identity and preventing disease. Germline gene silencing is often dependent on the presence of promoter 5-cytosine DNA methylation (5meC). Early mammalian development, however, is marked by a dramatic loss of 5meC levels genome-wide. Recent research has highlighted a specialized variant of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1, PRC1.6, as a key regulator that maintains transient silencing of germline genes in this embryonic window. Eventually, PRC1.6 seems to stimulate the recruitment ofde novoDNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), although the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Evidence suggests a coordinated epigenetic relay, potentially involving direct protein interactions and shaping the local histone modification landscape. This review explores PRC1.6 as a central epigenetic hub that connects Polycomb repression, histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation, and DNA methylation pathways. Unraveling this interplay will provide key insights into the mechanisms that maintain the critical barrier between the germline and the soma, essential not only for proper development but also for preserving somatic cell function and health throughout life.",

Our investigation revealed the existence of four distinct transcriptional subtypes of ovarian cancer: immunoreactive, mesenchymal, proliferative, and differentiated, which is comparable to those of TCGA HGSOC transcriptional subgroups. Each subtype exhibited unique correlation networks and their immune cell composition was computationally determined. Notably, the immunoreactive cluster displayed the highest immune score, even in the context of pan solid-cancer types, accompanied by heightened expression of CD4+and CD8+T cells (P< 0.05), along with notable associations with neutrophil degranulation and antigen presentation pathways (FDR < 0.01). Conversely, the differentiated cluster demonstrated immunodepleted characteristics, featuring an elevated proportion of overexpressed cancer-germline antigens. We also identified several cancer-germline HGSOC antigens that could be further investigated as potential targets for immunological intervention in cancer.",

    "abstract": "The long non-coding RNA lnc-FANCI-2 acts as a host defense RNA and is highly expressed in HPV-positive cervical lesions. Its activation relies on the binding of the transcription factor YY1 to two conserved motifs in its promoter. We used DNA oligo pull-down combined with mass spectrometry to identify proteins binding to the lnc-FANCI-2 promoter, discovering new TFAP2 family members that compete with YY1 for binding at overlapping sites. In primary epithelial cells, TFAP2 binding led to lnc-FANCI-2 silencing. However, in HPV-positive cancer cells, increased YY1 levels displaced TFAP2, alleviating repression. Genome-wide predictions using the JASPAR database identified thousands of YY1 and TFAP2 competition binding sites (CBSs), many overlapping with CHIP-seq peaks for YY1, TFAP2A, and TFAP2C, predominantly in promoter regions. We validated competition at two CBSs in the promoter and found it likely regulates cancer-related genes PPP1R15B and LRRC37A. This suggests that YY1 and TFAP2 competition might influence a broader transcriptional regulation network in HPV-induced cancer. This study reveals a novel transcriptional antagonism mechanism affecting lnc-FANCI-2 and other cancer-related genes, highlighting YY1 and TFAP2 as potential therapeutic targets in HPV-driven carcinogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila, the causative agent of Legionnaires’ disease, exists ubiquitously in natural and artificial water systems. This pathogen poses serious threat to human health. One salient feature ofL. pneumophilapathogenesis is the hundreds of effectors delivered into host cells by its Dot/Icm transporter. These virulence factors interfere with multiple hosts signaling pathways to subvert host defense. The ubiquitin network is essential in host signaling involved in immunity and thus is a common target ofL. pneumophilaeffectors. At least thirteen Dot/Icm effectors have been shown to function as E3 ubiquitin ligases that cooperate with the host ubiquitination machinery by distinct mechanisms. In addition, seven deubiquitinases (DUBs) have been characterized. Furthermore, effectors that utilize catalysis mechanisms that are chemically distinct from the canonical one found in eukaryotes have been reported, indicating that hijacking of the host ubiquitin network byL. pneumophilais extensive and complex. Here, we identified ubiquitin interacting proteins with a proximity labeling method and found that the effector Lug14 (Lpg1106) functions as a novel ubiquitin ligase. Lug14 works with the E2 UbcH5c to catalyze ubiquitination with a preference for K11-linked chains by a mechanism that does not require a cysteine residue. Finally, we found that Lug14 targets ARIH2, a member of the host RBR E3 ligase family, leading to increased activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages.",

    "abstract": "The Tripartite Attachment Complex (TAC) is essential for mitochondrial DNA (kDNA) segregation inTrypanosoma brucei, providing a physical link between the flagellar basal body and the mitochondrial genome. Although the TAC’s hierarchical assembly and linear organization have been extensively studied, much remains to be discovered regarding its complete architecture and composition – for instance, our identification of a new TAC component underscores these knowledge gaps. Here, we use a combination of proteomics, RNA interference (RNAi), and Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (U-ExM) to characterize the TAC at high resolution and identify a novel component, TAC53 (Tb927.2.6100). Depletion of TAC53 in both procyclic and bloodstream forms results in kDNA missegregation and loss, a characteristic feature of TAC dysfunction. TAC53 localizes to the kDNA in a cell cycle-dependent manner and represents the most kDNA-proximal TAC component identified to date. U-ExM reveals a previously unrecognized tubular architecture of the TAC, with two distinct TAC structures per kDNA disc, suggesting a mechanism for precise kDNA alignment and segregation. Moreover, immunoprecipitation and imaging analyses indicate that TAC53 interacts with known TAC-associated proteins HMG44, KAP68, and KAP3, forming a network at the TAC–kDNA interface. These findings redefine our understanding of TAC architecture and function and identify TAC53 as a key structural component anchoring the mitochondrial genome inT. brucei.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying insect resistance to Cry toxins produced by the soil bacteriumBacillus thuringiensis(Bt) is crucial for the sustainable utilization of Bt-based products. Previously, we identified that the reduced expression of theCAD,ABCC2andABCC3genes through a eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) is associated with Bt Cry1Ac resistance in the cotton bollworm,Helicoverpa armigera. Here, we found that an eIF2 alpha kinase, GCN2, is highly conserved in Lepidoptera insects. Its inhibitor GCN2iB (ATP-competitive inhibitor of serine/threonine protein kinase, stress-responsive kinase) could decrease the toxicity of Cry1Ac, and the GCN2 enzyme activities decreased after larvae fed Cry1Ac. The expression level of theHaGCN2gene and the enzymatic activity of its corresponding protein were significantly down-regulated in the BtR resistant strain. Moreover, both BiFC and Y2H assays demonstrated that eIF2 could interact with GCN2. Finally, the silencing ofHaGCN2expression not only decreased the protein and phosphorylation levels of eIF2α but also reduced the expression ofHaCAD,HaABCC2, andHaABCC3. This consequently led to a decrease in the toxicity of Cry1Ac towardHelicoverpa armigera. These results indicate that GCN2 conferring Cry1Ac resistance inH. armigerathrough regulating the expression of eIF2.

Intrinsic or acquired immunosuppression serves as a critical risk factor predisposing individuals to this disease, while simultaneously reducing the efficacy of conventional antifungal therapies and worsening clinical outcomes. Given the central role of immune dysfunction in the pathogenesis of invasive candidiasis, immunotherapeutic strategies hold substantial promise. We targeted dectin-1, the primary pattern recognition receptor for β-1,3-glucan, by engineering XJ104, a bispecific T-cell engager that fuses dectin-1 to the light chains of an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody. This construct is designed to bridgeCandidaβ-1,3-glucan with CD3 on T cells, thereby inducing anti-Candidaimmunity. Our results demonstrate that XJ104 exhibits high specificity for β-1,3-glucan and activates effector cells in aCandida-dependent mannerin vitro. In murine models, XJ104 enhances Th1 and Th17 responses and confers significant protection against bothC. albicansandnon-albicansinfections. Crucially, CD3+T-cell depletion and cytokine neutralization abolished this protection, confirming the T-cell-dependent protective efficacy of XJ104. These results establish that enhancing the endogenous T-cell function represents an effective strategy against invasive candidiasis. In conclusion, our study presents a novel therapeutic approach that bridges T cells andCandidapathogens, promoting robustCandida-specific immunity and controlling invasive infections caused byCandida spp. These findings underscore the potential of XJ104 as a clinically promising immunotherapy for the treatment of invasive candidiasis.",

In this study, we employed proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) to analyze the SCV proteome during infection. For this, we targeted the UltraID biotin ligase to the SCV by fusing it to a type 3 secreted effector. We demonstrate that the bacteria express and translocate the effector-UltraID fusion protein directly into host cells for labeling of the cytosolic face of the SCV surface. Proteomic analysis of biotinylated proteins revealed previously undescribed proteins associated with the SCV, including regulators of vesicular trafficking, cellular metabolism and lipid transport. Among these, VPS13C, a lipid transporter and membrane contact site protein, was identified as a critical regulator of SCV morphology and fission. Functional studies revealed that VPS13C also promotes ER-SCV contact formation, controls SCV positioning in host cells, and facilitates cell-to-cell spread by the bacteria. Together, our findings highlight the utility of BioID as a tool to study host-pathogen interactions in the context of infection and characterize VPS13C as a novel modulator of the intracellular life cycle ofS.Typhimurium.",

Specifically, D/OK replicated mostly in the upper respiratory tract and transmitted to 2/3 naive ferrets, while D/OK660HEFreplicated in both upper and lower respiratory tract (trachea) but transmitted only to 1/3 naive ferrets. Both direct inoculated and contact sentinel ferrets seroconverted at 14 days post-infection, which indicated an association with viral replication fitness and transmission efficiency. Distinct receptor fine specificities plus six amino acid mutations in the receptor binding domain of the HEF protein between swine D/OK and bovine D/660 viruses may explain the different tissue tropism and transmission efficiency observed between these two viruses. Furthermore, while no detectable virus titers were observed in the lungs and intestines of ferrets, fluorescent RNAscope probe-basedin-situhybridization assay detected viral RNAs in these tissues. Finally, deep-sequencing revealed ferret-adapted mutations in PB1, PB2, and M segments that have not appeared in natural IDV isolates from bovines or pigs which need further characterization. Taken together, results of this study demonstrate that IDV is optimized for replication and spread in mammals and subtle mutations in HEF protein may affect viral tropism and transmission efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Single-round infectious rotavirus, which lacks a gene essential for virion assembly, serves not only as a safe and effective rotavirus vaccine but also as an orally-administrable viral vector vaccine that induces mucosal immunity. Previously, we generated a single-round infectious rotavirus by partially deleting the viral VP6 gene, and demonstrated its potential as a promising vaccine platform. However, this system has several limitations; namely, low viral protein expression levels and safety concerns. Here, we addressed these challenges by introducing large deletions into the VP7 or VP4 genes, which are dispensable for viral protein expression but essential for virion assembly. These VP7- or VP4-defective viruses exhibited markedly higher protein expression in wild-type MA104 cells than the previously developed VP6-defective virus. In addition, the large deletions reduce the risk of viral reversion, thereby increasing both efficacy and safety. In a mouse model, these viruses induced neutralizing antibodies at levels comparable with those elicited by wild-type rotavirus, indicating their potential as rotavirus vaccines. Moreover, a VP4-defective rotavirus harboring a heterologous gene achieved high expression of heterologous proteins, warranting its application as a viral vector vaccine. To further increase safety, we established a reverse genetics system for the bovine rotavirus WC3 strain, a parental strain of the licensed live attenuated rotavirus vaccine, and successfully generated a single-round VP4-defective rotavirus based on the WC3 backbone. Taken together, these optimizations facilitate development of safe and effective single-round infectious rotavirus platforms suitable for human use.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, neuromuscular synapses rely on clustering of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in the muscle plasma membrane, ensuring optimal stimulation by motor neuron-released acetylcholine neurotransmitter. This clustering depends on a complex pathway based on alternative splicing ofAgrinpre-mRNAs by the RNA-binding proteins Nova1/2. Neuron-specific expression of Nova1/2 ensures the inclusion of small “Z” exons inAgrin, resulting in a neural-specific form of this extracellular proteoglycan carrying a short peptide motif that is required for binding to Lrp4 receptors on the muscle side, which in turn stimulate AChR clustering. Here we show that this intricate pathway is remarkably conserved inCiona robusta,a non-vertebrate chordate in the tunicate subphylum. We use in vivo tissue-specific CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis and heterologous “minigene” alternative splicing assays in cultured mammalian cells to show thatCionaNova is also necessary and sufficient forAgrinZ exon inclusion and downstream Lrp4-mediated AChR clustering. We present evidence that, although the overall pathway is well conserved, there are unexpected differences in Nova structure-function betweenCionaand mammals. We further show that, inCionamotor neurons, the transcription factor Ebf is a key activator ofNovaexpression, thus ultimately linking this RNA switch to a conserved, motor neuron-specific transcriptional regulatory network.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila melanogasterDown Syndrome cell adhesion molecule 1(Dscam1) gene encodes 38,016 diverse cell surface receptor proteins via alternative splicing, which have both nervous and immune functions. However, it remains elusive why organisms have evolved such an astonishing diversity of isoforms. Here, we show that fitness and immunity properties have driven the modern evolution ofDscam1isoform diversity. We assess multiple aspects of fly fitness in deletion mutants harboring exon 4, 6, or 9 clusters, respectively, reducing ectodomain isoform diversity stepwise from 18,612 to 396. All fitness-related traits generally improved as the potential number of isoforms increased; however, the magnitude of the changes varied remarkably in a variable cluster-specific manner. Correlation analysis revealed that fitness-related traits were much more sensitive to reductions in Dscam1 diversity compared to canonical neuronal self/non-self discrimination. We conclude that the role of Dscam1 isoforms in canonical neuronal self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination is mediated by a small fraction of all isoforms (<1/10), whereas a separate role essential for other developmental contexts and resistances, likely in fitness and immunity, requires almost full isoform diversity. Thus, fitness and immunity properties, rather than canonical neuronal functions, are the dominant drivers during the modern diversification of the Dscam1 isoform. Our findings suggest that Dscam1 diversity is closely linked to adaptation and species diversification in arthropods.",

However, how chromatin dysregulation in glial cells impacts cognitive abilities is less well understood. Here, we demonstrate that targeted loss of the ATRX chromatin remodeler targeted to microglia leads to altered cell morphology, increased chromatin accessibility profiles, and de-repression of endogenous retroelements, triggering viral mimicry. In mice that lack ATRX in microglia, CA1 hippocampal neuron morphology and electrophysiological properties are affected, and the mice display specific behavioral deficits. These findings demonstrate that ATRX is required in microglia to preserve chromatin structure and maintain microglial homeostasis.

SevO is an understudied global health disease, limiting knowledge about its mechanisms and impacts. In genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses of the tail end of the BMI distribution (≥95thpercentile BMI) and two SevO phenotypes [Obesity Class III BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2and Obesity Class IV BMI ≥ 50 kg/m2] in 159,359 individuals across eleven ancestrally diverse population-based studies followed by replication in 480,897 individuals across six ancestrally diverse studies, we identified and replicated three novel signals in known loci of BMI [TENM2,PLCL2,ZNF184], associated with SevO traits. We confirmed a large overlap in the genetic architecture of continuous BMI and severe obesity phenotypes, suggesting little genetic heterogeneity in common variants, between obesity subgroups. Systematic analyses combining functional mapping, polygenic risk scores (PRS), phenome wide association studies (PheWAS) and environmental risk factors further reinforce shared downstream comorbidities associated with continuous measures of BMI and the importance of known lifestyle factors in interaction with genetic predisposition to SevO. Our study expands the number of SevO signals, demonstrates a strong overlap in the genetic architecture of SevO and BMI and reveals a remarkable impact of SevO on the clinical phenome, affording new opportunities for clinical prevention and mechanistic insights.",

These antibodies wane over time, reducing their capacity to inhibit vaccine-induced immune responses, including immunoglobulin A (IgA). We aimed to estimate the optimal window for administering an additional rotavirus vaccine dose, beyond the routine doses given at 6 and 10 weeks of age, to maximise immunogenicity in an LMIC, high-disease-burdened setting.",

Recent investigations have underscored the potential role of cilia within the respiratory tracts of infected hosts, particularly regarding the entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, the mechanisms by which other CoVs exert their virulence through ciliary interactions remain inadequately elucidated. In this context, our research has demonstrated that porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) induce ciliary disassembly within six hours post-infection during the early infection stage. Utilizing mass spectrometry, we identified histone deacetylases 6 (HDAC6) or Aurora A (AurA) as binding partners of PEDV or PDCoV membrane (M) proteins. Immunofluorescence studies corroborated that the AurA-HDAC6 axis serves as a principal regulator of ciliary disassembly. Additionally, M proteins from all four CoV genera—PEDV, SARS-CoV-2, PDCoV, and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)—were observed to congregate at the ciliary base. Molecular techniques, including immunoprecipitation and molecular docking combined with molecular mechanics/generalized born surface area (MM/GBSA) free energy decomposition analysis, further revealed that CoV M proteins interact with both AurA and HDAC6. These interactions depend on conserved residues at the transmembrane-cytosolic junction of M proteins, essential for their binding to the AurA-HDAC6 axis. Mutations disrupting these residues significantly impaired the binding affinity, thus inhibiting the associated ciliary disassembly process. Collectively, our findings illuminate a conserved regulatory mechanism involving CoV M proteins across all four genera, contributing to ciliary disassembly during early infection. This work enhances our understanding of the fundamental interactions between CoVs and host cells, positioning AurA and HDAC6 as potential therapeutic targets for a broad spectrum of CoV infections.",

This study identified Toll-interacting protein (TOLLIP) as a pivotal negative regulator of IFN production in grass carp(Ctenopharyngodon idella). Upon grass carp reovirus (GCRV) infection, TOLLIP expression increases significantly in tissues and cells. Furthermore, TOLLIP overexpression reduced GCRV- and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C)-induced IFN expression, whereastollipknockdown increased the cellular IFN production capacity. TOLLIP subsequently binds and degrades STING. Further mechanistic studies revealed that TOLLIP degrades STING in a dose-dependent manner via an autophagy-lysosome-dependent pathway. Interestingly, autophagy-related protein 5 (ATG5) was found to interact with TOLLIP and reduce TOLLIP-mediated STING degradation afteratg5knockdown. In addition, TOLLIP attenuated STING-driven IFN activation and compromised antiviral efficacy. These findings demonstrate that fish TOLLIP plays a specialized regulatory role in antiviral innate immunity, balancing immune defence with homeostasis maintenance.",

However, regulatory mechanisms controlling sphingolipid and ganglioside biosynthesis in mammalian cells are less known. Here, we show that RICTOR, the regulatory subunit of mTORC2, regulates the synthesis of sphingolipids and gangliosides in human luminal breast cancer-specific MCF-7 and BT-474 cells through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms. We observe that RICTOR regulates glucosylceramide levels by modulating the expression of UDP-Glucose Ceramide Glucosyl transferase (UGCG). We identify Zinc Finger protein X-linked (ZFX) as a RICTOR-responsive transcription factor whose recruitment to theUGCGpromoter is regulated by DNA methyltransferase 1 and histone demethylase (KDM5A), which are known AKT substrates. We further demonstrate that RICTOR regulates the synthesis of GD3 gangliosides through ZFX and UGCG, and triggers the activation of the EGFR signaling pathway, thereby promoting tumor growth. In line with our findings in human cell culture and mouse models, we observe an elevated expression of RICTOR, ZFX, and UGCG in Indian luminal breast cancer tissues and in TCGA and METABRIC datasets. Together, we establish a key regulatory circuit, RICTOR-AKT-ZFX-UGCG-Ganglioside-EGFR-AKT, and elucidate its contribution to breast cancer progression.",

To understand and control synchronization dynamics in the real world, it is essential to identify the network from the observed data. While previous studies have developed the methods for inferring the network of asynchronous systems, it remains challenging to infer the network of well-synchronized oscillators. In this study, we develop a method for inferring the network of synchronized and desynchronized oscillators from time series. Our method expands the applicability of network inference to a wider class of oscillatory systems. The proposed method discards a large part of data used for inference, which may seem counterintuitive. However, the effectiveness of the method is supported by the phase reduction theory, a well-established theory for weakly coupled oscillators. We verify the proposed method by applying it to simulated data of the limit-cycle oscillators.

An emblematic feature of RH is the high vascularity, which is explained by the overexpression of angiogenic factors (AFs) arising from the pVHL impairment. The introduction of Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) allowed observing this feature with exceptional detail. Here, we combine OCTA images and a mechanistic model to investigate tumor growth and vascular development in a patient-specific way. We derived our model from the agreed pathology for RH and focused on the earliest stages of tumor-induced angiogenesis. Our simulations closely resemble the medical images, supporting the capability of our model to simulate vascular patterning in actual patients. Our results also suggest that angiogenesis in RH occurs upon reaching a critical dimension (around 200 μm), followed by the rapid formation of stable vascular networks. These findings open a new perspective on the crucial role of time in antiangiogenic therapy in RH, which has resulted in ineffective control. Indeed, it might be that when RH is diagnosed, angiogenesis is already too advanced to be effectively targeted with any effective means. Moreover, our simulations suggest that vascularization in RH is not a continuous process but an inconstant development with long, stable phases and rapid episodes of vascular sprouting.",

    "abstract": "Reproductive isolation and genomic divergence both accumulate over time in the formation and persistence of distinct biological species. The pace of “speciation clocks” quantified with pre-zygotic and post-zygotic reproductive isolation, however, differs among taxa, with pre-zygotic isolation tending to evolve sooner in some but not all taxa. To address this issue in nematodes for the first time, here we infer the species tree and divergence times across the phylogeny of 51 species ofCaenorhabditis. We incorporate several molecular evolutionary strategies in phylogenomic dating to account for complications in this group due to lack of fossil calibration, deep molecular divergence with synonymous-site saturation, and codon usage bias. By integrating divergence times with experimental data on pre- and post-zygotic reproductive isolation, we infer that post-zygotic isolation accumulates faster than pre-zygotic isolation inCaenorhabditisand that hybrid sterility evolves sooner than hybrid inviability. These findings are consistent with speciation being driven principally by intrinsic isolating barriers and the disproportionate fragility of germline developmental programs to disruption. We estimate that it takes approximately 50 million generations for intrinsic post-zygotic reproductive compatibility to be reduced by half, on average, between diverging pairs ofCaenorhabditis. The protracted reproductive isolation clocks inCaenorhabditismay, in part, reflect the capacity to retain population genetic hyperdiversity, the incomplete sampling of global biodiversity, and as-yet uncharacterized incipient or cryptic species.",

In plants, the biological functions of various PP-InsP species are poorly understood, largely due to the absence of canonical enzymes found in other eukaryotes. The recent identification of a new PP-InsP isomer with yet unknown enantiomeric identity, 4/6-InsP7in the eudicotArabidopsis thaliana, further highlights the intricate PP-InsP signalling network employed by plants. Yet, the abundance of 4/6-InsP7in land plants, the enzyme(s) responsible for its synthesis, and the physiological functions of this species are all currently unknown. In this study, we show that 4/6-InsP7is ubiquitous in the studied land plants. Our findings demonstrate that theArabidopsisinositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) homologs, AtIPK2α and AtIPK2β phosphorylates InsP6to generate 4/6-InsP7as the predominant PP-InsP speciesin vitro. Consistent with this, AtIPK2α and AtIPK2β act redundantly to control 4/6-InsP7productionin planta. Notably, activity of these IPK2 proteins is critical for heat stress acclimation inArabidopsis. Our parallel investigations using the liverwortMarchantia polymorphasuggest that the PP-InsP synthase activity of IPK2 and role of IPK2 in regulating the heat stress response are conserved in land plants. Furthermore, we show that the transcription activity of heat shock factor (HSF) is regulated by IPK2 proteins, providing a mechanistic framework of IPK2-controlled heat stress tolerance in land plants. Collectively, our study indicates that IPK2-type kinases have played a critical role in transducing environmental cues for biological processes during land plant evolution.",

The int2MR can assess a broad range of risk exposure effects on diseases and traits, revealing interactions unattainable with incomplete or limited individual-level data. Simulation studies demonstrate that int2MR effectively controls type I error rates under various settings while achieving considerable power gains with the integration of additional group-combined GWAS data. We applied int2MR to two data analyses. First, we identified risk exposures with sex-interaction effects on ADHD, and our results suggested potentially elevated inflammation in males. Second, we detected age-group-specific risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease pathologies in the oldest-old (age 95+); many of these factors were related to immune and inflammatory processes. Our findings suggest that reduced chronic inflammation may underlie the distinct pathological mechanisms observed in this age group. The int2MR is a robust and flexible tool for assessing group-specific or interaction effects, providing insights into disease mechanisms.",

    "title": "Meiotic Sex Chromosome Inactivation: Conservation across theDrosophilagenus",
    "abstract": "The inherent differences between sex chromosomes in males and females create conflicts in gene expression, driving the evolution of regulatory mechanisms such as Meiotic Sex Chromosome Inactivation (MSCI), a process that transcriptionally silences the sex chromosomes during male meiosis. In this study, we explore the evolutionary dynamics of MSCI within theDrosophilagenus by analyzing transcriptomes across different stages of spermatogenesis inD. melanogasterand its progressively more distant relatives,D. simulans,D. willistoni, andD. mojavensis. Stage-enriched bulk RNA sequencing, showing a strong correlation in spermatogenic gene expression patterns among these species, revealed that MSCI dates back to the early evolution of theDrosophilagenus, impacting the regulation of both coding and long non-coding RNAs. Notably, for newly evolved genes, X-linked genes show higher expression levels than autosomal genes during mitosis and meiosis, indicating that MSCI predominantly regulates older genes. In contrast, newly evolved autosomal genes exhibit a gradual increase in expression throughout spermatogenesis, reaching their peak in the post-meiotic phase. During this phase, the expression of X-linked new genes decreases, eventually aligning with that of autosomal genes. This expression pattern suggests that haploid selection plays a crucial role in the regulation of new genes, with monoallelic expression of the X chromosome providing an advantage across all stages of germline development, while autosomal gene expression gains a selective edge primarily in the post-meiotic phase. Together, these findings provide new insights into the evolution of sex chromosomes and highlight the critical role of MSCI in shaping gene expression profiles inDrosophila.",

    "title": "Evaluating spatial access to primary care and health disparities in a rural district of Sri Lanka: Implications for strategic health policy interventions",
    "abstract": "Primary care accessibility is optimised by equity in service coverage, especially in resource-limited settings. This study examined spatial accessibility to private and public primary care facilities (PCFs) in the Anuradhapura District, Sri Lanka, which offer both allopathic and alternative medicine, while analysing the correlation to social development indices. A two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) was applied to evaluate spatial accessibility across 657 Grama Niladhari Divisions (GNDs). Data on population, primary care doctors (PCDs), social development indices, and spatial administrative maps were collected from corresponding departments. The Spatial Accessibility Index (SAI) was analysed among 404 PCFs in the ArcGIS application and expressed as the number of PCDs per 10,000 population within a designated buffer (5km/ 10km). SAIs were correlated with the district’s key social development indices. The study found that the private allopathic sector covered 63.7% of PCFs and 49% of PCDs. The national primary care coverage (NPCC) target of one PCD:5000 population was met at 86% by including all allopathic PCDs, but reduced to 25% with only the public sector. The average SAI for a GND was 4.50 and 4.67 for both buffers, indicating sufficient primary care accessibility compared to NPCC targets. SAIs were positively correlated with population density (r[21]=.735, p < 0.01), availability of education facilities (r[21]=.600, p < 0.01), inward healthcare capacity (r[21]=.810, p < 0.001), and availability financial infrastructure (r[21]=.572, p = 0.05). A negative correlation was reported for poverty measures (r[21]=-.603, p = 0.03). The study identified adequate access to primary care in the district, highlighting the private sector’s vital role in service delivery. However, only one-quarter of the NPCC target is provided by public-sector allopathic PCDs. Areas with high population density and educational resources show better access, while poverty is linked to reduced access. A comprehensive approach that addresses both spatial and aspatial factors is necessary to enhance rural healthcare access.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 has affected millions worldwide. Research characterized immune responses of individuals who acquired SARS-CoV-2 and identified co-factors, such as HIV, associated with greater likelihood of poor clinical outcomes. SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) are a strong correlate of protection but their elicitation in people living with HIV (PLWH), and particularly in southern Africa, is less well characterized. HVTN 405/HPTN 1901 was an observational cohort study of individuals recently recovered from SARS-CoV-2. We describe 323 participants enrolled early in the pandemic (June 2020 to January 2021) in Zambia (n = 12), Malawi (n = 13), Zimbabwe (n = 59), and South Africa (n = 239), profiling their SARS-CoV-2-specific nAb responses and associations with demographics, comorbidities, disease severity, and time since diagnosis based on linear and logistic regression. Participants’ median age was 39 years, 63.5% were assigned female sex at birth, 71.2% were black African, and 39 (12.1%) were PLWH. Approximately one in four participants (25.7%) had asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2, 47.4% were symptomatic but not hospitalized, and 26.9% were hospitalized with COVID-19. Participants in these groups were enrolled at a median of 51.5 days, 53 days, and 60 days post-SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 nAbs were measured in serum using one of two calibrated assays. Most (291/322, 90.4%) participants had positive nAb responses at enrollment. Across all participants, nAb responses generally declined in magnitude between enrollment and 2–3 months thereafter, then increased through month 12 coincident with epidemiologically observed new waves of acquisition. In a multivariate model adjusted for potentially confounding factors, PLWH had a 65% lower geometric mean (GM) nAb ID50 titer compared to people without HIV (PWOH) (GMR: 0.35, p = 0.003, q = 0.006). Greater disease severity, older age (>55 years), high BMI (≥30) and diabetes were associated with higher nAb ID50 titers (all p < 0.05, all q < 0.20).These findings are important, as nAb titers are predictive of vulnerability to COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The COVID- 19 pandemic and subsequent disruptions to in-person learning presented unanticipated challenges to elementary school systems across North America. Elementary students are particularly vulnerable to the negative outcomes of extended online learning, as this developmental stage is crucial for the social, emotional, and cognitive growth of students. To date, no research has synthesized what we currently know about the impacts of the pandemic on these developmental outcomes among students. As such, this scoping review explores and synthesizes what is currently known regarding elementary students’ social, emotional, and cognitive development during the COVID- 19 pandemic in North America. In accordance with the Joanna Briggs Guide, three databases were searched in September 2024, and results were uploaded into Covidence wherein they were screened for eligibility. A total of 13 peer-reviewed articles met the inclusion criteria for this review (i.e., included elementary students, spoke to social/emotional/cognitive development, peer-reviewed articles written in English and conducted in North America). Thematic analyses revealed four themes including (1) lack of socialization opportunities; (2) emotional regression; (3) cognitive gaps in learning; and (4) inequitable impacts on development. School-based supports are needed for all students, but particularly those facing multiple, intersecting health and social disparities, to bolster positive development post-pandemic and to mitigate long-term negative health outcomes.",

Despite the critical role of primary healthcare centers in outbreak response, their level of preparedness (long-term planning, including protocols, training, and resource allocation) and readiness (immediate operational capacity for response) in Addis Ababa is not well understood. An Institutional-based, cross-sectional mixed-methods study was conducted from August to September 2024 across all 101 public health centers in Addis Ababa. Quantitative data were collected using a standardized 14-point WHO checklist (adapted from the Ethiopian national cholera preparedness guideline), which assessed preparedness and readiness and analyzed using binary logistic regression in SPSS version 25. Qualitative data from five key informant interviews and two focus group discussions with health administrators and providers were analyzed thematically to explore barriers.. A total of 101 health centers data found in Addis Ababa were analyzed. Preparedness was measured as meeting ≥75% of indicators (11/14), combining both structural preparedness and operational readiness components. From the total 101 health centers 56 (55.4%) with 95% CI (45.2-65.3) of them were prepared for cholera outbreak response. Having emergency preparedness response plan had significant association with cholera outbreak response preparedness in multivariable analysis at 95% CI (p < 0.05). (AOR = 6.88, 95% CI= (1.39-9.89)). The main themes that emerged were financial barriers, lack of cooperation and multi sectorial involvement, and lack of motivation from the health care workers. Cholera outbreak preparedness in health centers of Addis Ababa was found to be 56.7%. Having emergency preparedness response plan in health centers had significant association with cholera outbreak response preparedness. Lack of multi sectorial involvement, financial barrier and lack of motivation from healthcare providers were the main identified barriers towards cholera outbreak response preparedness. The government should develop and implement a comprehensive emergency preparedness response plan specifically addressing cholera outbreaks.",

Although some exercises have been constructed, international and local consensus on exercise programs for weight loss among postmenopausal women with excess weight (overweight and obesity) gain is lacking. We aimed to validate a culturally adapted exercise-based weight loss program for postmenopausal women using the Delphi consensus methodology. The study process consisted of three Delphi rounds among twelve international and twenty-one local experts. Participants were recruited via purposive sampling representing physiotherapists, exercise physiologists, exercise scientists, human kinetics and health education based on their interests and knowledge. A preliminary program was developed based on literature reviews and project findings. In the first Delphi round, open-ended responses were analysed thematically and converted into statements. Experts rated their agreement with these statements on a 5-point Likert scale in the second round. Consensus was defined as at least 60% strong agreement/disagreement. In the final round, participants reviewed the program and achieved an 80% consensus threshold. Thirty-three experts completed all three rounds, reaching consensus across four domains: health assessment, pre-exercise parameters, exercise dosage, and physician referrals. Response rates were high, with a final participation rate of 78% (n = 32).The high response rate established a strong consensus, providing clinicians with evidence-based recommendations to improve health outcomes for postmenopausal women in Ghana, with particular emphasis on the cultural adaptation process, especially the innovative inclusion of Ampe in the intervention.",

    "title": "A broader lens on tuberculosis cost-effectiveness analysis: How patient-incurred costs and post-tuberculosis outcomes reshape estimates in a multi-country study",
    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health challenge, with financial and health impacts extending beyond treatment. Both the perspective adopted in cost-effectiveness analyses—which critically determines choices such as the inclusion of patient-incurred costs—and the extent to which long-term post-treatment considerations are incorporated have important policy implications. This study examines how the choice of timeframe and cost perspectives influence the estimated cost-effectiveness of TB interventions, particularly preventative measures. Using data from 19 WHO TB patient cost surveys and global epidemiological databases, we modelled a hypothetical preventative TB intervention, generating four incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per country under different analytical approaches. These included a conventional timeframe up to treatment completion, an extended timeframe incorporating post-TB effects, and two perspectives that either included or excluded patient-incurred costs. The approach yielding the lowest ICER (societal perspective; extended timeframe) was anchored in the primary analysis to a 1×GDP per capita threshold. Using this benchmark simplified cross-country comparisons and removed the need for health system cost estimates. Sensitivity and scenario analyses explored how threshold values influenced the relative impact of timeframe and costing perspective. ICERs were higher when patient costs were omitted or the post-TB period was excluded, peaking when both were absent. However, across all countries, post-TB considerations had a far greater impact on cost-effectiveness. On average, removing the post-TB period increased ICERs by over 50% (ranging from +19.3% in Ghana to +108% in Mongolia, societal perspective). Including patient-incurred costs increased the likelihood that prevention was cost-effective, particularly in low-GDP settings with lower willingness-to-pay thresholds. However, their impact was minimal above 2×GDP. Our study highlights how narrowly defining the financial and health burden of tuberculosis in cost-effectiveness analyses risks underestimating the benefits of interventions—particularly in lower-GDP countries where the socioeconomic burden of tuberculosis is greatest—which could lead to misguided policy decisions that overlook the full impact of tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragile health system in Ghana and in particular, its specimen referral system (SRS), which for years had been limited to Tuberculosis (TB), HIV Viral Load and Early Infant Diagnosis among few laboratories. The implementation of a siloed SRS with the sole focus on TB, HIV viral load, and early infant diagnosis has been to the detriment of other diseases of public health importance. This programmatic activity aimed to assess the feasibility of an integrated specimen referral system (ISRS) in Ghana’s Greater Accra and Northern Regions. Between January and November 2022, we established and piloted an ISRS through extensive stakeholder engagements using the hub and spoke model. As part of the intervention package, capacity building workshops, logistics support and transportation were provided to all program facilities. Standard paper-based log books and interviews were employed to collect data from 105 health facilities (84 in Greater Accra and 21 in Northern Region) to evaluate the ISRS’s successes, challenges, and develop future scale-up recommendations. Overall, 4,239 samples ranging from suspected cases of measles, monkeypox, COVID-19, yellow fever (YF), acute flaccid paralysis, TB, Buruli ulcer, HIV viral load (VL), early infant diagnosis (EID), and meningitis were transported during the program period. The turnaround time (TAT) varied across diseases: 1–2 days for TB/COVID-19, 5–7 days for YF, 7–14 days for influenza, and 14 days – 3 months for VL/EID cases. The quality of specimens referred improved, with only 2 samples rejected during the pilot. Qualitative analysis uncovered improvements in ISRS efficiency including, sample delivery, TAT, documentation, coordination and logistics, monitoring and tracking, sample quality, and record-keeping. This preliminary programmatic activity provides evidence of the feasibility of creating a nationwide ISRS to facilitate the quick detection and management of all diseases of public health importance in Ghana.",

    "abstract": "Chronic ischemic heart disease (CIHD) is one of the leading causes of significant morbidity and mortality in the United States. While previous studies have reported an overall decline in ischemic heart disease mortality, contemporary trends in CIHD-related mortality across sex, race, and urbanization status remain inadequately explored. We examined CIHD-related mortality trends in the U.S. from 1999 to 2019.We analyzed mortality data from the CDC WONDER database using CIHD ICD-10 codes. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) were calculated per 100,000 individuals. Trends were analyzed using Joinpoint regression to determine annual percentage change (APC) and average annual percentage change (AAPC) with 95% confidence intervals. Over two decades, 5,729,619 CIHD-related deaths were recorded. AAMR declined from 185.6 (95% CI: 184.9–186.2) per 100,000 in 1999 to 94.9 (95% CI: 94.5–95.3) per 100,000 in 2019. There were, however, disparities among demographic groups. Males had consistently higher mortality than females (overall AAMR: 167.2 vs. 96.0 per 100,000), and among racial groups, non-Hispanic Black individuals had the highest AAMR (148.3 per 100,000. Initially, urban areas had higher mortality than rural areas, but by 2019, their AAMRs converged (urban: 94.7 [95% CI: 94.3–95.1]; rural: 96.1 [95% CI: 95.1–97.0] per 100,000). CIHD mortality has declined across all demographics over the last two decades; however, disparities persist, particularly among males and non-Hispanic Black individuals. While rural and urban populations had differing mortality rates initially, they showed similar AAMR by the end of the study period. Focused public health interventions are crucial to addressing these inequities.",

This study retrospectively assesses the prevalence and risk factors of severe food insecurity and poor food consumption in Productive Safety Net Programme households in drought-prone Ethiopia. Data was from the USAID-funded Resilience Food Security Activity baseline survey in East Hararghe, Ethiopia. Severe food insecurity (n = 4628; multivariate n = 4335) was defined as Food Insecurity Experience Scale (≥7) and poor food consumption (n = 4554; multivariate n = 4268) was defined as Food Consumption Score (≤21). Logistic regression identified adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval of risk and protective factors. Severe food insecurity prevalence was 77.79% and poor food consumption was 69.74%. Risk factors for severe food insecurity included women/girls aged 15–19 (1.79; 1.36-2.34), current pregnancy (1.51; 1.17-1.96), history of pregnancy (3.46; 2.76-4.33), cash-earning work (1.35; 1.12-1.61), daily-per-capita food consumption <1.61USD (2.98; 1.91-4.66), crop-planting (1.67; 1.31-2.13), and handwashing facilities (3.83; 1.92-7.63); protective factors included two or more children-under-5 (0.72; 0.60-0.88), raising livestock/crops to sell (0.50; 0.42-0.60), and raising oxen (0.34; 0.26-0.45). Risk factors for poor food consumption included woman/girl (1.44; 1.15-1.81) and household-head no education (1.46; 1.18-1.79), daily-per-capita food consumption <1.61USD (4.01; 2.58-6.21), and financial services (2.10; 1.69-2.59); protective factors included women/girls aged 15–19 (0.59; 0.46-0.76) and 30–49 (0.76; 0.63-0.91), two or more children-under-5 (0.77; 0.64-0.91), current pregnancy (0.57; 0.47-0.70), history of pregnancy (0.70; 0.55-0.89), crop-planting (0.57; 0.44-0.75), raising livestock/crops to sell (0.40; 0.34-0.48) and raising oxen (0.68; 0.52-0.90). Vulnerable households included those with pregnant/lactating women, mothers, adolescent girls/women, no education, low assets, and no livestock. Our findings highlight a conceptual distinction, women/girls pregnancy and/or age status may influence household perception and/or definitions of food security despite reporting adequate consumption. The dual burden of food insecurity and poor consumption threatens current and future generations, and data-driven action can help progress towards the goal of zero hunger in Ethiopia.",

    "abstract": "The universal health coverage (UHC) efforts in low- and middle-income countries such as Ethiopia encounter significant challenges in the implementation of community-based health insurance (CBHI) programs. This study investigated barriers and enablers influencing CBHI enrollment in Sidama National Regional State. Using purposive sampling, 48 participants were recruited, including four focus groups (12 participants each) and 20 key informant interviews. Participants comprised CBHI members (n = 5), non-members (n = 5), community leaders (n = 4), policymakers (n = 3), and healthcare providers (n = 3). Data collection occurred over three weeks in May 2024, with thematic analysis employed following phenomenological principles. Ethical considerations such as informed consent, confidentiality, and data protection were strictly observed. Findings indicate that awareness of CBHI has improved across Sidama; however, persistent misconceptions remain, including beliefs that CBHI is exclusively for the poor or is synonymous with preparing for illness. Several structural barriers were identified, notably ambiguous governance frameworks, a lack of accountability, and inadequate human resources. Issues in service delivery further undermine program effectiveness, characterized by discrimination against CBHI members, frequent shortages of essential medications and laboratory services, and delays in payment processes. Financial management challenges, lack of transparency, and the absence of grievance mechanisms were also found to erode community trust in the CBHI system. Despite these challenges, CBHI is recognized as valuable for reducing healthcare costs and enhancing access, particularly among women and low-income households, empowering women’s autonomy in health decisions. Community-based health insurance (CBHI) in the Sidama Region has improved awareness and access to healthcare. However, sustainability is challenged by misconceptions, governance challenges, and service delivery issues, which undermine trust and reduce enrollment and retention. Addressing governance, transparency, equity, and community involvement is crucial to strengthening CBHI and ensuring equitable healthcare access.",

A total of 23 focus group discussions with pregnant and late postpartum (≥6 months) participants and 48 in-depth interviews with early postpartum (≤6 weeks) participants were conducted using semi-structured guides. Data were analyzed using a collaborative, inductive, thematic approach. Four overarching themes were identified and were cross-cutting irrespective of continent or country : (1) physical and emotional challenges pose a barrier to daily activities; (2) lack of social support detracts from women’s QoL; (3) receipt of social support mitigates adverse impacts of maternal morbidities on QoL; and (4) economic challenges exacerbate declines in women’s QoL during pregnancy and postpartum. Physical and emotional morbidities related to childbearing severely limited women’s ability to complete daily tasks and adversely impacted their perceived QoL. Social and financial support from the baby’s father, family and/or in-laws, community members, and healthcare providers are important to mitigate the impacts of pregnancy and postpartum challenges on women’s health and well-being.",

    "abstract": "Glycosomes, peroxisome-like organelles inTrypanosoma cruzi, contain enzymes involved in various metabolic processes, including glycolysis. Glycosomal ABC transporters (GATs) play a vital role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis by facilitating metabolite exchange between glycosomes and the cytoplasm. GAT3 is a member of the GAT family, which also includesGAT1andGAT2.GAT3transcript levels are downregulated in benznidazole-resistantT. cruzipopulations; however, its specific functions remain unknown. Therefore, in this study, we generatedGAT3single-knockout and null mutant lines of theT. cruziDm28c strain using the CRISPR/Cas9 system to investigate GAT3 roles in parasite biology. RT-qPCR revealed increasedGAT2transcript levels in theGAT3null mutant line, without any changes inGAT1levels. Our findings suggest thatGAT3is not essential forT. cruzisurvival, as null mutant parasites showed no growth difference compared to the Cas9-expressing controls. Moreover, theGAT3single-knockout line exhibited increased resistance to benznidazole, whereas the null mutant line exhibited benznidazole susceptibility similar to the control. Furthermore, bothGAT3single-knockout and null mutant lines showed increased tolerance to hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative stress.In vitroinfection assay of L929 murine fibroblasts revealed that theGAT3null parasites exhibited a significantly lower infection rate and fewer intracellular amastigotes than the controls. Overall,GAT3is crucial forT. cruziinfectivity and the regulation of oxidative stress responses, playing key roles in the metabolic regulation and pathogenicity of this parasite.",

    "title": "Early events in dengue virus infection inducing cytokine storm: The dynamic interplay of pattern-recognition receptors, inflammasome activation, and biphasic NF-κB and STAT1-dependent inflammatory responses in human mononuclear phagocytes",
    "abstract": "A Cytokine storm is critical in severe dengue, significantly contributing to disrupted endothelial integrity, plasma leakage, and haemorrhage manifestations in affected patients. Various reports have demonstrated that mononuclear phagocytes, including monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages, are target cells of DENV infection. They contribute to viral spread into tissues and promote robust inflammatory responses and immunopathology. However, it remains unclear whether the early events of DENV infection play a role in triggering cytokine storms in infected mononuclear phagocytes. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptomic profile ofin vitroDENV-2-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) based on the kinetics of viral replication through a standard growth curve. To verify the accuracy of our approach, we used RT-qPCR, ELISA, and transcriptomic data fromin vitroDENV-2-infected monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) and monocytes obtained from acute dengue patients. RNA-Seq analysis revealed dynamic changes in the transcriptional profile of DENV-2-infected MDMs throughout the viral growth curve. Two waves of differentially expressed genes were observed: the first occurred during the eclipse period of viral replication (3 to 5.5 h.p.i) and was associated with the induction of NF-kB-dependent pro-inflammatory factors, while the second wave at 24 h.p.i coincided with peaks of DENV-2 replication and induction of both NF-kB- and STAT1-dependent pro-inflammatory responses. Additionally, DENV-2 infection promoted the dynamic activation of Toll-like receptors, RIG-like receptors, inflammasomes, and inflammatory pathways, triggering innate pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses. A robust multi-type IFN-dependent antiviral response was also observed at the late stage of infection. A similar transcriptomic profile was found in DENV-2-infected MDDCs and monocyte subsets from acute dengue patients, further confirming the reliability of ourin vitromodel of DENV-infected MDMs. Together, results suggest that recognizing viral PAMPs during the eclipse period of DENV-2 infection promotes a robust NF-kB-dependent pro-inflammatory response in MDMs. In addition, at later stages of infection, recognizing structural DENV-PAMPs and/or viral replication intermediates induces both NF-kB- and STAT1-dependent pro-inflammatory responses, leading to a cytokine storm. These findings highlight the critical role of monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells in detecting DENV infection and triggering a cytokine stormin vitroandin vivo. This suggests that these cell populations could be potential targets for future immunotherapies to modulate the inflammatory response to DENV infection.",

    "abstract": "The interactions between bacterial pathogens, helminths, and commensal microbiota in the gut form a complex ecological network that profoundly impacts host immunity and health. Pathogens employ strategies such as type VI secretion systems (T6SS) and inflammation induction to evade colonization resistance, disrupt microbial balance, and establish self-benefit ecological niches. These interactions involve competition with commensal bacteria and helminths, which play a critical role in maintaining gut homeostasis by occupying ecological niches, competing for nutrient, and supporting the mucus barrier. Meanwhile, helminths can modulate commensal bacterial gene expression, metabolic activity, and survival by secreting excretory–secretory products. In addition, by inducing a Th2 immune response, helminths can enhance the intestinal mucosal barrier, alter the gut microbiota composition, and thereby inhibit bacterial pathogen colonization. Interestingly, helminths and pathogens can exhibit synergistic or competitive relationships. For instance,Ascaris lumbricoidesmay provide a survival niche forVibrio cholerae, while helminths can also indirectly inhibit pathogenic bacteria through immune modulation. These intricate interactions influence gut microbial composition, digestion, and immune function, and are closely associated with diseases. Future research should focus on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions. Understanding the interactions between pathogens, helminths, and commensal microbiota not only provides novel insights into maintaining host immune homeostasis but also establishes a theoretical foundation for future development of gut health intervention strategies.",

    "title": "Rapid clearance of inducible HIV-1 proviruses after initiation of antiretroviral therapy",
    "abstract": "Despite its efficacy, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not curative, and HIV-1 rebound occurs whenever treatment is interrupted. The viral reservoir in latently infected cells is the source of the infection resurgence, making it crucial to understand when and how this reservoir is established so that it can be targeted more effectively. In this study, we evaluated the decay dynamics of proviral DNA in 40 ART-naive people initiating dolutegravir-based treatment and compared these dynamics to the decay kinetics of inducible proviruses, as measured using the VIP-SPOT assay. Intensive sampling during the first month, followed by regular sampling up to 48 weeks, enabled us to outline the biphasic decay dynamics of different fractions of the viral reservoir. Our results show that the first decay phase of inducible proviruses is significantly faster than that of total HIV-1 DNA (2.6 daysversus5.1 weeks), indicating that selective pressure on this specific fraction of proviruses is particularly effective during the first days after ART initiation. These findings suggest that therapeutic interventions aimed at impacting the viral reservoir by boosting the immune response targeting the inducible fraction should be implemented at the time of, or immediately before, treatment initiation.",

    "abstract": "Non-coding RNAs play a significant role in viral infection cycles, with recent attention focused on circular RNAs (circRNAs) originating from various viral families. Notably, these circRNAs have been associated with oncogenesis and alterations in viral fitness. However, identifying their expression has proven more challenging than initially anticipated due to unique viral characteristics. This challenge has the potential to impede progress in our understanding of viral circRNAs. Key hurdles in working with viral genomes include: (1) the presence of repetitive regions that can lead to misalignment of sequencing reads, and (2) unconventional splicing mechanisms that deviate from conserved eukaryotic patterns. To address these challenges, we developed vCircTrappist, a bioinformatic pipeline tailored to identify backsplicing events and pinpoint loci expressing circRNAs in RNA sequencing data. Applying this pipeline, we obtained novel insights from both new and existing datasets encompassing a range of animal and human pathogens belonging to Herpesviridae, Retroviridae, Adenoviridae, Flaviviridae and Orthomyxoviridae families. Subsequent RT-PCR and Sanger sequencings validated the accuracy of the developed bioinformatic tool for a selection of new candidate virus-derived circRNAs. These findings demonstrate that vCircTrappist is an open and unbiased approach for comprehensive identification of virus-derived circRNAs.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 andMycobacterium tuberculosis(Mtb) coinfections are a major public health problem but are not well characterized. HIV-1 Tat is secreted by infected cells, generating nanomolar concentrations of Tat in the sera of people living with HIV. Circulating Tat enters cells, binds to PI(4,5)P2then undergoes palmitoylation, thereby becoming resident on this phosphoinositide. Here, we found that Tat favors the multiplication of Mtb in macrophages. Moreover, Tat renders zebrafish larvae more sensitive to mycobacterial infection. We found that Tat binding to PI(4,5)P2and palmitoylation enable Tat to inhibit the recruitment of the AP-2 adaptor, thereby inhibiting clathrin-mediated endocytosis and in turn autophagy. This inhibition prevents the degradation of intracellular pathogens such as Mtb and opsonizedToxoplasma gondii,but also of lipid droplets, thereby facilitating the access of these pathogens to lipids. We thus identified a mechanism enabling HIV Tat to favor the multiplication of intracellular pathogens such as Mtb.",

    "abstract": "Human lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis are Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), of major public health concern. Prophylaxis and treatment rely on anthelmintics that effectively eliminate migrating microfilariae but lack efficacy against adult filarial worms. To expedite the elimination of both diseases, drugs with adulticidal activity are needed. The broad-spectrum anthelmintic emodepside, a nematode selective SLO-1 K channel activator, is a promising candidate for the treatment of onchocerciasis due to its macrofilaricidal activity againstOnchocerca volvulus. Nevertheless, it is less effective against adultBrugia malayi,one of the causative agents of human lymphatic filariasis. Characterizing molecular and pharmacological disparities between highly conserved splice variant isoforms ofB. malayiandO. volvulusSLO-1 K channels and identifying allosteric modulators that can increase emodepside potency onB. malayiSLO-1 K channels is necessary for therapeutic advance. In this study, we tested the effects of emodepside and the mammalian BK channel activator, GoSlo-SR-5–69 alone and in combination onXenopusexpressedB. malayiSLO-1F andO. volvulusSLO-1A channels. Additionally, binding poses of emodepside, and GoSlo-SR-5–69 were predicted on both channels using molecular docking. We observed thatOvo-SLO-1A was more sensitive to emodepside thanBma-SLO-1F, with EC50values of 0.40 ± 0.05 µM and 1.4 ± 0.2 µM forOvo-SLO-1A andBma-SLO-1F respectively. GoSlo-SR-5–69 lacked agonist activity on both channel isoforms but acted as a positive allosteric modulator, potentiating the effects of emodepside. Molecular docking analysis revealed that emodepside binds at the S6 pocket below the selectivity filter forBma-SLO-1F andOvo-SLO-1A. In contrast, GoSlo-SR-5–69 binds at the RCK1 pocket. This study reveals for the first time, allosteric modulation of filarial nematode SLO-1 K channels by a mammalian BK channel activator and highlights its ability to increase emodepside potency on theB. malayiSLO-1 K channel.",

This study investigates the spatio-temporal characteristics of thunderstorms and lightning in Ghana, emphasizing their relationships with atmospheric instability indices, including Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE), relative humidity (RH), and the Lifted Index (LI). Using data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) lightning imaging sensor (LIS), ERA-5 reanalysis, NCEP Reanalysis Derived data and four key stations—Accra, Axim, Kumasi, and Bole—thunderstorm frequencies, inter-annual and seasonal variabilities, and the spatial distribution of lightning flash rate density were analyzed. Temporal climatologies were computed for lightning activity alongside CAPE, RH at multiple atmospheric levels (200 hPa, 500 hPa, and 925 hPa), and LI. The findings reveal distinct bimodal and unimodal trends in thunderstorm occurrences, mirroring Ghana’s rainfall patterns in the south and north, respectively. Notably, at least 25% of thunderstorms were not associated with rainfall, challenging conventional rainfall-lightning distribution theories. Lightning activity exhibited a marked north-to-south gradient, suggesting a more nuanced relationship influenced by CAPE and RH under specific atmospheric conditions. The study highlights the influence of the Inter-Tropical Discontinuity (ITD) on thunderstorm migration and intensity, as well as its interactions with lightning, CAPE, RH, and LI. Importantly, while ITD movement contributes to thunderstorm dynamics, lightning distribution is more dependent on sufficient atmospheric moisture. The results suggest a linear relationship among CAPE, LI, RH, and lightning activity, offering essential insights into the dynamics of convective storms in Ghana, West Africa.. These findings provide a reliable baseline for understanding thunderstorm and lightning characteristics, offering valuable guidance for disaster risk reduction efforts by organizations such as the Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet) and the National Disaster Management Organization (NADMO), particularly in data-sparse regions.",

    "title": "Troika algorithm: Approximate optimization for accurate clique partitioning and clustering of weighted networks",
    "abstract": "Clique partitioning is the fundamental network clustering task of identifying an optimal node partition for a weighted graph according to the real-valued edge weights. An optimal partition is one that maximizes the sum of within-cluster edge weights over all possible node partitions. This paper introduces a novel approximation algorithm, namedTroika, to solve this NP-hard problem in small to mid-sized networks for instances of theoretical and practical relevance. Troika uses a branch-and-cut scheme for branching on node triples to find a partition that is within a user-specified optimality gap tolerance. Troika offers advantages over alternative methods for clique partitioning like heuristics and integer programming solvers. Unlike heuristics, Troika returns solutions within a guaranteed proximity to global optimality. Compared to the integer programming solver, Gurobi, Troika is faster for most benchmark instances. Besides its advantages for solving the clique partitioning problem, we demonstrate the applications of Troika in community detection and portfolio analysis. Troika returns partitions with higher proximity to optimal compared to eight modularity-based community detection algorithms. When used on networks of correlations among stocks, Troika reveals the dynamic changes in the structure of portfolio networks including downturns from the 2008 financial crisis and the reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our comprehensive results based on benchmarks from the literature and new real and random networks point to Troika as a reliable and accurate method for solving clique partitioning instances with up to 5000 edges on standard hardware.",

    "title": "Catalyzing computational biology research at an academic institute through an interest network",
    "abstract": "Biology has been transformed by the rapid development of computing and the concurrent rise of data-rich approaches such as, omics or high-resolution imaging. However, there is a persistent computational skills gap in the biomedical research workforce. Inherent limitations of classroom teaching and institutional core support highlight the need for accessible ways for researchers to explore developments in computational biology. An analysis of the Scripps Research Genomics Core revealed increases in the total number and diversity of experiments: the share of experiments other than bulk RNA- or DNA-sequencing increased from 34% to 60% within 10 years, requiring more tailored computational analyses. These challenges were tackled by forming a volunteer-led affinity group of approximately 300 academic biomedical researchers interested in computational biology, referred to as the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB) affinity group. This adaptive group has provided continuing education and networking opportunities through seminars, workshops, and coding sessions while evolving along with the needs of its members. A survey of CBB’s impact confirmed the group’s events increased the members’ exposure to computational biology educational and research events (79% respondents) and networking opportunities (61% respondents). Thus, volunteer-led affinity groups may be a viable complement to traditional institutional resources for enhancing the application of computing in biomedical research.",

    "title": "Personalizing chemotherapy drug selection using a novel transcriptomic chemogram",
    "abstract": "Gene signatures predictive of chemotherapeutic response have the potential to extend the reach of precision medicine by allowing oncologists to optimize treatment for individuals. Most published predictive signatures are only capable of predicting response for individual drugs, but most chemotherapy regimens utilize combinations of different agents. We propose a unified framework, called the chemogram, that uses predictive signatures to rank the relative predicted sensitivity of different drugs for individual tumors. Using this approach, providers could efficiently screen against many therapeutics to optimize chemotherapy at any time, whether it be for a treatment-naive tumor or a chemo-resistant tumor requiring a new treatment strategy. To demonstrate the utility of the chemogram, we used predictive signatures (extracted from a previously established method) in our framework to rank predicted sensitivity among drugs within cell lines. We then compared the rank order of predicted and observed response against each drug. Across most cancer types, chemogram-generated predictions were more accurate than predictions made by randomly generated gene signatures, signatures extracted from differential expression alone, and was comparable to another established method of drug response prediction. Our framework demonstrates the ability of transcriptomic signatures to not only predict chemotherapeutic response, but also correctly assign rankings of drug sensitivity on an individual basis. Additionally, scaling the chemogram to include more drugs does not compromise accuracy.",

    "title": "Epithelial competition determines gene therapy potential to suppress Fanconi Anemia oral cancer risk",
    "abstract": "Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a heritable syndrome characterized by DNA damage repair deficits, frequent malformations and a significantly elevated risk of bone marrow failure, leukemia, and mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy can prevent marrow failure and lower leukemia risk, but mucosal gene therapy to lower HNSCC risk remains untested. Major knowledge gaps include an incomplete understanding of how rapidly gene-corrected cellular lineages could spread through the oral epithelium, and which delivery parameters are critical for ensuring efficient gene correction. To answer these questions, we extended an agent-based model of the oral epithelium to include the delivery of gene correctionin situto FA cells and the competitive dynamics between cellular lineages with and without gene correction. We found that only gene-corrected lineages with substantial proliferative advantages (probability of resisting displacement out of the basal layer) could spread on clinically relevant timelines, and that these lineages were initially at high risk of loss in the generations following correction. Delivering gene correction to many cells minimizes the risk of loss, while delivery to many distinct locations within a tissue maximizes the rate of spread. To determine the impact of mucosal gene therapy in preventing the clonal expansion of pre-cancerous mutations, we compared the expected burden ofTP53mutations in simulated tissue sections with and without gene correction. We found that when FA cells have elevated genome instability or aTP53-dependent proliferative advantage, gene correction can substantially reduce the accumulation of pro-tumorigenic mutations. This model illustrates the power of computational frameworks to identify critical determinants of therapeutic success to enable experimental optimization and support novel and effective gene therapy applications.",

    "title": "Ant visual route navigation: How the fine details of behaviour promote successful route performance and convergence",
    "abstract": "Individually foraging ants use egocentric views as a dominant navigation strategy for learning and retracing routes. Evidence suggests that route retracing can be achieved by algorithms which use views as ‘visual compasses’, where individuals choose the heading that leads to the most familiar visual scene when compared to route memories. However, such a mechanism does not naturally lead to route approach, and alternative strategies are required to enable convergence when off-route and for correcting on-route divergence. In this work we investigate how behaviour incorporated into visual compass like route learning and recapitulation strategies might enable convergence to a learned route and its destination. Without alterations to the basic form of the initial learning route, the most successful recapitulation method comes from a ‘cast and surge’ approach, a mechanism seen across arthropods for olfactory navigation. In this strategy casts form a ‘zig-zagged’ or oscillatory search in space for familiar views, and surges exploit visual familiarity gradients. We also find that performance improves if the learned route consists of an oscillatory motor mechanism with learning gated to occur when the agent approaches the central axis of the oscillation. Furthermore, such oscillations combined with the cast and surge method additively enhance performance, showing that it benefits to incorporate oscillatory behaviour in both learning and recapitulation. As destination reaching is the primary goal of navigation, we show that a suitably sized goal-orientated learning walk might suffice, but that the scale of this is dependent on the degree of divergence, and thus depends on route length and the route learning and recapitulation strategies used. Finally we show that view familiarity can modulate on-the-spot scans performed by an agent, providing a better reflection of ant behaviour. Overall, our results show that the visual compass can provide a basis for robust visual navigation, so long as it is considered holistically with the details of basic motor and sensory-motor patterns of ants undertaking route learning and recapitulation.",

    "title": "In silico biophysics and rheology of blood and red blood cells in Gaucher Disease",
    "abstract": "Gaucher Disease (GD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, leading to the accumulation of glucosylceramide in various cells, including red blood cells (RBCs). This accumulation results in altered biomechanical properties and rheological behavior of RBCs, which may play an important role in blood rheology and the development of bone infarcts, avascular necrosis (AVN) and other bone diseases associated with GD. In this study, dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations are employed to investigate the biomechanics and rheology of blood and RBCs in GD under various flow conditions. The model incorporates the unique characteristics of GD RBCs, such as decreased deformability and increased aggregation properties, and aims to capture the resulting changes in RBC biophysics and blood viscosity. This study is the first to explore the Young’s modulus and aggregation parameters of GD RBCs by validating simulations with confocal imaging and experimental RBC disaggregation thresholds. Throughin silicosimulations, we examine the impact of hematocrit, RBC disaggregation threshold, and cell stiffness on blood viscosity in GD. The results reveal three distinct domains of GD blood viscosity based on shear rate: the aggregation domain, where the RBC disaggregation threshold predominantly influences blood viscosity; the transition area, where both RBC aggregation and stiffness impact on blood viscosity; and the stiffness domain, where the stiffness of RBCs emerges as the primary determinant of blood viscosity. By analyzing RBC mechanical properties and blood viscosity in relation to bone disease, we find that the RBC aggregation properties, deformability, and blood viscosity, may contribute to its onset. These findings enhance our understanding of how changes in RBC properties impact on blood viscosity and may affect bone health, offering a partial explanation for the bone complications observed in GD patients.",

    "abstract": "It is possible that the negative attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination developed by some people, such as self-identified Republicans, might spill over toward other vaccines. We conducted a survey experiment to investigate if mentioning COVID-19 vaccine in messages encouraging seasonal flu vaccination will negatively affect people’s attitudes toward receiving a flu vaccine. The experiment was embedded in a survey fielded in South Dakota in April 2024. Participants were registered voters in the state. We used difference-of-means tests and logistic regression to analyze the data. Results showed no statistically significant differences between the participants in control and treatment groups regarding the likelihood of receiving a flu vaccine (OR: 1.012, CI: 0.594 - 1.724) or their belief in the safety of the flu vaccine (OR: 1.333, CI: 0.707- 2.511). We observed the same patterns when we only looked at Republicans. Attitudes toward flu vaccination were primarily driven by peoples’ current flu vaccination status. We found that mentioning COVID-19 vaccines in flu vaccination messages did not negatively affect people’s attitudes toward flu vaccine. Public health workers and officials might not need to shy away from mentioning COVID-19 vaccines when communicating other vaccines.",

    "abstract": "On January 26th2024, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) recognized plausible grounds for genocide being committed in Gaza by Israel. A hallmark of the violence has been unprecedented attacks on health workers since October 7th, 2023. We use the word “genocide” to refer to this period of accelerated violence and displacement in Gaza, following ICJ findings, detailed reports by human rights organizations, and statements by genocide scholars concluding that Israel is indeed committing genocide. To assess impacts of this violence, between December 2023 and January 2024 we conducted an anonymous cross-sectional online survey of physicians and nurses working in Gaza prior to and during the genocide. Participants reported on workplace displacement, personal losses, and psychological impacts using the Professional Quality of Life Scale for Health Workers (ProQOL-H). 56 participants completed one or more survey components. Among 46 participants reporting on displacement, 25 (54%) reported having to change workplaces at least once. Among 41 participants documenting personal loss, 17 (41%) reported that a family member was killed and 32 (78%) reported that a close colleague was killed. Among 35 participants completing the ProQOL-H, 17 (49%) respondents reported “high” compassion satisfaction (scores of 24–30), 13 (37%) reported high burnout, and 13 (37%) reported high secondary traumatic stress. This is markedly different from CS, BO, and STS scores reported by nurses in the West Bank in a recent study, likely reflecting the genocide in Gaza. Further work with survivors is needed to characterize their experiences and reconcile them with culture-specific coping strategies such assumud.Culturally relevant, mixed methods follow up to this work is needed to inform interventions to support the recovery of survivors and rebuild Gaza’s healthcare system. This will only be possible when the genocide is brought to a permanent end, along with the conditions which have enabled it.",

    "title": "Wastewater analysis of chemical markers of public health concern at small spatial scales: A scoping review",
    "abstract": "Wastewater analysis is a promising approach to obtaining population-based health information. It has proven useful for different applications, including monitoring illicit drugs or assessing population-level exposure to chemicals. Studies have often analysed samples from wastewater treatment plants, which does not allow for small-scale intra-sewershed differentiations needed for a detailed assessment of the target population. The small-scale approach offers various benefits, but a comprehensive review of its application to chemicals has not yet been undertaken. This scoping review aims to provide a detailed overview of the current knowledge on wastewater analysis of chemical markers of public health concern, including methodological aspects. We conducted a systematic database search for peer-reviewed articles. Data were analysed using quantitative summaries and qualitative narrative synthesis. Out of 2283 articles, 99 studies were included. Most were published after 2010. The studies analysed wastewater from different settings, with a focus on points of interest such as healthcare and education facilities, and few studies at neighbourhood-level. Pharmaceuticals, industrial and environmental chemicals and stimulants were most commonly investigated. While most studies reported their sampling mode, few provided detailed specifications. Small-scale sampling sites were characterized to varying degrees, with many studies reporting only a single characterization criterion. Advancing the area of research of small-scale wastewater analysis requires consistent and transparent methodological reporting and a more detailed sampling site characterization. Wastewater analysis of chemical markers of public health concern at small spatial scales shows great potential for further public health applications, including occupational health and monitoring chemical exposure in schools.",

    "title": "Potential impact, costs, and benefits of population-wide screening interventions for tuberculosis in Viet Nam: A mathematical modelling study",
    "abstract": "Population-wide screening may accelerate the decline of tuberculosis (TB) incidence, but the optimal screening algorithm and duration must weigh resource considerations. We calibrated a deterministic transmission model to TB epidemiology in Viet Nam. We simulated three population-wide screening algorithms from 2025: sputum nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT, Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra) only; chest radiography (CXR) followed by NAAT; and CXR-only without microbiological confirmation. We determined the annual screening rounds required to reduce pulmonary TB prevalence below 50 per 100,000 people. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), representing the additional costs (in US$) per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted compared to business-as-usual by 2050. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of NAAT cartridges costing US$1 each. NAAT-based algorithms required at least six rounds to reach the prevalence threshold, while CXR-only required three. NAAT-only achieved a prevalence reduction consistent with the ACT3 trial after three rounds. The CXR+NAAT algorithm averted 4.29m DALYs (95%UI:2.86-6.14) at US$225 (95%UI:85–520) per DALY averted compared with business-as-usual. The front-loaded investment of US$161m (95%UI:111–224) annually during the intervention resulted in average annual cost savings of US$12.7m (95%UI:6.7-21.4) up to 2050 compared to the business-as-usual counterfactual. Reducing the cost of NAAT to US$1 led to a 50% and 15% reduction in budget impact and a 63% and 26% reduction in the estimated ICER for the NAAT-only and CXR+NAAT algorithms, respectively. In Viet Nam, population-wide screening could achieve ambitious policy goals. Substantial front-loaded investment is immediately followed by persistent cost savings and could be further offset by more affordable NAATs.",

    "abstract": "For digital health interventions, the “gold standard” of evaluating effectiveness is the randomized control trial (RCT). Yet, RCT methodology presents issues such as precluding changes to the technology during the study period as well as the use of study settings that do not reflect “real world” contexts. In this paper, we draw on empirical material from our ethnographic research on an app-based program called HIVSmart!, which is a digital strategy designed to support people in the process of HIV self-testing. We explore how this digital health approach was made to work in different contexts, and what this means for monitoring and evaluation of digital health interventions. Our analysis reveals that making technology which is “ease to use” depends on various user practices developed over time and the multiple, shifting users who define this ease of use. Furthermore, it shows that asking whether an app is “working” provides different answers at different moments, as the technology, as well as the human and physical supports around it, change and adapt over time. Therefore, questions around the feasibility of the technology, as well as ongoing monitoring efforts, need to be developed in a way that capture this fluctuation in the technology and its surroundings. Based on our insights, we contribute to implementation science approaches in the field of digital health by putting forward recommendations regarding how we can assess the effectiveness of digital health tools.",

    "title": "Bearing Witness:Témoignageas a Tool for Child Advocacy during Armed Conflict",
    "abstract": "Children affected by armed conflict suffer devastating physical, emotional, and social harm. War uproots families, forcing many to flee as refugees or internally displaced persons, while others remain trapped in dangerous environments. In these crises, children face disproportionate risks—violence, exploitation, disrupted education, and collapsed healthcare systems. Their unique vulnerabilities require urgent, targeted action to protect their health, rights, and development. Beyond immediate care, the humanitarian principle of témoignage—bearing witness—is essential. Rooted in humanitarian ethics, témoignage means speaking out about injustice, amplifying the voices of those affected, and driving systemic change. It challenges traditional notions of neutrality and calls on humanitarian professionals to ethically advocate for those they serve. Pediatricians and pediatric organizations have a moral duty to ensure that children affected by conflict are seen, heard, and not forgotten. This commentary calls for recognizing children’s distinct humanitarian rights and urges global pediatric societies to take action. To guide this effort, the paper introduces a framework of seven pillars of pediatric témoignage: 1. Amplifying children’s voices, 2. Advocating for systemic justice, 3. Providing trauma-informed care, 4. Supporting education and psychosocial integration, 5. Advancing training and research, 6. Building professional and community networks, and 7. Creating platforms for policy influence. These pillars offer a shared language and practical strategies for pediatricians to document harm, collaborate with advocacy groups, and speak out in public forums. Through témoignage, pediatricians can help protect children’s dignity and rights, ensure their suffering is not normalized, and contribute to a more just and responsive global system for children in conflict.",

    "abstract": "The recent withdrawal of U.S. financial support threatens essential TB service delivery, including diagnostics, treatment, TB-HIV co-infection interventions and research initiatives critical to eradicating TB. This study analyses the dependency of and potential impact of funding cuts to 26 high-burden TB countries (HBCs). We modelled three recovery scenarios: (1) minimal impact (services recover within three months), (2) moderate impact (recovery within one year), and (3) worst-case scenario (long-term service reduction). Extrapolations were made for all 26 HBCs based on representative countries from each dependency category. Across all 26 HBCs, additional TB cases between 2025 and 2030 are estimated at 0.63 million (CI 0.45–0.81) (minimal impact), 1.66 million (CI 1.2–2.1) (moderate impact), and 10.67 million (CI 7.85–13.19) (worst-case). Corresponding TB deaths are projected to increase by 99,900 (CI 65,200–130,000), 268,600 (CI 185,800–337,900), and 2,243,700 (CI 1,570,800–2,807,300), respectively. The loss of U.S. funding endangers global TB control efforts, jeopardizing progress towards End TB and SDG targets, and potentially puts millions of lives at risk. While some nations may adapt, short-term disruptions will severely impact vulnerable populations. Urgent alternative funding is needed to sustain critical TB prevention and treatment efforts.",

Adherence to cervical cancer screening was assessed based on the timing of their last Papanicolaou (PAP) smear, with participants classified as non-adherent to cervical cancer guidelines if their last PAP smear was > 3 years. Further, participants were asked about their knowledge of the HPV vaccine and were categorized as unaware if they had not heard of it before. Survey-weighted Poisson regression models adjusted for age, race, and education were used to explore both adherence and HPV vaccination knowledge before and following the COVID-19 pandemic. We included 1,905 females with a mean age of 44.5 years, 61.3% were White, and 35.4% had a college education or higher. The prevalence of non-adherence in 2019 was 19.2% and increased by 6.6% in 2022. White adults showed an increase of 5.6%, while Black adults showed an increase of 13.9%. When exploring changes in HPV vaccination knowledge, 18.9% did not hear about the HPV vaccine in 2019, which slightly increased by 2.8% in 2022. Being Black and having lower education were significantly associated with both greater non-adherence rates and not hearing about HPV vaccine. Non-adherence to cervical cancer screening increased following the COVID-19 pandemic, especially amongst under-represented communities including Black adults and those with lower education. This trend was also reflected in reduced awareness of HPV vaccination. Further studies are needed to elucidate barriers associated with greater non-adherence rates and to explore targeted interventions, such as educational campaigns, community outreach programs, and initiatives to improve access for underserved populations, which may promote more equitable screening uptake and healthcare access.",

    "abstract": "Retention on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is critical for achieving viral load suppression (VLS) among people living with HIV (PLHIV). Retention remains challenging in high-prevalence settings like Malawi. Short messaging service (SMS) interventions, particularly hybrid two-way texting (2wT), show promise in improving ART retention. We conducted a randomized control trial (RCT) at Lighthouse Trust in Lilongwe, Malawi, to evaluate the effectiveness of a hybrid 2wT system to improve compliance to ART refill appointments, early retention, and VLS among new ART initiates. After receiving routine ART initiation counseling, 442 clients with mobile phones on ART ≤ six months were randomized to 2wT or standard of care (SoC). The 2wT group received weekly motivational messages, appointment reminders, and access to an open-ended SMS communication channel with retention officers. The SoC group received peer support at clinic visits and reminder calls, pre-visit and for missed appointments. All participants were traced if they missed an appointment by >14 days. Study outcomes ascertained six months post ART initiation included: ART appointment compliance (attending within 2 days), retention in care (alive on ART), and VLS (< 200 copies). Data from electronic medical records were analyzed using Chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression. Data on 2wT participation were extracted from the 2wT database and summarized using Microsoft Excel. At six months, the 2wT group demonstrated higher compliance to ART refill visits compared to SoC (59.6% vs. 46.8%, p = 0.008). Among 2wT participants, 86% responded to ≥ 1 message, suggesting strong engagement with 2wT. The platform sent 1,645 reminders: all participants received visit reminders with the majority receiving multiple pre-appointment and follow-up messages. However, 2wT did not significantly improve retention or VLS at 6 months. Over 91% of both 2wT and SoC were retained in care (p = 0.969), and higher VLS among 2wT (97.5%) vs. SoC (93.2%) was not significant (p = 0.07). Implementing a larger 2wT study over 12–24 months and among more clients could provide evidence of 2wT impact on retention and VLS. Overall, the enhanced ART visit compliance and high care engagement among 2wT participants suggests that the low-tech, highly-accepted, 2wT approach could provide a scalable, appropriate complement to existing retention interventions in low-resource settings.",

    "abstract": "Humanitarian crises, particularly in conflict zones, create cascading disruptions that impact every aspect of daily life, including health and disease outcomes. While international humanitarian frameworks categorize these crises into discrete operational clusters, affected populations experience them as interwoven, systemic failures. This study examines how conflict-induced disruptions transform a preventable and typically self-limiting disease—Hepatitis A—into a fatal outcome. Using a systems approach, we seek to characterize the architecture of interconnected disruptions leading to preventable deaths. This study employed the FAIR (Fairness, Agency, Inclusion, and Representation) Framework, a participatory methodology centering community epistemes, to analyze four pediatric cases of Hepatitis A that progressed to fulminant liver failure. Data were obtained through interviews with healthcare providers, caregivers, and community members, supplemented by medical chart reviews. A network-based Architecture of Systems (AoS) map was constructed to visualize interconnections between war-induced systemic disruptions and health outcomes. Network analysis identified key nodes and pathways within the systems map. The findings of this study reveal a complex system of war-driven factors including displacement, destruction of healthcare infrastructure, water scarcity, food deprivation, and fuel blockades that collectively reshaped disease trajectories. Network analysis of the AoS map identified 138 nodes and 231 edges, generating 34,458 pathways linking conflict-related disruptions to health outcomes. Women’s health emerged as a central mediator, with 97% of pathways intersecting with 25 key nodes including women’s roles in caregiving, resource acquisition, and psychological stability. The lack of access to food and clean water, combined with the destruction of healthcare facilities and restrictions on medical evacuation, created conditions where preventable, self-limiting diseases become fatal. This study highlights how conflict restructures health determinants, turning survival strategies into pathways of increasing morbidity and mortality. It also underscores the need for a systems-based humanitarian response that considers the intersecting pathways driving outcomes in crisis settings.",

    "abstract": "Reproductive coercion (RC) and intimate partner violence (IPV) are prevalent in Kenya and undermine women’s reproductive agency; community-based women’s groups may offer an opportunity to address these issues. We quantitatively examined women’s participation in women-only self-help groups, described discussions of RC within these groups, and assessed differences based on prior experiences of RC and IPV among a clinic-based sample of Kenyan women seeking family planning services to inform future programming. Data were collected from 659 women of reproductive age seeking family planning services at six private clinics in Nairobi as part of the baseline for an intervention to address RC and IPV within family planning counseling. We used descriptive statistics, bivariate hypothesis testing, and adjusted mixed-effect logistic regression models to examine the relationship between self-help group participation and lifetime experience of RC and IPV. Using the same methods, we analyzed group discussions about RC in relation to lifetime experiences of abuse among women who had recently participated in groups. Additionally, we explored associations between RC discussions and the type of self-help group (e.g., economic, charitable) using bivariate tests. Over half of women reported prior participation in women-only self-help groups, with most participating in economic groups (63%). More than one in two women reported prior IPV and one in three reported prior RC. Self-help group participation was not significantly associated with prior experiences of RC or IPV. However, women who had ever experienced RC were more likely to report discussions about RC within groups (AOR 1.82 95% CI 1.06-3.14). Discussions of RC were less common in economic groups. Women-only self-help group participation is common and acceptable among Kenyan women, including those experiencing violence. However, economic groups—though widespread—discuss RC less often, indicating a key opportunity to integrate RC/IPV programming into these settings to strengthen community-based support.",

    "abstract": "This paper sought to identify and describe the innovations and adaptations implemented to ensure delivery of Sexual and Reproductive Health services during the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential for enhancing SRH services in other settings or in future emergencies. We searched five databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL. The review was registered on Prospero (CRD42022329411). The open call was launched and promoted widely; each submission was screened by five independent reviewers. The GRADE-CERQual methodology was used to assess confidence in each study finding. A thematic synthesis approach was employed for textual data and for studies with similar outcomes, a fixed effects model was employed. We identified 10,891 citations and 78 studies were included. We received 80 submissions to the open call, and 18 submissions contributed to the study findings. Submissions came from 42 countries, most of which were LMICs (37/42). Telemedicine was one main mode of continuing SRH services during the pandemic (moderate certainty). Teleabortion, or the provision of medication abortion remotely via telemedicine, was found to be a safe and effective way to maintain abortion service (97·9% of cases with 95% CI = 95·6 to 99·4%). However, increased reliance on telemedicine exacerbates inequities for low-income and rural populations. Self-care and self-testing enabled individuals to receive care for STIs (moderate certainty). This work identified strategies used to deliver SRH services during COVID-19 and the data suggest that many strategies relied on telemedicine to sustain SRH services. Self-care interventions were also used to sustain delivery of SRH services. There is need for further research to understand the long-term impact of these interventions and how they can be sustained over time.",

    "title": "Promoting holistic wellbeing during the polycrisis: An essay on inner development through the martial art of Wing Chun",
    "abstract": "This essay explores the traditional martial art of Wing Chun through a psychological lens of inner development for holistic wellbeing. Originating in Southern China, Wing Chun emphasises fluidity, adaptability, and effectiveness, guided by five core principles: Simplicity, Practicality, Efficiency, Effectiveness, and Directness (SPEED). Grounded in Buddhist and Taoist philosophies, these principles provide a foundation for understanding and promoting psychological wellbeing. We propose a novel psychological framework that maps these principles to psychological constructs, includingRadical non-attachment,Embodied empowerment, skilfulAdaptation, self-Control, and psychologicalHardiness (REACH). Each construct within the REACH model functions synergistically, providing an opportunity for holistic cultivation of a resilient and adaptable mindset, grounded in mindful awareness, psychological flexibility, and fierce compassion. Radical nonattachment (underpinned by the principle of simplicity) facilitates a socially-engaged mindfulness, supported by a compassionate awareness of self, others and nature. Embodied empowerment (effectiveness) enables navigation of internal and external cues with greater agency while promoting a deeper sense of groundedness and engagement with the world. Skillful adaptation (practicality) promotes flexibility, creativity and the experience of psychological flow, supporting dynamic engagement with the environment. Self-control (efficiency) supports nonconscious regulation, facilitating purposeful goal-setting with reduced cognitive effort. Psychological hardiness (directness) supports the development of fierce compassion, transforming adversity into growth and enhancing capacity for working toward social justice and resisting dominant social narratives. Presented as an opportunity to promote power resources, these interrelated constructs bridge martial practice, mindful awareness, and social engagement, providing a robust foundation for psychological interventions supporting inner development and wellbeing at multiple scales, focused on self, others and nature.",

    "abstract": "Post-secondary students report high levels of stress and mental health challenges. Identifying the key sources of stress can guide efforts to mitigate the most significant stressors and better support students’ mental health. The Post-Secondary Student Stressors Index (PSSI), a 46-item inventory, was designed to comprehensively assess stressors specific to post-secondary students. However, its dimensional structure and its association with mental health indices require further validation. In the present study, a Principal Component Analysis was conducted to examine the structure of the PSSI, and the associations between the resulting stressor components and several mental health indices. Participants included 1,214 first-year students (Mage= 18.14 years, SD = 0.95), who completed the PSSI, as well as measures of perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. Results suggested 12 components that accounted for 42 of the original 46 items, with most components demonstrating moderate to high internal consistency (α = .70 -.90). Correlational analyses revealed positive associations between the PSSI components and measures of perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms, although components with lower endorsements were associated with weaker correlations. By identifying valid and reliable components of the PSSI, this study facilitates the use of specific stressor components in future research on student stress and mental health.",

    "abstract": "Mental health disorders are a significant global health concern. Timely access to psychiatric care is crucial for positive treatment outcomes. However, the path to care followed can vary greatly. Understanding these pathways is essential for identifying potential delays in accessing treatment. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the pathway to care and the time to treatment among patients attending psychiatry services. The cross-sectional study was conducted from July to October 2023. A systematic random sampling technique was employed to recruit a sample of 424 participants. Data were collected using questionnaires. The Epi-collect smartphone application was used to collect data and then data was exported and analyzed using SPSS version 26. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with paths to psychiatric care. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The magnitude of direct pathway to care, and delayed treatment was 5.9% (95% CI: 3.9-8.6%) and 51.7% (95% CI: 46.8-56.5%) respectively. Several factors were associated with the direct pathway to care. Younger adults (AOR: 2.80, 95% CI: 1.384, 7.276), males (AOR: 3.0, 95% CI: 2.048, 6.037), and those with schizophrenia (AOR: 2.4, 95%CI: 1.6, 4.8) were more likely to use direct pathway to psychiatry care. In contrast, Poor social support, low mental health literacy, lack of awareness about treatment availability and greater distance to a health facility were associated with a decreased likelihood of taking direct pathway to psychiatric care. This study found limited use of direct pathways to psychiatric care. Poor social support, low mental health literacy, lack of awareness about treatment availability and greater distance to a health facility were associated with a decreased likelihood of taking a direct pathway to psychiatric care.",

Our study utilized data from a three-year prospective study of 4,806 smartwatch users who completed daily questionnaires, and a panel study surveying 2,536 individuals twice. Stress symptoms were measured daily, while PCL-5 and GAD-7 questionnaires assessed PTSD and anxiety prevalence. After October 7, stress levels soared, with PTSD prevalence reaching 22.9-36.0% at 7–8 weeks post-event, and remaining exceptionally high at 15.9-24.7% after 7 months. We found a strong correlation between increased PTSD risk and extensive media consumption. Smartwatch data revealed early PTSD markers such as pronounced increases in stress levels and declines in mood, physical activity, and sleep quality within the first week. This study underscores the significant impact of media exposure on PTSD development and the value of continuous physiological monitoring for early detection of PTSD after mass traumatic events.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs) are potent antigen-presenting cells and play a key role in facilitating the sexual transmission of HIV, functioning as a delivery system responsible for trafficking the virus from exposed barrier sites to their key target cells, CD4 T cells. Although the role of DCs in HIV transmission is well established, the recent advent of high-parameter, single-cell detection technologies, coupled with improved cell isolation techniques, has led to the rapid reclassification of the DC landscape, particularly within human barrier tissues. The identification of new subsets introduces the challenge of incorporating previously understood transmission principles with new, cell-specific, functional nuances to identify the key DCs responsible for facilitating HIV infection. This review explores the history of research linking DCs with HIV transmission as well as our understanding of how HIV manipulates DC biology to achieve this purpose. Furthermore, it provides an up-to-date understanding of the antigen-presenting cell landscape within human anogenital tissues and how each subset contributes to sexual transmission. Uncovering the cells and biological processes responsible for the sexual transmission of HIV is a fundamental step in the pursuit of an HIV vaccine and better prophylaxis to block infection.",

    "abstract": "Neuroinflammation within the central nervous system (CNS) is recognized as a critical pathological process in meningiticEscherichia coli(E. coli) infection, leading to severe neurodegenerative disorders and long-term sequelae. Astrocyte reactivity plays a pivotal role in driving the neuroinflammatory cascade in response to pathological stimuli from peripheral sources or other cellular components of the CNS. The involvement of astrocyte reactivity in the inflammatory process induced by bacterial infection within the CNS warrants further investigation. In this study, we observed an astrocyte reaction likely mediated by brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) during meningiticE. coliinfection in both a mouse model and a BMEC-astrocyte coculture system. Through label-free quantitative proteomics analysis of the BMEC secretome, we identified CK2 as a potential trigger for astrocyte reactivity. Inhibition of CK2 attenuated the reaction of hippocampal astrocytes inE. colimeningitis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CK2 enhances NF-κB activationviaits interaction with myosin 9, thereby increasing astrocyte reactivity and the inflammatory response bothin vivoandin vitro. By conditionally knocking out CK2β in microvessel, we blocked CK2 secretion, resulting in reduced astrocyte reactivity and neuroinflammation during the early stages of infection. Compared to wild-type mice,CK2βVas-/-mice exhibited a significantly higher survival rate. Collectively, our findings highlight the essential role of endothelial-glial communication mediated by CK2 interaction with myosin 9 in activating the downstream NF-κB pathway, contributing to astrocyte reactivity and neuroinflammation. These results provide novel insights into the treatment of CNS inflammation caused by bacterial blood-borne infections.",

Here, we identify cathepsin Z (Ctsz) as a lead candidate underlying this TB susceptibility and show thatCtszablation leads to increased bacterial burden, pulmonary inflammation and decreased survival in mice.Ctszdisturbance within murine macrophages enhances production of chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), a known biomarker of TB severity. From a Ugandan household contact study, we identify significant associations betweenCTSZvariants and TB disease severity. Finally, we examine patient-derived TB granulomas and report CTSZ localization within granuloma-associated macrophages, placing human CTSZ at the host–pathogen interface. These findings implicate a conserved CTSZ-CXCL1 axis in humans and genetically diverse mice that mediates TB disease severity.",

    "abstract": "Morphogenetic information arises from a combination of genetically encoded cellular properties and emergent cellular behaviors. The spatio-temporal implementation of this information is critical to ensure robust, reproducible tissue shapes, yet the principles underlying its organization remain unknown. We investigated this principle using the mouse auditory epithelium, the organ of Corti (OC). OC consists of a sensory domain, which transduces sound through polar mechanosensory hair cells (HC), part of a mosaic with supporting cells (SC). On either side of the sensory domain are non-sensory domains. These domains undergo cellular rearrangements, which, together, lead to a spiral cochlea that contains planar polarized HCs. This makes the mammalian cochlea a compelling system to understand coordination across spatial scales. Using genetic and ex vivo approaches, we found patterning of OC into sensory and non-sensory domains is associated with a combinatorial expression of adhesion molecules, which underpins OC into spatially defined compartments, enabling planar cell polarity (PCP) cues to regulate compartment-specific organization. Through compartment-specific knockouts of the PCP protein, Vangl2, we find evidence of compartment coupling, a non-linear influence on the organization within one compartment when cellular organization is disrupted in another. In the OC, compartment coupling originates from vinculin-dependent junctional mechanics, coordinating cellular dynamics across spatial scales.",

    "abstract": "Research into the mechanisms underlying neuromodulation by tES using in-vivo animal models is key to overcoming experimental limitations in humans and essential to building a detailed understanding of the in-vivo consequences of tES. Insights from such animal models are needed to develop targeted and effective therapeutic applications of non-invasive brain stimulation in humans. The sheer difference in scale and geometry between animal models and the human brain contributes to the complexity of designing and interpreting animal studies. Here, we introduce EFMouse, a toolbox that extends previous approaches to model intracranial electric fields and generate predictions that can be tested with in-vivo recordings in mice. Novel functionality includes the ability to capture typical surgical approaches in the mouse (e.g., cranial recording windows), the placement of stimulation electrodes anywhere in or on the animal, and novel ways to report field predictions, including some refined measures of focality and direction homogeneity, and quantification based on regions defined in the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas. Although the EFMouse toolbox is generally applicable to planning and designing tES studies in mice, we illustrate its use by posing questions about transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) experiments with the goal of targeting the left visual cortex of the mouse.

    "title": "Shrinking to bird size with dinosaur-level cancer defences: Evolution of cancer suppression over macroevolutionary time",
    "abstract": "Ubiquity of cancer across the tree of life yields opportunities to understand variation in cancer defences across species. Peto’s paradox, the finding that large-bodied species do not suffer from more cancer despite having more cells at risk of oncogenic mutations compared to small species, can be explained if large size selects for better cancer defences. Since birds live longer than non-flying mammals of equivalent size, and are descendants of moderate-sized dinosaurs, we ask whether ancestral cancer defences are retained if body size shrinks in a lineage. Our model derives selection coefficients and fixation events for changes in cancer defences over macroevolutionary time, based on known relationships between body size, cancer risk, extrinsic mortality, metabolic rate, and effective population size. We show that, if mutation rate is sufficiently high and cancer defences are costly, we expect birds to have lower cancer defences than their dinosaurian ancestors. However, if the evolution of cancer suppression is mutation limited, due to e.g. pleiotropy, birds may have kept excessive dinosaurian cancer defences, possibly explaining their low cancer risk. Counterintuitively, birds can then be ‘too robust’ for their own good, if excessive cancer suppression requires compromising reproductive rates. Yet, evolutionary innovations such as flight can increase longevity and keep selection for cancer suppression intact in birds, even if flight requires small body size. Retaining dinosaur-level cancer defences can then be adaptive, particularly if the evolution of flight is accompanied by an increase in cancer risk due to metabolic scaling. Overall, our study suggests that studying cancer suppression in birds can reveal alternative mechanisms to those found in mammals, possibly inherited from birds’ dinosaurian ancestors.",

    "abstract": "Tropomyosin is an actin-binding protein (ABP) which protects actin filaments from cofilin-mediated disassembly. Distinct tropomyosin isoforms have long been hypothesized to differentially sort to subcellular actin networks and impart distinct functionalities. Nevertheless, a mechanistic understanding of the interplay between Tpm isoforms and their functional contributions to actin dynamics has been lacking. In this study, we present and characterize mNeonGreen-Tpm fusion proteins that exhibit good functionality in cells as a sole copy, surpassing limitations of existing probes and enabling real-time dynamic tracking of Tpm-actin filamentsin vivo. Using these functional Tpm fusion proteins, we find thatS. cerevisiaeTpm isoforms, Tpm1 and Tpm2, colocalize on actin cables and indiscriminately bind to actin filaments nucleated by either formin isoform- Bnr1 and Bni1in vivo, in contrast to the long-held paradigm of Tpm-formin pairing.We show that cellular Tpm levels regulate endocytosis by affecting balance between linear and branched actin networks in yeast cells. Finally, we discover that Tpm2 can protect and organize functional actin cables in absence of Tpm1. Overall, our work supports a concentration-dependent and formin isoform independent model of Tpm isoform binding to F-actin and demonstrates for the first time, the functional redundancy of the paralog Tpm2 in actin cable maintenance inS. cerevisiae.",

    "abstract": "The small GTPase Rho5 has been shown to be involved in regulating the Baker’s yeast response to stress on the cell wall, high medium osmolarity, and reactive oxygen species. These stress conditions trigger a rapid translocation of Rho5 and its dimeric GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF) to the mitochondrial surface, which was also observed upon glucose starvation. We here show thatrho5deletions affect carbohydrate metabolism both at the transcriptomic and the proteomic level, in addition to cell wall and mitochondrial composition. Epistasis analyses with deletion mutants in components of the three major yeast glucose signaling pathways indicate a primary role of Rho5 upstream of the Ras2 GTPase in cAMP-mediated protein kinase A signaling. Together with determinations of protein kinase A activities, glycogen and trehalose measurements they indicate a stimulation of Ras/cAMP signaling by Rho5.",

    "title": "Diversity and spread of cytoplasmic incompatibility genes among maternally inherited symbionts",
    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic Incompatibility (CI) causes embryonic lethality in arthropods, resulting in a significant reduction in reproductive success. In most cases, this reproductive failure is driven byWolbachiaendosymbionts through theircifA/cifBgene pair, whose products disrupts arthropod DNA replication during embryogenesis. While acifpair has been considered a hallmark ofWolbachia, its presence and functional significance in other bacterial lineages remains poorly investigated. Here, we conducted a comprehensive survey of 762 genomes spanning non-Wolbachiaendosymbionts and their close relatives, revealing that thecifpair is far more widespread than previously recognized. We identifiedcifloci in 8.4% of the surveyed genomes, with a striking incidence of 17.4% in facultative symbionts. BeyondWolbachia,cifpair occurs across eight bacterial genera spanning α-Proteobacteria, γ-Proteobacteria, Mollicutes, and Bacteroidota. Notably,cifpair has been identified in several intracellular pathogens of mammals showing high rate of transovarial transmission in their arthropod hosts, suggesting a potential role ofcifpair and CI in vector-borne disease dynamics. Structural analyses further reveal that the PD(D/E)-XK nucleases and AAA-ATPase-like motifs are consistently conserved acrosscifpairs in all bacterial taxa. Moreover,cifpairs are frequently integrated within diverse mobile genetic elements, from transposons to large intact WO prophages inWolbachiaand RAGEs in Rickettsiaceae. Phylogenetic analyses reveal recent and potentially ongoing horizontal transfers ofcifpair between distantly related bacterial lineages, a process potentially facilitated by mobile genetic elements. Indeed, the PDDEXK2 transposase exhibits a phylogenetic pattern consistent with the co-transmission ofcifgenes, suggesting that it may facilitate horizontal transfers ofcifacross bacterial lineages. Furthermore, the detection of endosymbionts harboringcifpair in arthropod groups whereWolbachiais scarce, such as ticks, suggests that CI may be more widespread than previously known, with significant implications for arthropod symbiosis, reproductive manipulation, and future biocontrol strategies.",

    "title": "Clusters of deep intronic RbFox motifs embedded in large assembly of splicing regulators sequences regulate alternative splicing",
    "abstract": "The RbFox RNA binding proteins regulate alternative splicing of genes governing mammalian development and organ function. They bind to the RNA sequence (U)GCAUG with high affinity but also non-canonical secondary motifs in a concentration dependent manner. However, the hierarchical requirement of RbFox motifs, which are widespread in the genome, is still unclear. Here we show that deep intronic, tightly clustered RbFox1 motifs cooperate and are important regulators of alternative exons splicing. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that (U)GCAUG-clusters are widely present in both mouse and human genes and are embedded in sequences binding the large assembly of splicing regulators (LASR). Integrative data analysis from eCLIP and RNAseq experiments showed a global increase in RNA isoform modulation of genes with Rbfox1 eCLIP-peaks associated with these clusters. Experimentally, by employing recombineering mutagenesis in a bacterial artificial chromosome containing the NTrk2 mouse region subjected to alternative splicing we showed that tightly clustered (U)GCAUG motifs in the middle of 50 Kb introns are necessary for RbFox1 regulation of NTrk2 gene isoforms expression. Moreover, our data raise the possibility that clustered (U)GCAUG-motifs promote the recruitment of RbFox proteins to form a Rbfox/LASR complex required for splicing. Altogether, these data suggest that clustered, distal intronic Rbfox-binding motifs embedded in LASR binding sequences are important determinants of RbFox1 function in the mammalian genome and provide a target for identification of pathogenic mutations.",

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer continues to be a major global threat to women's health, with approximately 660,000 women diagnosed annually, 94% of whom are in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The high disease burden in LMICs is partly due to suboptimal adoption and widespread implementation of effective preventive interventions. This study explored drivers of implementation success and failure for a future single-visit, screen, and treat approach with thermal ablation (SV-SAT + TA), referred to as TIBA in Kenya. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR framework), we conducted in-depth interviews with 34 participants (frontline health workers, health facility managers, and policymakers) between May and August 2022 in Kiambu, Embu, and Murang'a Counties in Kenya. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. We applied deductive and inductive coding for emerging themes. The participants reported the relative advantage of thermal ablation for the single-visit, screen-and-treat approach, emphasizing its lower start-up and maintenance costs and lower complexity compared to cryotherapy. Additionally, participants expressed confidence in their ability to implement TIBA, and a strong commitment from the leadership to support TIBA implementation was reported. These factors were perceived as drivers of successful TIBA implementation. In contrast, barriers, including lack of essential commodities and equipment, shortage of trained providers, staff redeployment, inadequate space, recruitment challenges, and silos within the healthcare system, were identified as drivers of implementation failure. To optimize cervical cancer prevention efforts in LMICs, it is critical to address both systemic and contextual factors through a coordinated, integrated, and system-wide approach that involves all the key stakeholders.",

We performed a descriptive cross-sectional study at two primary healthcare clinics, catering predominantly to low-income families in Karachi. Adults, aged 30 years and above, coming to the two clinics for acute illnesses or for regular follow-up of chronic conditions were recruited. We used convenience sampling to include participants who consented. We excluded pregnant women and individuals presenting with severe acute symptoms. Of the 496 participants, 406 (82%) were women. Cardiometabolic multimorbidity was present in 231 (47%) participants, with diabetes in 297 (60%) and hypertension in 259 (52%) being the most common cardiometabolic conditions. Anxiety, stress, and depression affected 462 (93%), 387 (78%), and 335 (67%) participants, respectively, being higher in women. Only a small percentage of individuals were referred to mental health services (13% at site-1 and 16% at site-2). The study did not find a significant positive association between cardiometabolic multimorbidity and symptoms of common mental disorders. This study highlights the high prevalence of cardiometabolic multimorbidity and symptoms of common mental disorders in a low-income urban population visiting primary care clinics in Pakistan. To better understand the true prevalence of cardiometabolic multimorbidity and its association with mental disorders, future community-based prospective studies with representative population are recommended.",

Despite their importance, knowledge gaps remain regarding the distributions of both the viruses and their rodent hosts in Southern South America, a region characterized by a great complexity of viral genotypes and reservoirs. This review provides an updated overview of orthohantavirus hosts and their associated viral genotypes in Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Through an extensive literature review, we identified 14 rodent species that serve as reservoir hosts for 15 distinct orthohantavirus genotypes. These rodent hosts inhabit a variety of ecosystems, from forests and arid zones to grasslands and wetlands, and even modified or anthropized habitats, demonstrating a wide geographic and ecological range. Our findings highlight the diversity of orthohantaviruses in this region, reflecting their complex evolutionary histories.

The detergent-insoluble TAC is essential for mitochondrial genome segregation during cytokinesis. The TAC assemblesde novoin a directed way from the probasal body towards the kDNA. However, the OM TAC module which is composed of five subunits, has previously been suspected to follow more complicated assembly pathways. Here, we identified four detergent-soluble OM TAC module subcomplexes that we assign to two classes. One class contains an oligomeric TAC40 complex that according to AlphaFold contains 6–8 subunits, as well as two subcomplexes of different sizes comprising TAC40, TAC42, and TAC60. The second class consists of a single complex composed of TAC65 and pATOM36. We show that the two subcomplex classes form independently and accumulate upon impairment of TAC assembly. The expression of an N-terminally truncated TAC60 variant causes the accumulation of the larger TAC40/TAC42/TAC60 complex and blocks completion of OM TAC module assembly. This suggests the following assembly pathway: i) TAC40 oligomerizes, ii) TAC42 and TAC60 bind the TAC40 oligomer forming two discrete larger intermediates, where iii) the larger subcomplex merges with the pATOM36/TAC65 subcomplex subsequently forming the OM TAC module.",

Some intracellular pathogens, such asSalmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium, exploit macrophages as niches for their replication, which requires precise and dynamic modulation of bacterial gene expression in order to resist the hostile intracellular environment. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the global transcriptome ofS.Typhimurium across four stages of infection of primary macrophages. Our results revealed a profound change in early-stage gene expression dominated by pathways linked to metabolic processes required forSalmonellaadaptation to the proinflammatory conditions of the macrophage. We identified the phage shock protein (Psp) system to be highly expressed in intracellularS.Typhimurium, with sustained high expression over the course of infection. We determined that the Psp system is regulated by the virulence-associated two-component system SsrA-SsrB, which coordinates its expression with critical bacterial functions required for immune evasion and intracellular survival. Functional assays demonstrated that the Psp system mediates resistance to host antimicrobial peptides, including cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), which we demonstrate supports bacterial persistence in host tissues and survival within macrophages. Our findings establish the Psp system as a new and critical adaptive mechanism for evading host immune defenses and highlight the utility of temporal transcriptomics in unraveling the genetic strategies employed byS.Typhimurium during macrophage infection.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS), leading to a broad spectrum of physical and cognitive impairments. Myeloid cells within the CNS, including microglia and border-associated macrophages, play a central role in the neuroinflammatory processes associated with MS. Activation of these cells contributes to the local inflammatory response and promotes the recruitment of additional immune cells into the CNS. SLAMF5 is a cell surface receptor that functions as a homophilic adhesion molecule, capable of modulating immune cell activity through both activating and inhibitory signals. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of SLAMF5 in CNS-resident and peripheral myeloid cells using the murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Our findings demonstrate that both total and brain-specific SLAMF5 deficiency in myeloid cells leads to decreased expression of activation and costimulatory molecules, including MHC class II (MHCII) and CD80. This downregulation is mediated, at least in part, through the transcription factor BHLHE40 and its regulation of CD52, resulting in delayed onset and reduced progression of the disease. Furthermore, pharmacological blockade of SLAMF5 in the brain halted disease progression and reduced the expression of myeloid activation markers. In human studies, SLAMF5 blockade in peripheral monocytes from MS patients and in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia reduced the expression of HLA-DR, CD80, and CD52. Together, these results identify SLAMF5 as a key regulator of myeloid cell activation in neuroinflammation and suggest that it may represent a promising therapeutic target for autoimmune disorders such as MS.",

    "abstract": "Despite the success of antiretroviral therapy in suppressing plasma viremia in people living with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), persistent viral RNA expression in tissue reservoirs is observed and can contribute to HIV-1-induced immunopathology and comorbidities. Infection of long-lived innate immune cells, such as tissue-resident macrophages and microglia may contribute to persistent viral RNA production and chronic inflammation. We recently reported that de novo cytoplasmic expression of HIV-1 intron-containing RNA (icRNA) in macrophages and microglia leads to MDA5 and MAVS-dependent innate immune sensing and induction of type I IFN responses, demonstrating that HIV icRNA is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). In this report, we show that cytoplasmic expression of HIV-1 icRNA also induces NLRP1 inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion in macrophages and microglia in an RLR- and endosomal TLR-independent manner. Infection of both macrophages and microglia with either replication-competent or single-cycle HIV-1 induced IL-1β secretion, which was attenuated when cytoplasmic expression of viral icRNA was prevented. While IL-1β secretion was blocked by treatment with caspase-1 inhibitors or knockdown of NLRP1 or caspase-1 expression in HIV-infected macrophages, overexpression of NLRP1 significantly enhanced IL-1β secretion in an HIV-icRNA-dependent manner. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed interaction of HIV-1 icRNA, but not multiply-spliced HIV-1 RNA, with NLRP1, suggesting that HIV-1 icRNA sensing by NLRP1 is sufficient to trigger inflammasome activation. Together, these findings reveal a pathway of NLRP1 inflammasome activation induced by de novo expressed HIV icRNA in HIV-infected myeloid cells.",

    "abstract": "The impacts of and the ability to respond to climate change are closely intertwined with poverty, inequality and inequity. Addressing the underlying development and structural causes of vulnerability must, therefore, go hand in hand with efforts to reduce climate risk and impacts. However, there is relatively little research on how best to achieve this in practice. The growing number of place-based climate change adaptation interventions provide an opportunity for empirical research on how these projects contribute to the livelihood security and climate resilience of vulnerable and marginalised groups. We used a composite framework to guide our research questions and analysis drawing primarily on the notions of specific and generic adaptive capacity, and three dimensions of equity, namely recognitional, procedural and distributional equity. We undertook 37 online interviews with practitioners from adaptation projects in South Africa, Ghana, and Kenya. Interviews covered, firstly, project activities related to reducing climate risk and building livelihoods (providing insights into how projects develop specific and generic adaptive capacity and for whom); and secondly, the processes employed to incorporate local knowledge, values and practices, ensure inclusivity and transparency, and benefit marginalised groups (giving insights into how equity is promoted). Our findings provide evidence to show that, while most projects focussed on actions to reduce climate risk and impacts (specific adaptive capacity), numerous activities also contributed to building generic adaptive capacity, especially where integrated approaches that supported livelihood diversification were employed. Endeavours to reduce inequity were observed across all projects through, for example, targeting marginalised groups, building on local practices and priorities, and being cognisant of the need to be inclusive through ‘gender sensitisation’ workshops, use of participatory methodologies, and ensuring transparent governance processes. Overall, the findings provide a useful foundation and set of learnings to develop further towards more equitable adaptation.",

By analyzing over 800 microseconds of simulated trajectory, we found that despite convergence to identical native conformations across CTF simulations (with varied transcription rates) and FF simulations, they exhibit distinct preferences for the folding pathways defined by the order of base-pair formation. Conformational space analysis shows that CTF biases the folding pathway by adopting more compact conformations than FF.

    "abstract": "Understanding acute infectious disease dynamics at individual and population levels is critical for informing public health preparedness and response. Serological assays, which measure a range of biomarkers relating to humoral immunity, can provide a valuable window into immune responses generated by past infections and vaccinations. However, traditional methods for interpreting serological data, such as binary seropositivity and seroconversion thresholds, often rely on heuristics that fail to account for individual variability in antibody kinetics and timing of infection, potentially leading to biased estimates of infection rates and post-exposure immune responses. To address these limitations, we developedserojump, a novel probabilistic framework and software package that uses individual-level serological data to infer infection status, timing, and subsequent antibody kinetics. We validatedserojumpusing simulated serological data and real-world SARS-CoV-2 datasets from The Gambia. In simulation studies, the model accurately recovered individual infection status, population-level antibody kinetics, and the relationship between biomarkers and immunity against infection, demonstrating robustness under observational noise. Benchmarking against standard serological heuristics in real-world data revealed thatserojumpachieves higher sensitivity in identifying infections, outperforming static threshold-based methods and precision in inferred infection timing. Application ofserojumpto longitudinal SARS-CoV-2 serological data taken during the Delta wave provided additional insights into i) missed infections based on sub-threshold rises in antibody level and ii) antibody responses to multiple biomarkers post-vaccination and infection. Our findings highlight the utility ofserojumpas a pathogen-agnostic, flexible tool for serological inference, enabling deeper insights into infection dynamics, immune responses, and correlates of protection. The open-source framework offers researchers a platform for extracting information from serological datasets, with potential applications across various infectious diseases and study designs.",

    "abstract": "Understanding cerebral circulation is crucial for early diagnosis and patient-oriented therapies for brain conditions. However, blood flow simulations at the organ scale have been limited. This work introduces a framework for modeling extensive vascular networks in the human cerebral cortex and conducting pulsatile blood flow simulations. Using a patient-specific cerebral geometry, we applied a parallelized adaptive constrained constructive optimization algorithm to create a comprehensive pial vascular network in the left hemisphere, starting from the main cerebral arteries. The resulting network included over 75 000, 103 000, and 55 000 vessels for the anterior, middle, and posterior territories, respectively. Pial vessel diameters featured a median [interquartile range, IQR] value of. We integrated the pial vascular network model with the Anatomically-Detailed Arterial Network (ADAN) model to conduct one-dimensional (1D) blood flow simulations under normotensive and hypertensive conditions. Viscoelastic dissipation proved to be a key ingredient in the characterization of the hemodynamic environments in the pial circulation. In the normotensive scenario, mean blood pressure in the pial vessels resulted in a median [IQR] value of. The flow pulsatility index and its corresponding damping factor were effective descriptors of the hypertensive state. The median [IQR] pulsatility index in the normotensive state was, and in hypertension it increased up to, while its corresponding damping factor in the normotensive state was, and in the hypertensive state it was reduced to. We observed large regional pressure gradients in terminal vessels, with pressure levels ranging fromin normotension toin hypertension. Additionally, the pulsatility index at terminal vessels increased with distance from the Circle of Willis in the hypertensive case, contrasting with the decreasing pattern seen in normotension. This approach provides a unique characterization of hemodynamics in the pial vascular network of the human cerebral cortex, paving the way for research into microcirculatory environments, the link between hemodynamics and neural function, and their roles in conditions like stroke and dementia.",

While the roles of individual proteins are well understood, how they combine to regulate actin dynamicsin vivoremains unclear. Recent advances in microscopy have enabled precise, high-throughput measurements of filament lengths over time. However, the absence of a unified theoretical framework has hindered a mechanistic understanding of the multicomponent regulation of actin dynamics. To address this, we propose a general kinetic model that incorporates the combined effects of an arbitrary number of regulatory proteins on actin dynamics. We derive exact closed-form expressions for the moments of (1) the distribution of filament lengths over time and (2) the long-time distribution of changes in filament lengths within a fixed time window. We show that these moments allow us to distinguish between different regulatory mechanisms of multicomponent regulation of actin dynamics. Our theoretical framework provides a powerful tool for interpreting existing data and guiding future experiments.",

    "abstract": "Agent-based models (ABMs) have become essential tools for simulating complex biological, ecological, and social systems where emergent behaviors arise from the interactions among individual agents. Quantifying uncertainty through global sensitivity analysis is crucial for assessing the robustness and reliability of ABM predictions. However, most global sensitivity methods demand substantial computational resources, making them impractical for highly complex models. Here, we introduce SMoRe GloS (SurrogateModeling forRecapitulatingGlobalSensitivity), a novel, computationally efficient method for performing global sensitivity analysis of ABMs. By leveraging explicitly formulated surrogate models, SMoRe GloS allows for comprehensive parameter space exploration and uncertainty quantification without sacrificing accuracy. We demonstrate our method’s flexibility by applying it to two biological ABMs: a simple 2Din vitrocell proliferation model and a complex 3D vascular tumor growth model. Our results show that SMoRe GloS is compatible with simpler methods like the Morris one-at-a-time method, and more computationally intensive variance-based methods like eFAST. SMoRe GloS accurately recovered global sensitivity indices in each case while achieving substantial speedups, completing analyses in minutes. In contrast, direct implementation of eFAST amounted to several days of CPU time for the complex ABM. Remarkably, our method also estimates sensitivities for ABM parameters representing processes not explicitly included in the surrogate model, further enhancing its utility. By making global sensitivity analysis feasible for computationally expensive models, SMoRe GloS opens up new opportunities for uncertainty quantification in complex systems, allowing for more in depth exploration of model behavior, thereby increasing confidence in model predictions.",

    "abstract": "Compartmental infectious disease models are used to calculate disease transmission, estimate underlying rates, forecast future burden, and compare benefits across intervention scenarios. These models aggregate individuals into compartments, often stratified by characteristics to represent groups that might be intervention targets or otherwise of particular concern. Ideally, model calculation could occur at the most demanding resolution for the overall analysis, but this may be infeasible due to availability of computational resources or empirical data. Instead, detailed population age structure might be consolidated into broad categories such as children, working-age adults, and seniors. Researchers must then discretise key epidemic parameters, like the infection-fatality ratio, for these lower resolution groups. After estimating outcomes for those crude groups, follow-on analyses, such as calculating years of life lost (YLLs), may need to distribute or weight those low-resolution outcomes back to the high resolution. The specific calculation for these aggregation and disaggregation steps can substantially influence outcomes. To assist researchers with these tasks, we developedparamix, an R package which simplifies the transformations between high and low resolution. We demonstrate applyingparamixto a common discretisation analysis: using age structured models for health economic calculations comparing YLLs. We compare how estimates vary betweenparamixand several alternatives for an archetypal model, including comparison to a high resolution benchmark. We consistently found thatparamixyielded the most similar estimates to the high-resolution model, for the same computational burden of low-resolution models. In our illustrative analysis, the non-paramixmethods estimated up to twice as many YLLs averted as theparamixapproach, which would likely lead to a similarly large impact on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios used in economic evaluations.",

    "title": "A causal framework for the drivers of animal social network structure",
    "abstract": "A major goal of behavioural ecology is to explain how phenotypic and ecological factors shape the networks of social relationships that animals form with one another. This inferential task is notoriously challenging. The social networks of interest are generally not observed, but must be approximated from behavioural samples. Moreover, these data are highly dependent: the observed network edges correlate with one another, due to biological and sampling processes. Failing to account for the resulting uncertainty and biases can lead to dysfunctional statistical procedures, and thus to incorrect results. Here, we argue that these problems should be understood—and addressed—as problems of causal inference. For this purpose, we introduce a Bayesian causal modelling framework that explicitly defines the links between the target interaction network, its causes, and the data. We illustrate the mechanics of our framework with simulation studies and an empirical example. First, we encode causal effects of individual-, dyad-, and group-level features on social interactions using Directed Acyclic Graphs and Structural Causal Models. These quantities are the objects of inquiry, ourestimands. Second, we developestimatorsfor these effects—namely, Bayesian multilevel extensions of the Social Relations Model. Third, we recover the structural parameters of interest, map statistical estimates to the underlying causal structures, and compute causalestimatesfrom the joint posterior distribution. Throughout the manuscript, we develop models layer by layer, thereby illustrating an iterative workflow for causal inference in social networks. We conclude by summarising this workflow as a set of seven steps, and provide practical recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Many plant cell functions, including cell morphogenesis and anisotropic growth, rely on the self-organisation of cortical microtubules into aligned arrays with the correct orientation. An important ongoing debate is how cell geometry, wall mechanical stresses, and other internal and external cues are integrated to determine the orientation of the cortical array. Here, we demonstrate that microtubule-based nucleation can markedly shift the balance between these often competing directional cues. For this, we developed a novel, more realistic model for microtubule-based nucleation in the simulation platform CorticalSim, which avoids the longstanding inhomogeneity problem stemming from previous, less realistic models for microtubule-based nucleation. We show that microtubule-based nucleation increases the sensitivity of the array to cell geometry, and extends the regime of spontaneous alignment compared to isotropic nucleation. In the case of cylindrical cell shapes, we show that this translates into a strong tendency to align in the transverse direction rather than along the vertical axis, and this is robust against small directional cues favouring the longitudinal direction. Comparing various cylinders and boxes, we show that different nucleation mechanisms result in different preferred array orientations, with the largest differences on cylinders. Our model provides a powerful tool for investigating how plant cells integrate multiple biases to orient their cortical arrays, offering new insights into the biophysical mechanisms underlying cell shape and growth.",

Carotid interventions can be indicated when a patient has greater than 50% stenosis in the carotid ipsilateral to the cerebral infarction, which is designated as the symptomatic carotid. However, there are often significant number of cases where carotid emboli travel contralaterally leading to ambiguity regarding which carotid is symptomatic. We use a patient-specific computational embolus-hemodynamics interaction model developed in prior works to conduct an in silico experiment spanning 30 heart-to-brain arterial models with differing combinations of bilateral severe and mild stenosis degrees. We used these models to study source-to-destination transport of thromboemboli released from left/right carotid disease sites, and cardiogenic sources. Across all cases considered, thromboemboli from left and right carotid sources showed non-zero contralateral transport. We also found that cardiogenic thromboemboli do not have an altered hemisphere distribution or distinct transport preference dependent on stenosis degree, thus potentially making the underlying etiology more cryptic. In patients with carotid stenosis or chronic occlusion ipsilateral to the area affected by stroke, we have demonstrated that the presence of contralateral stenosis can cause emboli that travel across the Circle of Willis (CoW) which can potentially lead to ambiguity when deciding which carotid is truly symptomatic.",

Postoperatively, POD was evaluated with the Delirium Observation Screening (DOS) scale and POE with electroencephalography (EEG). BAMCOG and MoCA showed poor accuracy in predicting POE, with AUROC values of 0.67 and 0.59 respectively, but BAMCOG demonstrated good accuracy for POD prediction (AUROC 0.85) compared with MoCA (AUROC 0.53). Higher BAMCOG scores were significantly associated with reduced POD incidence, with each 10% increase in score lowering the risk by 16%.

    "abstract": "The ability to complete DNA replication as replisomes converge has recently been shown to be a highly-regulated, multi-enzymatic process. Converging forks also are likely to generate unique supercoiled, tangled, or knotted substrates. These structures are typically resolved by one of the four topoisomerases encoded byEscherichia coli. However, identifying cellular substrates and specific function for these essential enzymes which contain overlapping biochemical activities has remained challenging. Here, we show that Topo I and Topo IV are required to allow converging forks to complete chromosome replication. Impaired Topo I function leads to amplifications where forks converge, whereas inactivation of Topo IV prevents forks from converging and produces a dramatic loss of this chromosome region. The results are consistent with previous studies suggesting Topo I suppresses illegitimate initiations in the terminus region by disrupting R- and D-loops and demonstrate a specific requirement for Topo IV acting before replication completes to allow convergent forks to reach their doubling point. We propose that the positive supercoils arising between convergent forks are converted to precatenanes and resolved by Topo IV, when diminishing space may preclude Gyrase from binding and functioning.",

    "abstract": "Chitin is a major component of arthropod extracellular matrices, including the exoskeleton and the midgut peritrophic matrix. It plays a key role in the development, growth and viability of insects. Beyond the biological importance of this aminopolysaccharide, chitin also receives considerable attention for its practical applications in medicine and biotechnology, as it is a superior biopolymer with excellent physicochemical and mechanical properties. Chitin is synthesised and deposited extracellularly by chitin synthases. Most insects encode two types of chitin synthases: type A, which are presumed to be required for exoskeleton formation, and type B, which are thought to produce the peritrophic matrix. However, the factors that contribute to the specificity of each type of chitin synthase remain unclear. Here, we leverage the advantages ofDrosophila melanogasterfor functional manipulations to evaluate the mechanisms of activity and the functional requirements of Kkv (Chitin synthase A) and Chs2 (Chitin synthase B). We first demonstrate that Chs2 is expressed and required in a specific region of the larval proventriculus responsible for producing chitin in the peritrophic matrix. We then assess whether the two chitin synthases can functionally substitute for each other. Additionally, we examine their subcellular localisation in different tissues and their ability to deposit chitin in combination with known auxiliary proteins. Our results indicate that these two different chitin synthases are not functionally interchangeable and that they use distinct cellular and molecular mechanisms to deposit chitin. We suggest that the specificity of insect chitin synthases may underlie the production of chitin polymers with different properties, conferring different physiological activities to the extracellular matrices.",

WGD generates DNA damage due to scaling defects between replication factors and DNA content.

In this study, we explored the role of homologous recombination and Holliday junction resolution in non-physiological polyploidyin vivo. UsingDrosophilagenetics and high-resolution imaging, we identified a key and surprising role for Gen/Gen1 nuclease. Our findings revealed that loss-of-function and overexpression of Gen have opposing effects, delaying or accelerating the proliferation of polyploid cells, respectively. These changes ultimately impact cell proliferation, nuclear asynchrony and mitotic DNA damage levels. Surprisingly, our findings show that this effect is unrelated with the expected Gen’s function in DNA damage repair. Instead, Gen seems to influence polyploid DNA replication rates. This work identifies a novel function for Gen nuclease and provides new insights into the cellular and molecular requirements of non-physiological polyploidy.",

Our study aims to evaluate the role of built environment detection of SARS-CoV-2 for the surveillance of COVID-19 across broad geographies and populations. We conducted a prospective city-wide sampling study to examine the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 on floors and COVID-19 burden. We used non-parametric correlation analyses and linear models to evaluate associations between SARS-CoV-2 signals and COVID-19 outcomes, across multiple locations/populations over time. Sampling sites included schools, libraries, and emergency departments in the capital city of Ottawa, Canada, from October 2022 to March 2023. Floor sampling was performed across spaces, and outcomes were evaluated at aggregate levels. Detection (presence/absence) and quantification (viral load) of SARS-CoV-2 was determined by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction conducted on floor swabs collected weekly at study locations. The main outcomes, and measures of COVID-19 burden, were (1) weekly regional wastewater signal and (2) weekly admitted COVID-19 patient census from hospitals. We collected 1,863 built environment floor samples over the 6-month study period, with an overall swab positivity for SARS-CoV-2 of 45% (95%CI 43%-48%). We found a strong correlation between overall built environmental swab viral load and hospital COVID-19 census (Spearman’sr= 0.64,p= 0.0017), but no correlation between regional wastewater and hospital COVID-19 census (Spearman’sr= -0.15, p = 0.5). We found a strong correlation (Spearman’sr= 0.76,p= 9x10-5) between hospital-specific swab viral copy number and hospital-specific COVID-19 census, which is a likely driver of the overall association between swab load and census. Built environment surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 from hospitals was strongly correlated with hospital burden with improved delineation of hospital COVID-19 cases compared to regional wastewater. These findings support the use of built environment surveillance for quantification of infectious burden amongst institutionalized groups.",

This bidirectional negative relationship between NCDs and depression necessitates an appropriate intervention for addressing depression in those living with NCDs in low resource settings. To assess barriers and facilitators to implementing the Friendship Bench (FB) for depression management as part of NCD care, a convenience sample of 22 participants involved in the development, delivery, or receipt of the FB intervention were recruited for in-depth interviews from two facilities offering the FB. Participants included 12 NCD patients, 8 FB counsellors, and 2 of the original FB developers. Implementation facilitators included an understanding of emotional distress, positive patient-provider relationships, understanding the purpose and benefits of the FB, accessibility of FB, and positive collaborative relationships amongst providers. Major implementation barriers included a lack of mental health literacy among patients, providers, and institutions, a lack of acceptance of the use of mental health interventions, misinterpretations of the scope of practice of the FB counsellor, and limited institutional support for the integration of FB into NCD care. While FB is a promising intervention for addressing depressive symptoms in people with NCDs in Malawi, major implementation barriers may impact its feasibility and acceptability for this patient population. These findings can inform future research on adapting the FB for feasible and acceptable implementation for NCD patients in low resource settings.",

To design health and social provisions to better serve these people’s needs, it is necessary to first characterise the current provision. This study examines the cost element of this provision. This retrospective observational cohort study examined routinely collected healthcare service administrative data from a large UK-based NHS provider of community and hospital-based mental health services. Data were collected from medical records of individuals with complex mental health (CMH) needs aged ≥18 years old who had an inpatient ward stay between February 2000 until August 2021. Predictors of annual inpatient ward and secondary community care stay (residential/supported living/independent) costs were estimated using generalised linear models. Mean (median) annual total healthcare costs for 185 included adults were £106,847 (£109,651), comprising 16.4% from inpatient ward stay costs of £17,512 (£10,723) and 83.6% from secondary community care stay costs of £89,336 (£97,739). Associations varied across care context. Key predictors of inpatient stay cost included age, deprivation, and substance abuse. The primary diagnostic group of schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders (ICD10 codes: F20-F29) was found to be a predictor of greater secondary community care stay costs. Inpatient ward and secondary community care stay costs varied across patient characteristics. Additional research is warranted to further explore predictors identified in this study to prevent, promote, and monitor activities for individuals with differing CMH needs.",

    "title": "The feasibility of a web-based resilience-building program to prevent stress among danish pregnant nulliparous women: A randomised controlled feasibility trial",
    "abstract": "Stress during pregnancy has been found to modify aspects of fetal development, including organ maturation and neurodevelopmental problems, and to increase the risk of preterm birth and lower birth weight. Studies have shown lower stress levels and cortisol release in people with high resilience. To date, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) has evaluated the effect of a resilience-building digital program to prevent and cope with stress in pregnancy. This study assessed the feasibility of conducting a web-based resilience-building RCT among otherwise healthy pregnant women. In total, 124 nulliparous women were included at their first antenatal appointment in gestational weeks 14–20. The women were randomly allocated to the intervention group consisting of a web-based resilience-building program lasting 20 weeks or to a control group receiving usual care. This study evaluated recruitment, attrition, adherence, satisfaction, and compliance rates using questionnaires on adherence and satisfaction and qualitative phone interviews with pregnant women to investigate the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. The adherence rate was 85%. The overall satisfaction with participation in the study was six on an 8-point Likert Scale, ranging from “terrible” to “fantastic”. In the intervention group, 58% had a “good” or “very good” experience with the program, and 62% reported still using knowledge and methods in the program two months postpartum. At follow-up, 57% had completed all four questionnaires. Some women described that using resilience exercises during pregnancy and birth was helpful for their overall well-being. However, some women found receiving email reminders of the exercises stressful. Overall, our feasibility study showed that the intervention was feasible and acceptable. Before conducting a full-scale trial, minor modifications to the program and the delivery can be considered to improve acceptability and response rate. The trial was registered in the clinicaltrials.gov database (ID NCT03854331) on 26/02/2019 and approved by the Danish Data Protection (J.nr. VD-2019-13) and the National Committee on Health Research Ethics - Capital Region (J.nr. H-19000990).",

    "abstract": "Trachoma, caused by repeated ocular infection withChlamydia trachomatis, remains a leading infectious cause of blindness globally, with significant implications for public health. The World Health Organization and partners aim to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem by 2030, targeting specific prevalence thresholds for trachomatous trichiasis (TT) and trachomatous inflammation—follicular (TF). Diagnosis is primarily clinical. Studies have shown discrepancies between prevalence estimates of TF andC. trachomatisinfection. This study, undertaken in Choiseul, Solomon Islands, evaluated TF, evidence of currentC. trachomatisinfection (by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on conjunctival swabs), and evidence of past exposure to that bacterium (using anti-Pgp3 serology on dried blood spots). Among 645 1–9-year-old children, TF prevalence was 17.5% andC. trachomatisprevalence was 8.5%. These findings suggest transmission of sufficient intensity to pose a public health problem. Notably, 59% of children with TF had evidence of neither current nor previousC. trachomatisinfection. Increasing age was associated with TF and evidence of past infection, but not current infection. The community had poor water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions. This study highlights the benefit of integrating laboratory testing for guiding effective trachoma elimination as a public health problem. Although our work was limited by imperfect enrolment of resident children and the logistical challenges of collecting samples in a remote region, we believe our data justify continued public health interventions against trachoma in Choiseul.",

    "title": "Assessing the impact of tungiasis on children’s quality of life in Kenya",
    "abstract": "Tungiasis is a neglected tropical skin disease caused by the sand flea,Tunga penetranswhich penetrates the skin causing considerable pain and itching. In this cross-sectional study we aimed to assess its impact on the quality of life of school children in Kenya. School pupils (198) aged 8–14 years with tungiasis were randomly selected and interviewed using a tungiasis-specific quality of life instrument (TLQI). The caregivers of each infected pupil and 199 randomly selected caregivers of uninfected pupils were interviewed using the proxy KIDscreen52®to assess their child’s general health-related quality of life (HR-QoL). Generalized linear models were used to assess associations between quality-of-life variables, children’s tungiasis status and other covariables. Among infected children, 62.4% had TLQI scores reflecting a moderate to very high impact, with no significant difference between mild and severe cases. Severe cases had a lower proxy-HR-QoL than uninfected pupils (β -21.15, 95% CI -39.63 − -2.68, p = 0.025), but this was not significant in multivariable models. For the first time, this study demonstrated for children whose caregivers were depressed, tungiasis had a higher impact on their quality of life (TLQI adjusted β 0.28, 95% CI 0.08 − 0.49, p = 0.006) and had a lower general HR-QoL (adjusted β -40.34, 95%CI -55.91 − -24.76, p < 0.001). Conversely, if their caregiver showed them affection, tungiasis had a lower impact on their quality of life (TLQI, adjusted β -0.45, 95% CI -0.70 − -0.20, p < 0.001). Further studies are needed to investigate the interaction of tungiasis with parenting styles, the mental health of children and their caregivers and their effect on children’s well-being. However, this evidence indicates programs aiming to control tungiasis should include activities targeting the mental health and parenting style of caregivers.",

    "abstract": "Microsporidia causes opportunistic infections in immunosuppressed individuals. Mammals shed these spores of fungi in feces, urine, or respiratory secretions, which could contaminate water and food, thereby reaching the human body and causing infection. The oral route is the most common route of infection, although experiments have demonstrated that intraperitoneal and intravenous routes may also spread infection. Respiratory tract infection, although considered to be possible, has not been reported to date. The present study, therefore, aimed to demonstrate infection with the microsporidia ofEncephalitozoon cuniculivia the oropharyngeal route as a model for opportunistic pneumonia. The objectives were the study of opportunistic pneumonia in general while also confirming transmission via the respiratory route to expand the understanding of the epidemiology of zoonoses. C57BL mice, both male and female, up to 12 weeks of age, and free of specific pathogens (SPF) were inoculated (Infected group) or not infected (Uninfected group) with 1 × 107spores ofE. cuniculivia the oropharyngeal route. The animals immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide (Cy) were infected (Cy-Infected group) or not infected (Cy-Uninfected group), and then assessed for the influence of immunosuppression on infection. In both groups, animals inoculated with 0.9% saline solution via the oropharyngeal route served as controls (Sham and Cy-Sham groups, respectively). After 14 days of infection, the lungs of all animals were retrieved for histopathological analysis, phenotyping of lung inflammatory cells using flow cytometry, measurement of fungal load using qPCR, and measurement of the serum levels of Th1, Th2, and Th17 cytokines. The results revealed that the infected animals developed interstitial pneumonia characterized by perialveolar inflammatory infiltrative lesions with a predominance of lymphocytes and plasma cells. However, the fungal load and the extent of the inflammatory infiltrate were relatively lower in the Cy-Infected group, with a predominance of the CD8+T lymphocyte population in the lungs compared to Infected group. In the Infected group not treated with Cy, an increase in the population of alveolar macrophages (F4/80+CD11b-SiglecF+) was noted, along with higher fungal load and inflammatory infiltrate in the lungs, indicating a further pronouncedEncephalitozoonpneumonia compared to the immunosuppressed animals. The infected groups presented Th1 cytokine profiles, with the Cy-Infected group exhibiting increased Th17 levels. Collectively, these results demonstrated that oropharyngeal infection promoted pneumonia caused byE. cuniculiin mice treated or not with cyclophosphamide, with greater severity occurring in the non-immunosuppressed mice, thereby establishing this model as a suitable one for interstitial pneumonia via aspiration.",

Mass spectrometry analysis of chIRAP interacting proteins and screening of interacting proteins affecting the function of chIRAP revealed that the deletion of endogenous chicken peroxiredoxin 1 (chPRDX1) significantly reduced the antiviral effect of chIRAP. In order to clarify the functional site of chPRDX1 affecting the antiviral effect of chIRAP, we constructed the point mutants of chPRDX1 based on the results of molecular docking (D79A, T90A, K93A, Q94A, R110A, R123A), and screened the sites affecting the antiviral effects of chIRAP by knockdown of endogenous chPRDX1 combined with the overexpression mutant strategy, the results showed that the mutations in the sites affected the antiviral effects of chIRAP to different degrees, with D79A being the most significant, and the D79A mutation of chPRDX1 reduces the ability of chPRDX1 to regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS). chIRAP may exert antiviral effects by regulating the intracellular ROS balance at the D79 site of chPRDX1. In conclusion, we identified a novel chicken-derived antiviral protein, clarified its antiviral effects and preliminarily explored its mechanism of action, which provides a new tool and option for the prevention and treatment of avian-origin viral diseases, especially avian-origin related zoonotic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus, a large family of positive-sense RNA viruses, are responsible for both mild and severe respiratory illnesses, ranging from the common cold to life-threatening conditions. Despite significant advances in vaccine and antiviral development, the high mutability of human coronaviruses (HCoVs), such as SARS-CoV-2, presents a major challenge in treating these infections. Effective, broad-spectrum antiviral drugs are urgently needed to address both current and future HCoV outbreaks. Here, we conducted high-throughput screening of a natural product library containing 3407 compounds to identify potential antiviral agents against HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E. We identified several natural products with inhibitory effects on HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and the SARS-CoV-2 variants Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (BA.5)in vitrowithout evident cytotoxicity. Among these, dibenzoylmethane (DBM) not only demonstrated broad-spectrum anticoronavirus activityin vitrobut also effectively inhibited HCoV-OC43 replication in a BALB/c mouse model. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that DBM, when administered orally, maintained effective concentrations in the blood over an extended period, suggesting its suitability for oral administration. Mechanistically, DBM was found to regulate caspase-6, a host factor that suppresses interferon signalling and promotes HCoV replication. These findings highlight DBM as a promising candidate for the development of therapeutics targeting HCoVs, offering potential for treating infections by both established and emerging HCoVs.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (Hnf4α), a conserved nuclear receptor central to vertebrate liver development and metabolic regulation, emerges here as a pivotal immune regulator in teleosts against complex infectious threats. While its metabolic roles are well-established, Hnf4α’s function in bacterial infection, viral infection, and bacterial-viral coinfection—major challenges in global aquaculture—remained uncharacterized. This study reveals that teleost Hnf4α acts as a dual-functional immune checkpoint, essential for combatingAeromonas salmonicida, grass carp reovirus (GCRV), and their coinfection. Inin vivozebrafish models,hnf4α-deficient larvae showed profound susceptibility, with survival rates reduced by 13.33–40% during infections, whereas gcHnf4α overexpression enhanced larval survival by 17.78–23.33% in single or coinfection scenarios.In vitroanalyses in CIK cells demonstrated that gcHnf4α restrictsA. salmonicidaproliferation and GCRV replication through activation of a mitochondrial apoptotic program. Mechanistically, gcHnf4α forms a nuclear signaling complex with apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and caspases 3/9, driving a dual-dependent apoptotic pathway: (1) AIF-mediated caspase-independent nuclear apoptotic processes and (2) caspase 3/9-dependent cytoplasmic apoptotic execution. Confocal microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation validated direct interactions between gcHnf4α and these apoptotic effectors. Pharmacological inhibition of caspases 3/9 or AIF silencing abrogated gcHnf4α’s protective effects, while ectopic caspase expression rescued survival deficits inhnf4α-deficient larvae. These findings establish Hnf4α as a conserved molecular nexus linking nuclear receptor signaling to apoptotic immunity, offering a novel strategy for aquacultural disease control. By targeting the AIF-caspase axis, Hnf4α enables efficient pathogen elimination, delineating it as a promising target for developing dual-action immunomodulators.",

An increase in circulating Vδ1cells has long been observed in people with HIV-1, but remains poorly understood. We performed a comprehensive characterization of Vδ1T cells in blood and duodenal intra-epithelial lymphocytes, obtained from endoscopic mucosal biopsies of 15 people with HIV-1 on antiretroviral therapy and 15 HIV-seronegative controls, in a substudy of the ANRS EP61 GALT study (NCT02906137). We deciphered the phenotype, functional profile, single-cell transcriptome and repertoire of Vδ1cells and unraveled their relationships with the possible triggers involved, in particular CMV and microbiota. We also assessed whether Vδ1T cells may play a role in controlling the HIV-1 reservoir. Vδ1T cells were mainly terminally differentiated effectors that clonally expanded in the blood with some trafficking with the gut of people with HIV-1. Most expressed CX3CR1 and displayed a highly cytotoxic profile, but low cytokine production, supported by a transcriptomic shift towards enhanced effector lymphocytes. This expansion was associated with CMV status and markers of occult replication, but also with changes in the duodenal and blood-translocated microbiota. Cytotoxic, but not IFN-γ-producing, Vδ1T cells were negatively associated with cell-associated HIV-1 RNA in both the blood and duodenal compartments. The increase in Vδ1 T cells observed in people with HIV-1 has multiple triggers, particularly CMV and microbiota, and may in turn contribute to the control of the HIV-1 reservoir.",

    "title": "TRIM28 is a target for paramyxovirus V proteins",
    "abstract": "SUMO-modified Tripartite Motif Protein 28 (TRIM28; KAP1) plays a crucial role in repressing endogenous retroelement (ERE) transcription. We previously provided evidence that loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 triggered by influenza A virus (IAV) infection promotes activation of host antiviral immunity via a mechanism involving derepression of EREs and production of immunostimulatory RNAs. While the IAV NS1 protein might limit consequences of such activation via its dsRNA-binding activity, we hypothesized that other human pathogenic viruses could have evolved more direct strategies to counteract this potential ERE-based defense system. Here, we reveal that V proteins from diverse paramyxoviruses, including Measles, Mumps, Parainfluenza, and Nipah/Hendra viruses, can all engage with TRIM28. Notably, the efficiency of engagement varies markedly between virus species, a phenotype that can be linked to specific residues within the C-terminal domain of V proteins. Further mapping showed that V proteins target both the TRIM28 Coiled-Coil domain and the TRIM28 PHD-Bromodomain, which contains the functionally-relevant TRIM28 SUMO-modification sites necessary for ERE repression. In this context, while paramyxovirus infection triggers canonical stress-associated phosphorylation of TRIM28, loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 does not occur, and minimal induction of the TRIM28-dependent ERE RNA, HERVK14C, is observed. Furthermore, pre-infection with Parainfluenza virus type 2, which encodes a V protein that efficiently engages with TRIM28, limits subsequent IAV-triggered loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 and upregulation of HERVK14C RNA. These findings dissect the interplay between paramyxoviruses and TRIM28, providing support for the concept of a TRIM28-regulated ERE-based antiviral defense system by uncovering a potential viral antagonistic measure.",

However, the role of Sec10, the central subunit of the complex, in host defense and viral replication remains unclear. Here, we reported that Sec10 significantly impairs the activation of JAK-STAT signal pathway of type I IFN (IFN-I) response against both DNA- and RNA-viruses, and promotes viral replication, respectively. Mechanistically, Sec10 interacts with E3 ligase STUB1, promotes the interaction of STUB1 and STAT1, and consequently accelerate STUB1-mediated proteasomal degradation of STAT1 via K6-linked polyubiquitination at Lys240 and Lys652, thus weakens STAT1 triggered antiviral immune responses. More importantly, myeloid-specific deletion of Sec10 in mice showed enhanced IFN-I response against viral infection and improved survival of mice. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that Sec10 attenuates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway by targeting STAT1 for proteasomal degradation and identifies a previously unknown function of Sec10 in antiviral innate immunity and viral replication.",

    "title": "Immune signatures of SARS-CoV-2 infection resolution in human lung tissues",
    "abstract": "While human autopsy samples have provided insights into pulmonary immune mechanisms associated with severe viral respiratory diseases, the mechanisms that contribute to a clinically favorable resolution of viral respiratory infections remain unclear due to the lack of proper experimental systems. Using mice co-engrafted with a genetically matched human immune system and fetal lung xenograft (fLX), we mapped the immunological events defining successful resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues. Viral infection is rapidly cleared from fLX following a peak of viral replication, histopathological manifestations of lung disease and loss of AT2 program, as reported in human COVID-19 patients. Infection resolution is associated with the activation of a limited number of hematopoietic subsets, including inflammatory monocytes and CD3-expressing macrophage-like cells, which are highly enriched in viral RNA and dissipate upon infection resolution. Specific human fibroblast and endothelial subsets also elicit robust antiviral and monocyte chemotaxis signatures, respectively. Notably, systemic depletion of human CD4 + cells, but not CD3 + cells, significantly abrogates infection resolution in fLX and induces persistent infection, supporting the dominant role of peripheral CD4 + monocytes over T-cells in the resolution of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our findings unravel a comprehensive picture of the immunological events defining effective resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung tissues, revealing markedly divergent immunological trajectories between resolving and fatal COVID-19 cases.",

    "abstract": "Influenza B viruses (IBVs), though often overshadowed by influenza A viruses (IAVs), remain a significant global public health concern, particularly during seasons when they predominate. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying IBV pathogenicity remain largely unknown. In this study, we identified two amino acid substitutions, PB2-N460S and NP-I163T, from IBV clinical isolates with distinct replication and pathogenicity profiles. Using reverse genetics, we generated recombinant IBV viruses to evaluate the impact of these substitutions.In vitroandin vivoinfections revealed that viral replication and pathogenicity were not significantly affected by either substitution alone but were substantially enhanced when both substitutions occurred together. Lung transcriptomics in mice infected with virus containing PB2-N460S/NP-I163T substitutions showed heightened immune activation. This was characterized by upregulated transcription of antiviral and immune-related genes, contributing to excessive inflammation and severe disease outcomes. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that each substitution independently increased protein expression and strengthened PB2-NP interactions. However, only the combined presence of PB2-N460S and NP-I163T significantly enhanced polymerase activity. Structural modeling indicated that PB2–460 residue is positioned at the PB2-NP interface, while NP-163 site resides distally, suggesting an indirect functional interplay. These findings provide new insights into the molecular determinants of IBV pathogenesis, highlighting the synergistic effect of PB2-N460S and NP-I163T in enhancing viral fitness and worsening disease outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) has emerged as a rising concern in global health in recent years. The role of PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint in acute ZIKV infection remains to be understood. In this study we demonstrated the activation of PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint by ZIKV. mRNA and protein expression of PD-L1 was boosted by ZIKV not only in SF268 and JEG3 cell lines but also in human dendritic cells. PD-1 expression was more abundant on CD8+T cells in ZIKV-infected mice. Elevated PD-L1 expression was also observed in the brain, testis and spleen of ZIKV-infected A129 mice. Blocking PD-L1 effectively inhibited ZIKV infection, reducing viral loads in all tissues. In addition, anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment further increased virus-specific CD8+T cells, KLRG+CD8+T cells, and effector memory CD8+T cells. PD-L1 blockade also induced interferon γ, granzyme B, and interleukin 2 expression in antigen-specific CD8+T cells, consistent with activation of these cells. Mechanistically, the induction of PD-L1 expression might be ascribed to viral NS4B protein and its interaction with GRP78. Our findings suggest that targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway could have antiviral effect against ZIKV.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) exhibits a narrow species tropism, causing robust infections only in humans and experimentally inoculated chimpanzees. While many host factors and restriction factors are known, many more likely remain unknown, which has limited the development of mouse or other small animal models for HCV. One putative restriction factor, the black flying fox orthologue of receptor transporter protein 4 (RTP4), was previously shown to potently inhibit viral genome replication of several ER-replicating RNA viruses. Since the murine but not the human ortholog is a potent inhibitor of HCV, we aimed to analyze the potential role for RTP4 in restricting HCV replication in mice. We demonstrated that mouse RTP4 (mmRTP4) functions as a dominant inhibitor of HCV infection. Via interspecies domain-mapping, we identified the zinc-finger domain (ZFD) of murine RTP4 as essential for inhibiting HCV, consistent with prior work. Introducing mmRTP4 into HCV-infected Huh7 cells profoundly reduced HCV NS5A protein production and virion release, demonstrating that mmRTP4 can also disrupt already established HCV replication complexes. This inhibition of HCV was not driven by induction of interferon-stimulated genes based on bulk RNA-seq, suggesting that mmRTP4 might directly act on HCV replication. Indeed, byin situproximity ligation, we found that mmRTP4 directly associates with the HCV NS5A protein significantly more than human RTP4 during infection. However, disrupting RTP4 expression in mice expressing humanized alleles of CD81 and occludin (OCLN) – the species specific cellular factors mediating HCV uptake – did not increase permissiveness irrespective of the immunocompetence of the mice. Collectively, our work provides detailed insights into the role of RTP4 in contributing to HCV’s narrow host range and will inform downstream development of a more comprehensive small-animal model for this important pathogen.",

    "title": "A dual interaction between RSV NS1 and MED25 ACID domain reshapes antiviral responses",
    "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants, elicits a remarkably weak innate immune response. This is partly due to type I interferon (IFN) antagonism by the non-structural RSV NS1 protein. It was recently suggested that NS1 could modulate host transcription via an interaction with the MED25 subunit of the Mediator complex. Previous work emphasized the role of the NS1 C-terminal helix α3 for recruitment of the MED25 ACID domain, a target of transcription factors (TFs). Here we show that the NS1 α/β core domain binds to MED25 ACID and acts cooperatively with NS1 α3 to achieve nanomolar affinity. The strong interaction is rationalized by the dual NS1 binding site on MED25 ACID predicted by AlphaFold and confirmed by NMR, which overlaps with the two canonical binding interfaces of TF transactivation domains. Single amino acid substitutions in the NS1 α/β domain, notably NS1 E110A, significantly reduced the affinity of NS1 for MED25 ACID, both in vitro and in cellula. These mutations resulted in attenuated replication of recombinant RSV (rRSV-mCherry). They did not significantly upregulate type I or III IFN levels in IFN-competent BEAS-2B cells, contrary to the NS1 α3 deletion. However, in line with attenuated replication, the NS1 E110A mutation enhanced expression of the antiviral interferon-stimulated gene ISG15, and NS1 I54A upregulated ISG15, OAS1A and IFIT1 in IFN-competent cells. In MED25-knockdown cells, rRSV-mCherry replication was further attenuated at a late post-infection timepoint. The difference between WT and NS1 mutant rRSV-mCherry was partially lost, suggesting that the NS1–MED25 ACID complex contributes to controlling antiviral responses at this timepoint. The strong interaction and the extended binding interface between NS1 and MED25 ACID provide evidence for a mechanism, where NS1 blocks access of transcription factors to MED25, and thereby MED25-mediated transcription activation.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of the endosymbiotic bacteriaWolbachiaas an obligate symbiont of. filarial nematodes has led to antibiotic-based treatments for filarial diseases. While lab. and clinical studies have yielded promising results, recent animal studies revealed thatWolbachialevels rebound following treatment with the antibiotic rifampicin. Previous work revealed that a potential source of the bacterial rebound in female worms were dense clusters ofWolbachiain ovarian tissue. The number, size, and density of theseWolbachiaclusters were not diminished despite antibiotic treatment. Here we define the cellular characteristics of theWolbachiaclusters inBrugia pahangi(wBp) and identify drugs that target them. We show that theWolbachiaclusters originate from newly formed sheath cells adjacent to the distal tip cell. The dramatically enlarged volume of aWolbachia-infected sheath cell is strikingly similar to endosymbiont-induced bacteriocytes found in many insect species. Ultrastructural analysis reveals that the clusteredWolbachiapresent within the sheath cells have a distinct morphology from those present within the oocytes, and that the sheath cell membrane appears to have interdigitations with the adjacent oocyte membrane. This includes membrane-based channels that provide a connection betweenWolbachia-infected sheath cells and oocytes. We determined that theWolbachiawithin the sheath cells are either quiescent or replicating at a very low rate. Screens of 11 known antibiotics and other drugs revealed that Fexinidazole, Corallopyronin A and Rapamycin reduced the number ofWolbachiaclusters infecting sheath cells but only Fexinidazole and Corallopyronin A showed a highly significant difference (p < 0.0001) compared to the control group.",

    "abstract": "Early sensory experience can exert lasting perceptual consequences. For example, a brief period of auditory deprivation early in life can lead to persistent spatial hearing deficits. Some forms of hearing loss (i.e., conductive; CHL) can distort acoustical cues needed for spatial hearing, which depend on inputs from both ears. We hypothesize that asymmetric acoustic input during development disrupts auditory circuits that integrate binaural information. Here, we identify prolonged maturation of the binaural auditory brainstem in the guinea pig by tracking auditory evoked potentials across development. Using this age range, we induce a reversible unilateral CHL and ask whether behavioral and neural maturation are disrupted. We find that developmental CHL is associated with alterations in a brainstem readout of binaural function, an effect that was not observed in a separate cohort with adult-onset CHL. Startle-based behavioral measures suggest that Early CHL animals exhibit reduced spatial resolution for high-frequency sound sources. Finally, single-unit recordings of auditory midbrain neurons reveal significantly poorer neural acuity to a sound location cue that largely depends on high-frequency sounds. Thus, these findings show that unilateral deprivation can disrupt developing auditory circuits that integrate binaural information and may give rise to lingering spatial hearing deficits.",

While previous studies have explored cognitive constraints on generating action consideration sets or refining state-action mappings (policy complexity), their interplay remains underexplored. In this work, we present a resource-rational framework for policy compression that integrates both constraints, offering a unified perspective on decision-making under cognitive limitations. Through simulations, we characterize the suboptimality arising from reduced action consideration sets and reveal the complex interaction between policy complexity and action consideration set size in mitigating this suboptimality. We then use such normative insight to explain empirically observed phenomena in option generation, including the preferential sampling of generally valuable options and increased correlation in responses across contexts under cognitive load. We further validate the framework’s predictions through a contextual multi-armed bandit experiment, showing how humans flexibly adapt their action consideration sets and policy complexity to maintain near-optimality in a task-dependent manner. Our study demonstrates the importance of accounting for fine-grained resource constraints in understanding human cognition, and highlights the presence of adaptive metacognitive strategies even in simple tasks.",

    "title": "A history-dependent approach for accurate initial condition estimation in epidemic models",
    "abstract": "Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting complex dynamical systems, ranging from gene regulatory networks to population-level dynamics. However, model predictions are highly sensitive to initial conditions, which are often unknown. In infectious disease models, for instance, the initial number of exposed individuals (E) at the time the model simulation starts is frequently unknown. This initial condition has often been estimated using an unrealistic, history-independent assumption for simplicity: the chance that an exposed individual becomes infectious is the same regardless of the timing of their exposure (i.e., exposure history). Here, we show that this history-independent method can yield serious bias in the estimation of the initial condition. To address this, we developed ahistory-dependentinitial condition estimation method derived from a master equation expressing the time-varying likelihood of becoming infectious during a latent period. Our method consistently outperformed the history-independent method across various scenarios, including those with measurement errors and abrupt shifts in epidemics, for example, due to vaccination. In particular, our method reduced estimation error by 55% compared to the previous method in real-world COVID-19 data from Seoul, Republic of Korea, which includes likely infection dates, allowing us to obtain the true initial condition. This advancement of initial condition estimation enhances the precision of epidemic modeling, ultimately supporting more effective public health policies. We also provide a user-friendly package, Hist-D, to facilitate the use of this history-dependent initial condition estimation method.",

    "abstract": "Simulation of realistic omics data is a key input for benchmarking studies that help users obtain optimal computational pipelines. Omics data involves large numbers of measured features on each sample and these measures are generally correlated with each other. However, simulation too often ignores these correlations, perhaps due to computational and statistical hurdles of doing so. To alleviate this, we describe three approaches for generating omics-scale data with correlated measures which mimic real datasets. These approaches are all based on a Gaussian copula approach with a covariance matrix that decomposes into a diagonal part and a low-rank part. This decomposition allows for extremely efficient simulation, overcoming a hurdle for adoption of past methods. We use these approaches to demonstrate the importance of including correlation in two benchmarking applications. First, we show that variance of results from the popular DESeq2 method increases when dependence is included. Second, we demonstrate that CYCLOPS, a method for inferring circadian time of collection from transcriptomics, improves in performance when given gene-gene dependencies in some circumstances. We provide an R package, dependentsimr, that has efficient implementations of these methods and can generate dependent data with arbitrary marginal distributions, including discrete (binary, ordered categorical, Poisson, negative binomial), continuous (normal), or with an empirical distribution.",

    "abstract": "Regulated protein degradation by Clp proteases is a highly conserved post-translational control mechanism in bacteria. InStaphylococcus aureus, the ClpXP complex targets the peptidoglycan hydrolase Sle1, maintaining a tightly regulated balance between peptidoglycan biosynthesis and hydrolysis, which is required to ensure proper cell splitting without compromising cell integrity. β-lactams antibiotics disturb this balance, leading to their bactericidal effects. The mechanism underlying the specific targeting of Sle1 by the conserved ClpXP complex remains unknown. From a genome-wide screen for determinants of penicillin G susceptibility inS. aureus, we here identify the uncharacterized protein CxaR (forClpXP-associatedautolyticregulator). Growth defects, premature cell splitting, and increased cell lysis were observed in the absence of CxaR. Interestingly, these defects were mitigated by sublethal concentrations of β-lactams. Through sequencingcxaRsuppressor mutants, followed by immunoblotting, we show that thecxaRphenotypes are caused by excessive Sle1 accumulation. Indeed, exposure to β-lactams reduces Sle1 levels, thereby rescuing the cells lacking CxaR. Furthermore,in vivoprotein-protein interaction assays demonstrated that CxaR directly interacts with both ClpXP and Sle1, whereas no direct interaction was detected between Sle1 and ClpX. In line with this, CxaR was found to co-localize with ClpX adjacent to the septum. Taken together, these findings reveal that CxaR is a new regulatory factor controlling staphylococcal cell splitting by acting as an adaptor protein for controlled ClpXP-mediated degradation of Sle1.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are essential regulators of gene expression, yet few comprehensive databases exist for miRNA expression in non-model species, limiting our ability to characterize their roles in gene regulation, development, and disease. Similarly, isomiRs - length and sequence isoforms of canonical miRNAs with potentially altered regulatory targets and functions - have received even less attention in non-model species, including the horse, leaving a critical gap in our understanding of their biological significance. To address these challenges, we developed an open-source, containerized pipeline for identifying and quantifying miRNAs and isomiRs (FARmiR: Framework for Analysis and Refinement of miRNAs), and an associated interactive browser (AIMEE: Animal IsomiR and MiRNA Expression Explorer). AIMEE was developed to make miRNA expression data more accessible and user-friendly, a feature often lacking from other expression atlases. These tools were developed using equine data but can be readily extended to other species. Using these tools, we aggregated 461 small RNA-seq datasets, spanning 61 distinct tissues, integrating data from public repositories, an American Quarter Horse cohort, and the Functional Annotation of ANimal Genome (FAANG) consortium Thoroughbred samples, predicting 5,781 miRNAs and isomiRs. This work represents the largest systematically curated atlas of equine miRNA expression to date, providing a valuable resource that will enhance our understanding of miRNA and isomiR functions in tissue-specific regulation and ultimately improve biomarker discovery, functional genomics, and precision veterinary medicine.",

To investigate how defects in SC formation affect gametogenesis in zebrafish, we analyzed mutations in two genes encoding core SC components:syce2andsycp1. Insyce2mutants, chromosomes exhibit partial synapsis, primarily at sub-telomeric regions, whereassycp1mutant chromosomes display early prophase co-alignment but fail to synapse. Both mutants exhibit reduced efficiency in repairing meiotic DSBs compared to wild type. Despite these defects,syce2andsycp1mutant females are fertile. However,sycp1mutant females produce a higher proportion of malformed progeny, correlating with increased univalent formation. Whilesyce2mutant males are fertile and produce normal offspring,sycp1mutant males are sterile, with spermatocytes that transit prophase I but arrest at metaphase I or II. Additionally,sycp1mutants display a male-biased sex ratio that can be suppressed by extending the developmental window for sex determination, suggesting that the absence of synapsis delays-but does not completely block-meiotic progression. Notably, embryos fromsyce2andsycp1mutant females exhibit widespread somatic mosaic aneuploidy, indicating that impaired meiotic chromosome dynamics can compromise genome stability during early development. In contrast to mouse SC mutants, the zebrafishsyce2andsycp1mutants examined in this study progress through meiotic prophase I with minimal disruption, suggesting a less stringent surveillance mechanism for synapsis errors in zebrafish.",

InEscherichia coli, three peptidoglycan amidases, AmiA, AmiB and AmiC, cleave septal peptidoglycan during cell division. The LytM-domain proteins EnvC, NlpD and ActS activate these amidases either from inside the cell or the outer membrane: EnvC binds to the cytoplasmic membrane-anchored divisome components FtsEX, while NlpD and ActS are outer membrane-anchored lipoproteins. Here we report the identification of a novel periplasmic deacetylase called SddA that removes acetyl groups from denuded peptidoglycan glycan strands, the products of amidases. ThesddAgene is co-expressed with the gene encoding EnvC, linking SddA function to amidase activation. Consistent with this link, the deletion ofsddAalleviates phenotypes associated with lack of amidase activation, while overexpression ofsddAalleviates phenotypes related to a defective Tol-Pal system and causes cell chaining due to reduced septum peptidoglycan cleavage.

    "title": "Reliance on migrant healthcare workers in the United Kingdom: A critical discourse analysis",
    "abstract": "The UK National Health Service (NHS) has relied on Migrant Healthcare workers (M-HCWs) since its inception. These M-HCWs have typically come from Low and Middle-Income countries (LMICs) and particularly, countries that were previously under British colonial rule. Despite this, medical workforce shortages persist in the NHS and there has been a lack of policy consensus about how best to ameliorate it. In June 2021, Baroness Dido Harding made an ultimately unsuccessful pitch to lead the NHS. During this period she made a statement where she expressed an ambition to reduce reliance on M-HCWs that was met with controversy in the general and medical press. This Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) examines the responses published in newspaper, media and journal articles in the month following Baroness Harding’s statement. The dataset includes a variety of opinions about medical migration and M-HCWs and explores how language is connected to power and knowledge constructed and the effects of these discourses. It draws on theoretical approaches derived from the philosopher Michel Foucault and the postcolonial analyst Edward Said. A total of 48 articles were included in the final dataset which highlighted two main strands of discourse. The first strand is dominant and dissents against Baroness Dido Harding herself, her position, and her statement, predominantly on the grounds that it undermines historic and ongoing contributions of M-HCWs to the NHS. The second strand, which is notable in its relative absence, supports the implications of reducing reliance on M-HCWs. We identified a dominant discourse of support for M-HCWs based on their valuable contributions to the NHS. However, the relative absence of the second strand suggests a marginalisation of debate about the reliance on migration pathways which were often founded on colonial roots, the exacerbation of brain-drain from the Global South, and the inequities that this perpetuates.",

    "abstract": "Coinfection of humans with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and non-viral pathogens may worsen the outcome of HBV infection on the liver. This study determined the prevalence ofHeliobacter pylori, Salmonella typhi, Plasmodium falciparum, andToxoplasma gondiiamong Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)-infected persons in the Greater Accra Region (GAR) of Ghana and examined how such co-infections might affect the levels of selected liver function markers (LFM). The design was cross-sectional, involving 120 HBsAg-positive HBV-infected persons. Blood samples were collected.H. pylori, S. typhi, P. falciparum, andT. gondiiwere screened for, from the blood using lateral flow immunochromatographic assays.P. falciparuminfection was further confirmed by blood film microscopy. LFM’s and blood platelets were measured using clinical chemistry and reflective light suppression/silicon photomultiplier techniques respectively. Data were analyzed using SPSS v. 23.0, and GraphPad 7.0.Seventy-five,75(62.5%) of the participants were males, and 51.7% were 21-to-30-years old. Prevalence ofH. pylori, S. typhi, T.gondiiandP. falciparumwere 40.8% (95% CI: 32.5–49.8), 2.5% (95% CI: 0.8–7.1), 19.2% (95% CI: 13.1–27.1), and 2.5% (95% CI: 0.8–7.1) respectively. Levels of Alanine transaminase (ALT) were higher in HBV-H.pylori coinfected persons compared with HBV-only (33.5vs23.5IU,p < 0.001). HBV-infected persons in the GAR have high prevalences ofH. pyloriandT. gondiicoinfections. Some LFM’s were elevated due to such coinfections. Care givers would need to widen their screening, monitoring, and diagnosis of HBV coinfections, beyond examination for malaria parasites, and monitor other possible causes of biochemical derangements among HBV-infected persons.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to high ambient temperatures near the time of delivery has been associated with adverse birth outcomes, but studies examining the impact on immediate newborn health remain limited. We used a time-stratified case-crossover design combined with a distributed lag nonlinear model to evaluate the short-term effects of ambient heat (0–1 day lag) on low 5-minute APGAR score (≤7; sub-categories: 6–7, 3–5, 0–2). Cases of low APGAR score among low-risk births (n= 34,980) in São Paulo state (274 municipalities), 2013–2019, were extracted from Brazil’s Live Birth Information System (Sistema de Informações Sobre Nascidos Vivos). Municipality-level daily mean temperatures were constructed from ERA5-Land reanalysis data and linked with case and control days by date and municipality of delivery. Models were adjusted for relative humidity and stratified by maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, parity, timing of prenatal care initiation, infant sex, municipality-level deprivation, and Köppen climate zone. Overall, exposure to high (95thpercentile: 26.1°C) versus moderate (50thpercentile: 20.9°C) temperature 0–1 days before delivery was associated with 8% higher odds (OR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02-1.14) of low APGAR score (≤7). In stratified analyses, heat-associated risks were elevated among infants born to women with <12 years of schooling (1.10, 1.03-1.17) and/or self-identifying as Brown/Parda(1.10, 1.01-1.20). Associations were primarily driven by same-day (lag 0) exposure and were only observed in newborns with moderately low APGAR scores (6–7). Acute exposure to ambient heat may adversely impact newborns’ immediate health in low-risk live-births, highlighting the need for heat mitigation measures near the time of delivery.",

    "abstract": "Multi-month dispensing of tuberculosis (TB) drugs is an innovative strategy that may reduce frequent clinic visits and travel costs among people with TB (PWTB) in rural areas. To inform a planned trial, we explored the appropriateness, barriers, and facilitators to multi-month dispensing among PWTB and healthcare providers in rural eastern Uganda. We used qualitative methods situated within the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to explore two refill schedules for multi-month dispensing of TB drugs—a four- or five-visit refill schedule. In December 2024, we collected data through interviews with PWTB, their treatment supporters, and healthcare providers at the regional, district, and health facility levels. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. All participants (n = 39; 22 healthcare providers, 12 PWTB, and five treatment supporters) expressed willingness to adopt multi-month dispensing, with a four-visit schedule as the preferred option. Healthcare providers preferred the five-visit schedule for individuals with complex health conditions: severe illness, clinical instability, or bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary TB. Multi-month dispensing was perceived to benefit healthcare providers by reducing workload, improving patient flow, and enhancing patient management. Perceived benefits to PWTB included reduced clinic visits and travel costs, time savings, improved treatment adherence, reduced wait times and TB-related stigma, and increased satisfaction with care. Facilitators included integration with existing treatment models, person-centeredness, community and family support, reliable drug supply, clear operational guidelines, healthcare provider training and readiness, enhanced monitoring and evaluation, clinic accessibility, readiness to utilize multi-month dispensing, and leadership support. Barriers included undefined eligibility criteria, uncertain effects of multi-month dispensing, differing refill schedules for PWTB and HIV, treatment non-adherence due to forgetfulness and medication sharing, and patient disengagement due to insufficient follow-up. Multi-month dispensing is perceived to benefit PWTB and healthcare providers. Further studies to measure the impact on treatment outcomes should leverage facilitators and address barriers to adoption and effectiveness.",

    "title": "Mortality rate and predictors among stroke patients in the public hospitals in Harari region, Eastern Ethiopia",
    "abstract": "Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, yet there is limited information on the mortality rate and its predictors in Eastern Ethiopia. This lack of evidence is particularly significant, as hospitals in the Harari region provide the majority of healthcare services for stroke and chronic diseases. Therefore, our objective is to assess the mortality rate and predictors among stroke patients in the public hospitals in Harari. An institutional-based retrospective follow-up study was conducted among 452 randomly selected stroke patients at public hospitals in the Harari region from July 1, 2019, to June 30, 2024. The incidence of unfavorable treatment outcomes was calculated at 95% CI, and predictors of mortality were determined using Cox regression analyses. Of the 452 patients included, 292 (64.6%) improved, 21 (4.7%) were discharged with complications, 63 (13.9%) died, and 76 (16.8%) were discharged against medical advice. The 60-month follow-up revealed a mortality rate of 7.6 (95% CI: 5.9–9.7) per 1,000 person-months. The mortality risk was higher among stroke patients with hypertension (AHR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.1-3.9), heart failure (AHR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1, 4.9), those with complications (AHR: 4.9, 95% CI: 1.5, 16.3), hospital-acquired infections (AHR: 3.1, 95% CI: 1.5-6.7), aspiration pneumonia (AHR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.4), poor Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores (AHR: 6.9, 95% CI: 2.4-19.9), and moderate impairment in GCS (AHR: 4.7, 95% CI: 1.6-13.3). Conversely, the use of antiplatelet drugs was associated with a reduced mortality risk in stroke patients (AHR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-0.9). The mortality rate of stroke in this study was comparable to that of other studies in Ethiopia. Factors such as hypertension, heart failure, lower GCS, complications, aspiration pneumonia, and hospital-acquired infections increased mortality risks, while antiplatelet drugs reduced them. Therefore, strategies for early screening and follow-up of at-risk patients are essential.",

    "title": "Trauma and resilience in an urban clinic for unhoused young adults: A mixed methods study",
    "abstract": "Unhoused youth and young adults report higher rates of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) compared to the general population. ACEs are linked in a dose-dependent manner to poorer mental and physical health outcomes in adulthood. Resilience, which is the ability to manage stressors and recover from adversity, is a measurable quality with both intrinsic and extrinsic sources that can potentially be used to mitigate the negative effects of ACEs. This study aimed to explore the relationship between ACEs and resilience among unhoused transitional-aged youth (TAY) at an urban medical clinic. Our approach relied on qualitative thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews. The participants included twenty-eight unhoused patients aged 18–27 years attending a free medical clinic. Our main outcome measures focused on perceptions of trauma experienced by unhoused youth, ACEs score, PHQ-9, and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) scores. The number of ACEs in our study population ranged from 6 to 15, with a mean of 9. The most frequently reported adverse childhood events were divorce, verbal abuse, substance use by someone in the household, feeling unloved or “unspecial,” and physical abuse. Resilience scores in our population ranged from 9 to 30, with a mean of 17. Participants with high resilience were more likely to report close relationships, educational goals, connections with mental health professionals, and housing in transitional living programs (TLPs). Moving from research to policy, strategies that promote resilience by identifying intrinsic assets and external resources can be used to develop transformative programs for unhoused youth and young adults. Housing First initiatives are crucial for providing a safe and secure environment that helps youth feel capable of mitigating the impact of adversity on their health outcomes. Housing First initiatives are instrumental to providing a safe and secure environment for youth to feel capable of mitigating the impact of adversity on health outcomes.",

    "title": "Evaluating the Barcelona Music Reward Questionnaire and semantic differential profile scale for adults with major depressive disorder and suicidal ideation",
    "abstract": "Reward processing abnormalities in individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) alter motivation and hedonic responses, with greater impairments in those at risk of suicide. Preferred music is typically perceived as a rewarding and pleasurable experience that can influence motivation and emotion. Given its influential nature, evaluating how individuals with MDD and suicidal thoughts and behaviours respond to music could serve as a novel behavioural marker to indicate suicidality. This study aimed to evaluate reward response to music measured through the Barcelona Music Reward Questionnaire (BMRQ) and a semantic differential profile scale to investigate music reward and self-perception. Data were collected through the CAN-BIND 5 initiative at St. Michael’s Hospital, Toronto. Adults aged 18–68 years participated in this cross-sectional observational study. Participants included individuals with MDD with suicidal ideation and no attempt (SI/NA; n = 19), MDD with suicidal ideation and lifetime attempt (SI/LA; n = 14), MDD with no suicidal ideation and lifetime attempt (NSI/LA; n = 13), and healthy controls (HC; n = 28). Participants completed the BMRQ online within 48-hours of their baseline visit. During the in-person visit, they completed a 29-item semantic differential profile scale before and after listening to a preferred piece of music. BMRQ results showed no significant differences across groups for each factor and for overall scores. A two-way ANOVA with the semantic differential profile scale revealed a significant interaction effect between participant group and time points,F(3, 224) = 4.32,p= .006, η2= 0.05. Post-hoc analysis using Tukey’s HSD test revealed the HC consistently had significantly higher semantic profile scores than all patient groups, both before and after listening to music (allp< .001). Additionally, all patient groups exhibited a significant change in semantic differential profile scores from before to after music listening (allp< .001). These findings highlight that music engagement was experienced similarly across groups and that the BMRQ was not sensitive enough to detect differences. However, the semantic differential profile scale was sensitive enough to capture shifts in self-perception from before to after listening to music, indicating its potential as a behavioural indicator for suicidality.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia,an endosymbiotic bacterium infecting a wide array of invertebrates, has gained attention for its potential in vector control. Its capacity to colonise host populations primarily relies on vertical transmission and reproductive manipulation in arthropods. This endosymbiont is additionally mutualistic in some hosts, across severalWolbachiasupergroups; notably, in nematodes and, as recently demonstrated, in planthoppers and bedbugs, it functions as an essential nutritional symbiont by providing vitamins to its host. Since mosquito larvae require microbe-derived nutrients for development, we investigated whetherWolbachiaalone can support larval development inCulex quinquefasciatusmosquitoes. Our findings reveal thatWolbachiaalone is insufficient to support larval development. Using transient colonisation withEscherichia coli, we developed a protocol to produce adultCulex quinquefasciatusmosquitoes harbouringWolbachiaonly (germ-freeWol+). These results suggest thatE. colican support larval development in this species, which typically thrives in murky water; they also underscore the importance of extracellular microbes in larval growth. Furthermore, whenWolbachiainfection was suppressed in germ-freeWol+larvae using tetracycline treatment, we observed enhanced larval development, suggesting thatWolbachiaacts as a metabolic parasite. In summary, this study opens the way for gnotobiology research inCulex quinquefasciatusand highlights the intricate interactions betweenWolbachiaand other members, which collectively influence mosquito development.",

    "abstract": "Cambodia is endemic for rabies, a fatal zoonotic viral disease transmitted through dog bites. The Institut Pasteur du Cambodge through its Rabies Prevention Center is the main institution in charge of rabies prevention and surveillance in the country. Its main tool for prevention is post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for bite victims. Allocation of specific PEP regimen is done based on the assessment of the severity of the wound and the information collected by IPC doctors from patients regarding the attack’s characteristics and the attacking animal’s health status. Furthermore, a small proportion of patients bring animals for testing, 60% of which were tested positive for rabies. Using the data collected from patient interviews from 2000 to 2016, we used a Bayesian spatio-temporal regression model to identify predictors for two outcomes: i) a patient bringing an animal for testing and ii) an animal testing positive for rabies. The ultimate aim of the analysis was to provide information that could help with allocation of PEP resources. Notably non-owned animals, a large number of bite victims, and unprovoked attacks were all predictive of a positive test. A suspected rabies status assigned by doctor based on animal symptom description was also highly predictive of a rabies test, with 94.6% of tested animals that were assigned as sick being positive for rabies. Furthermore, we identified three Provinces of Cambodia with higher odds of positive tests: Kampong Cham, Kandal and Kampong Thom. This information could help allocate limited PEP resources, though this study showed IPC already a strong protocol to identify patients exposed to a rabies suspect dog.",

Here, we identify cell surface sialic acid (SA) as a critical functional receptor for GCRV. Enzymatic removal of SA markedly impaired viral attachment and infection. Competitive inhibition using SA-binding lectins or soluble SA confirmed that GCRV targets SA moieties on host cells. Genetic knockdown of SA biosynthesis attenuated viral binding and replication, whereas overexpression of SA pathway genes enhanced susceptibility. Surface plasmon resonance demonstrated direct binding between GCRV capsid proteins and soluble SA, and mutational analysis identified key amino acid residues involved. Notably, pretreatment of GCRV with soluble SA significantly improved fish survival and reduced virus-induced immune overactivationin vivo. To assess receptor specificity, parallel experiments usingRana gryliovirus (RGV), a phylogenetically unrelatedranavirus, showed that RGV infection was unaffected by SA-targeted interventions, highlighting the specificity of SA utilization by GCRV. Together, these findings identify SA as a functional and specific receptor for GCRV, offering new insights into virus-host interactions and potential antiviral strategies in aquaculture.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila melanogaster(Drosophila) is one of the most extensively studied animal models we have, with a broad, advanced, and organized research community. Yet,Drosophilahas barely been exploited to understand the underlying mechanisms of mycobacterial infections, which cause some of the deadliest infectious diseases humans are currently battling. Here, we identified mycobacterial genes required for the pathogen’s growth duringDrosophilainfection. UsingMycobacterium marinum(Mmar) to model mycobacterial pathogens, we first validated that an established mycobacterial virulence factor, EccB1 of the ESX-1 Type VII secretion system, is required forMmargrowth within the flies. Subsequently, we identifiedMmarvirulence genes inDrosophilain a high-throughput genome-wide phenotypic manner using transposon insertion sequencing. Of the 181 identified virulence genes, the vast majority (91%) had orthologs in the tuberculosis-causingM. tuberculosis(Mtb), suggesting that the encoded virulence mechanisms may be conserved acrossMmarandMtbspecies. By studying one of the identified genes in more depth, the putative ATP-binding protein ABC transporter encoded bymmar_1660, we found that both theMmargene and itsMtbortholog (rv3041c) were required for virulence in human macrophages as well. We pinpointed the probable virulence mechanism of the genes to their requirements for growth during iron limitation, a condition met by mycobacteria during host infection. Together, our results bring forwardDrosophilaas a promising host model to study and identify mycobacterial virulence factors, providing insights that may transfer toMtbhuman infection.",

    "abstract": "Drug-escape, where a target evolves to escape inhibition from a drug, has the potential to lead to cross-resistance where drugs that are structurally related or share similar binding mechanisms all become less effective. PLpro inhibitors are currently under development and many emerging PLpro inhibitors are derived from GRL0617, a repurposed SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitor with moderate activity against SARS-CoV-2. Two leading derivatives, PF-07957472 and Jun12682, demonstrate low nanomolar activity and display activity in mice. WEHI-P8 is structurally distinct but binds to a similar pocket adjacent to the active site as GRL0617-like compounds. Using deep mutational scanning, we assessed the potential for PLpro to develop resistance to PF-07957472, Jun12682, and WEHI-P8. PF-07957472 and Jun12682 exhibited largely overlapping escape mutations due to their shared scaffold and binding modes, whereas WEHI-P8 resistance mutations were distinct. These findings underscore the importance of developing structurally diverse inhibitors to minimize resistance risks and ensure that viral mutations against one compound do not compromise the efficacy of others.",

    "abstract": "An important aspect of the current extinction crisis is the loss of distinct clades (e.g., genera). A recent study suggested that there is rapidly accelerating extinction of genera (and other higher taxa), indicating a current mass extinction event that endangers human survival. However, that study was based only on land vertebrates, which include only about half of vertebrates and <2% of living species. Here, we examine the recent extinction (last 500 years) of higher taxa across living organisms. We find that 102 genera have gone extinct (90 animals, 12 plants), along with 10 families and two orders. Yet, the majority of these genus-level extinctions were among mammals and birds, as were all extinctions of families and orders. There were very few extinctions among the thousands of genera of ray-finned fishes (n= 4; 0.08%), squamate reptiles (n= 2; 0.17%), and amphibians (n= 1; 0.18%). Documented extinctions were also rare among the thousands of assessed genera of arthropods (n= 11; 0.32%) and plants (n= 12; 0.17%), which together encompass most known species. Most extinct genera were monotypic (~80%), and most were island endemics (76%). Moreover, despite the claim that extinctions of higher taxa are rapidly accelerating, the highest rates of genus-level extinctions occurred more than 100 years ago, and have declined subsequently. Overall, the recent extinctions of higher taxa are not as dire as previously suggested.",

    "title": "SIFa peptidergic neurons orchestrate the internal states and energy balance of maleDrosophila melanogaster",
    "abstract": "Neuropeptide SIFamide (SIFa) neurons inDrosophila melanogasterhave been characterized by their exceptionally elaborate arborization patterns, which extend from the brain into the ventral nerve cord (VNC). SIFa neurons are equipped to receive signals that integrate both internal physiological cues and external environmental stimuli. These signals enable the neurons to regulate energy balance, sleep patterns, metabolic status, and circadian timing. These peptidergic neurons are instrumental in orchestrating the animal’s internal states and refining its behavioral responses, yet the precise molecular underpinnings of this process remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that SIFa neurons coordinate a range of behavioral responses by selectively integrating inputs and outputs in a context-dependent manner. These neurons engage in a feedback loop with sNPF neurons in the VNC, modifying behaviors such as longer mating duration (LMD) and shorter mating duration (SMD). Additionally, SIFa neurons interact with dopamine and glutamate to differentially regulate sleep and mating duration. Activating SIFa neurons leads to reduced mating duration and increased food intake, while deactivating them reduces food intake. Overall, these findings demonstrate the importance of SIFa neurons in absorbing inputs and turning them into behavioral outputs, shedding light on animal’s intricate behavioral orchestration.",

We investigate the role of the neuropeptide SIFa and its receptor SIFaR in regulating two distinct mating duration behaviors in maleDrosophila: Longer-Mating-Duration (LMD) and Shorter-Mating-Duration (SMD). We found that SIFaR expression in specific neurons is required for both LMD and SMD behaviors. Social context and sexual experience lead to synaptic reorganization between SIFa and SIFaR neurons, altering internal states of brain. We revealed that the SIFa-SIFaR/Crz-CrzR neuropeptide relay pathway is essential for generating distinct interval timing behaviors, with Crz neurons being responsive to the activity of SIFa neurons. Additionally, CrzR expression in glial cell population is critical for regulating LMD behavior. Our study provides insights into how neuropeptides and their receptors modulate context-dependent behaviors through synaptic plasticity and calcium signaling, with implications for understanding the neural circuitry underlying interval timing and neuropeptidergic system modulation of behavioral adaptations.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial quorum sensing is often mediated by multiple signaling systems that interact with each other. The quorum-sensing systems ofPseudomonas aeruginosa,for example, are considered hierarchical, with thelassystem acting as a master regulator. By experimentally controlling the concentration of auto-inducer signals in a signal deficient strain (PAO1ΔlasIΔrhlI), we show that the two primary quorum-sensing systems—lasandrhl—act reciprocally rather than hierarchically. Just as thelassystem’s 3‑oxo‑C12‑HSL can induce increased expression ofrhlI,therhlsystem’s C4‑HSL increases the expression level oflasI.We develop a mathematical model to quantify relationships both within and between thelasandrhlquorum-sensing systems and the downstream genes they influence. The results show that not only do the systems interact in a reciprocal manner, but they do so asymmetrically, cooperatively, and nonlinearly, with the combination of C4‑HSL and 3‑oxo‑C12‑HSL increasing expression level far more than the sum of their individual effects. We next extend our parameterized mathematical model to generate quantitative predictions on how a QS-controlled effector gene (lasB) responds to changes in wildtype bacterial stationary phase density and find close quantitative agreement with an independent dataset. Finally, we use our parameterized model to assess how changes in multi-signal interactions modulate functional responses to variation in social (population density) and physical (mass transfer) environment and demonstrate that a reciprocal architecture is more responsive to density and more robust to mass transfer than a strict hierarchy.",

    "abstract": "Waterlogging, a type of stagnant flooding, is becoming more prevalent in southwest Bangladesh. It is expected to worsen due to the expansion of shrimp farming and climate change, which will contribute to environmental degradation. However, the impact of waterlogging on health, health service utilisation and household health expenditure remains poorly understood. We conducted a quantitative study between August and September 2022 in Tala, a disaster-prone sub-district in southwest Satkhira. Data were collected from 596 randomly selected households. A total of 1266 adults were surveyed, of whom 768 reported a recent illness. Of these adults, 213 reported seeking formal healthcare for their initial visit. Information about households’ exposure to waterlogging in the past 12 months was also collected. Bivariate analyses were used to test the association between the outcome variables (reporting illness, utilisation of formal healthcare, and out-of-pocket expenditure) and the following other variables: age, gender, education, whether the respondent was the head of the household, type of illness, household wealth index, household size, and experience of waterlogging in the past 12 months. Two probit models were fitted for illness reporting and formal healthcare utilisation. Waterlogging experience was significantly associated with illness reporting [Coef: 0.47; CI 0.14,0.80], p = 0.006). However, it was not significantly associated with healthcare utilisation among the 768 adults who reported any illness [Coef: -0.11; CI -0.51,0.029], p = 0.600). Bivariate analyses of the association between healthcare expenditure and waterlogging revealed no significant association (p = 0.635). Significant associations were found between illness reporting and household wealth (wealthiest/poorest) and age (older/younger). In contrast, gender (male/female) and household size (larger/smaller) were negatively associated with illness reporting. Of the 768 adults who reported illness, a negative association was observed for education (compared to higher education) and a positive association was observed for wealth (average wealthy and poorest) and chronic illness (compared to acute illness). These findings highlight the need to consider the detrimental health impacts of waterlogging when improving Bangladesh’s healthcare system.",

    "abstract": "Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is a critical prognostic factor for patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Previous research has implicated the partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of tumor cells and myofibroblastic cancer-associated fibroblasts (myCAFs) in the LNM process. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted a comprehensive molecular analysis integrating original and publicly available OSCC data from bulk genome and transcriptome, single-cell transcriptome, and spatial transcriptome analyses. We found that myCAFs were quantitatively and functionally activated in LNM-positive samples and spatially colocalized with OSCC cells within the invasive tumor front (ITF), providing a niche that may facilitate LNM. Immunohistochemical validation in 90 ITF samples confirmed significantly higher myCAF density in LNM-positive samples than in LNM-negative samples, and this density remained an independent predictor of LNM when adjusted for pathological grade and the pattern of invasion. In LNM-positive samples, myCAFs provided increased extracellular matrix (ECM) signals, upregulating stemness-related genes such asCD44in OSCC cells. The functional importance of this myCAF-driven ECM-CD44 axis was further supported by our validation analysis of expanded, publicly available spatial transcriptome and experimentalin vitrococulture data. We also extracted a spatially resolved, 23-gene signature from the metastatic ITF where OSCC and myCAFs colocalize. This signature predicted LNM status and poor overall survival in patients with OSCC. Our findings provide novel insight into the molecular myCAF/OSCC crosstalk that facilitates LNM and identify potential prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for patients with OSCC.",

While numerous studies have established substantial genetic contribution for LOAD, the interpretation of heritability estimates remains challenging. These challenges are further complicated by the binary nature of LOAD status, where estimation and interpretation require additional considerations. Through a systematic review, we identified LOAD heritability estimates from 6 twin studies and 17 genome-wide association studies, all conducted in populations of European ancestry. We demonstrate that these heritability estimates for LOAD vary considerably. The variation reflects not only differences in study design and methodological approaches but also the underlying study population characteristics. Our findings indicate that commonly cited heritability estimates, often treated as universal values, should be interpreted within specific population contexts and methodological frameworks.",

This age-validated, population-standardised instrument has been shown to have measurement equivalence and lack of bias across South Africa’s 11 official spoken languages. In 2023, South African Sign Language was formally recognised as 12thofficial language of South Africa, but no ELOM (4&5) exists in SASL despite over 6,000 deaf children being born annually. This study reports the methods used to adapt the ELOM (4&5) into SASL and establish its face validity, preliminary results from its pilot implementation with 29 deaf children and initial evaluation of its test-retest reliability and internal consistency. The small sample limits the implications that can be drawn from the results, but we report the sample performing below the Q1 marginal mean for 50–59 months olds established in the national standardisation study on all domains apart from Fine Motor Skills and Visual Motor Integration in the 60–69 months old group where the children are reaching the Q2/3 mean (12.87 ± 0.25). Seventy two percent of the sample scored in the ‘falling far behind’ category in comparison with 28% of children overall in South Africa. Although the ELOM (4&5)-D meets the acceptable test-retest reliability coefficient, it does not do so in all domains with wide variation between the two testing points indicating instability. Internal consistency was found not to be satisfactory. The extent to which these results are a reflection of the children’s true ability, or an artefact of an underpowered sample are discussed with reference to the implications for deaf children of language deprivation in the first three years of life experienced by many deaf children in South Africa.",

    "abstract": "Most low- and middle-income countries face significant public health challenges, exacerbated by the lack of reliable demographic data supporting effective planning and intervention. In such data-scarce settings, statistical models combining geolocated survey data with geospatial datasets enable the estimation of population counts at high spatial resolution in the absence of dependable demographic data sources. This study introduces a Bayesian model jointly estimating building and population counts, combining geolocated survey data and gridded geospatial datasets. The model provides population estimates for the Kasaï-Oriental province, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), at a spatial resolution of approximately one hectare. Posterior estimates are aggregated across health zones and health areas to offer probabilistic insights into their respective populations. The model exhibits a –0.28 bias, 0.47 inaccuracy, and 0.95 imprecision using scaled residuals, with robust 95% credible intervals. The estimated population of Kasaï-Oriental for 2024 is approximately 4.1 million, with a credible range of 3.4 to 4.8 million. Aggregations by health zones and health areas reveal significant variations in population estimates and uncertainty levels, particularly between the provincial capital, Mbuji-Mayi and the rural hinterland. High-resolution Bayesian population estimates allow flexible aggregation across spatial units while providing probabilistic insights into model uncertainty. These estimates offer a unique resource for the public health community working in Kasaï-Oriental, for instance, in support of a better-informed allocation of vaccines to different operational boundaries based on the upper bound of the 95% credible intervals.",

    "abstract": "Youth living with perinatally acquired HIV (APHIV) in India face layered challenges; peer-led differentiated care models show promise but remain underexplored. We examined multi-stakeholder perceptions within the I’mPossible Fellowship, a peer-support DSD intervention addressing APHIV health, education, and livelihoods From May-December 2023, we enrolled three stakeholder groups: (1) intervention deliverers (APHIV “fellows” 18–27 yrs), (2) facilitators (“supervisors” of APHIV), and (3) recipients(APHIV “peers” in care, 8–26 yrs). We conducted interviews with 8 fellows (75% female, mean age 22.5) and 7 supervisors; and three focus group discussions with 18 peers (mean age 16.7). Audio-recorded data were transcribed, translated, and thematically analyzed using deductive coding and triangulation across groups to examine fellows’ roles and program impact. Five key themes emerged, highlighting the layered influences of the I’mPossible Fellowship. First, mentorship provided informational and emotional support for peers; second, peer influence arising from peer-to-peer interactions contributed to a sense of trust and affirmation. Third, fellows’ personal growth stimulated their motivation to fulfil their mentorship roles effectively. Fourth, stigma and poor preparedness for transition into adult care hindered educational, employment and independent living opportunities for APHIV. Fifth, sustainability, through continued mentoring support, was emphasized by supervisors and fellows as crucial for supporting APHIV in transitioning to independent living. This study highlights the pivotal role of fellows and peer mentorships in addressing the multilevel factors that enhance outcomes for APHIV. By providing knowledge and empathy to their peers and serving as credible role models with lived experience of HIV, fellows within the I’mPossible fellowship exemplify a successful DSD model incorporating the three essential attributes of peer support: informational, emotional, and affirmative support. These findings underscore the importance of integrating peer-led interventions into HIV care and reframes youth as active agents of change, recognizing their capacity for meaningful societal contribution.",

    "abstract": "Diversity among college students has increased and, yet experiences of discrimination persist and predict mental health symptoms. The role of various overlapping demographics in predicting discrimination and mental health is understudied. In this study, we examined how gender,race, Latinx ethnicity, and citizenship status relate to experiences of discrimination and mental health outcomes inN= 1665 college students in Texas. Our results indicated that discrimination was endorsed at higher rates by People of Color, Latinxs, women, and non-citizens. Women and non-citizens endorsed the highest mental health symptoms. Multivariate analyses demonstrated greatest vulnerability for discrimination among Latinx women. Regarding mental health, experiences of discrimination associated with stigmatization were associated with deleterious mental health outcomes, particularly for Women of Color. Reflecting the growing scholarship on intersectionality, race and Latinx ethnicity acted with gender to compound risk for discrimination and the effect of discrimination on mental health.",

    "abstract": "Obstetric fistula is a condition where women leak urine or faeces without control due to a hole created between where babies are born through and where urine or feces are stored. Incontinence of urine and feces is one major challenge facing women with obstetric fistula. The study assessed the coping strategies of women with obstetric fistula in the Northern Region of Ghana. The qualitative descriptive phenomenology study recruited 15 women with obstetric fistula through purposive sampling technique. Semi-structured interview guide was used to collect data through face-to-face interviews. The consents of participants were sought, and interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded and analyzed manually using Colaizi’s thematic content analysis method. Using chamber pots as seats or chairs, wearing many clothes, use of rugs, pampers, or sanitary pads, avoiding bulky foods, use of perfumes or detergents, and frequently bathing and washing clothes were found coping strategies of women with obstetrics fistula. Also, control for incontinence, noise during walking and elimination of odor were found as justification for the use of the coping strategies. In addition, parents and siblings, health workers, neighbours and friends were the main source of support for living with incontinence while skin rashes, itching pain, fear, anxiety and grief were the physical and psychological effects of living with incontinence. Coping strategies including use of chamber pots as seats, wearing of many clothes, use of rugs and pampers, avoiding bulky foods, frequent bathing and washing were employed by women with obstetric fistula to manage incontinence of urine and feces. Support of parents, siblings, health workers, neighbours and friends played a significant role in their daily lives. Despite these efforts, women with obstetric fistula experience physical and psychological effects include skin rashes, pain, fear and grief highlighting the adverse impact of obstetric fistula on the general well-being of women.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the incidence of scabies in the Netherlands increased, especially among young adults. Students are particularly at higher risk of scabies infection, as they often live close together and have many contacts. To prevent ongoing transmission and enhance timely treatment, it is important for scabies patients to notify their contacts. We held in-depth semi-structured interviews with Dutch students who experienced scabies in the past year (n = 15). We investigated to what extent they notify their contacts correctly and timely, and what socio-psychological factors influence their contact notification (CN). Thematic analysis was used to analyze verbatim transcripts. The results showed that most participants seemed to correctly notify their contacts, except for casual bedpartners who were often not contacted or not in time. Individual factors that seemed to influence this behavior were knowledge and awareness regarding CN, perceived risk of transmission, attitude towards CN, emotions involved with CN, quality of relationship with the contact, and intention for CN in the future. Important environmental factors were perceived social norm, received response to notification and disclosure, and experienced stigma. There is a need to develop interventions to enhance CN among students, focusing on knowledge and awareness regarding CN, emotions involved with CN, perceived descriptive norms, and experienced stigma.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondiiinfection induces anxiety in hosts during the chronic stage; however, its role in pre-anxiety-like behaviors during the acute stage remains poorly understood. This study investigates the role of Bradyzoite Formation Deficient 2 (BFD2), a transcription factor essential for tachyzoite-to-bradyzoite differentiation, in inflammation, apoptosis, and behavioral changes during acuteT. gondiiinfection. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, we generated aBfd2knockout strain (ME49∆bfd2) and observed reduced parasite proliferation and plaque formation, indicating BFD2’s role in promotingT. gondiisurvival. RNA sequencing analysis of infected BV2 cells revealed thatBfd2deletion significantly downregulated inflammatory responses, with reduced expression of key inflammatory markers (interleukin 1 beta ((IL-1β), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)) during acute infection. Next, we used western blotting, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to verify that BFD2 improves the inflammation induced by acute stageT. gondiiinfection.In vivostudies confirmed that BFD2 exacerbates brain inflammation and neuronal apoptosis specifically during the acute stage, with no significant effects during the chronic stage. Behavior was assessed using the elevated plus maze test and open field test. Compared with the uninfected group and ME49∆bfd2group, the ME49 group mice showed an increased percentage of distance in the open arms and time in the open arm. The results showed that the total distance traveled, distance in the center, and time in the center were significantly decreased in the ME49 group, and the total distance traveled (mm) had no significant changes in the ME49∆bfd2. These demonstrated that BFD2 contributes to pre-anxiety-like behaviors in mice during acute stageT. gondiiinfection. These findings highlight BFD2 as a critical regulator of acute-stage inflammation, neuronal damage, and behavioral alterations, providing insights to develop targeted interventions againstT. gondiiinfection.",

    "abstract": "Although an increased expression of the transcription factor v-maf avian musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog B (MAFB) has been reported in patients with active tuberculosis (TB), its potential role inMycobacterium tuberculosisinfection remains unknown. Herein, we report that MafB in macrophages is a regulator of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-α and IL-12p40, which are crucial for host defense againstM. tuberculosisinfection. Cell-based luciferase assays showed that MafB inhibited TNF-α and IL-12p40 transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner. At the molecular level, MafB interacted with IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-5 and PU.1 and inhibited IRF-5- and PU.1-mediated transactivation, via the basic-leucine zipper domain. Analysis using gene-deficient macrophages demonstrated that the suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine production duringM. tuberculosisinfection depends on MafB expression. Finally,in vivostudies indicated thatM. tuberculosis-mediated increase of MafB expression was responsible for the exacerbation ofM. tuberculosisinfection. Thus, our results provide a functional view of MafB as a cytokine regulator as well as novel insights into host factors involved in TB susceptibility.",

Formate, an SCFA found in the ileum, enhances STM invasion, but the role of the intracellular formate pool in STM pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Deletion of thepflBgene, which encodes pyruvate-formate lyase, depletes this intracellular pool, leading to reduced flagellation and increased expression of pathogenicity island-1 genes (hilAandprgH). This response is driven by elevated intracellular pH and membrane damage, triggering a shift from adhesion to invasion. This transition is regulated by the membrane-bound extra cytoplasmic sigma factor RpoE via the CsrA/csrBpathway. Replenishing the intracellular formate pool enabled STM ΔpflBto use formate as a signalling molecule to modulate virulence. Our findings underscore the critical role of intracellular formate in maintaining pH balance and coordinating the regulation of flagellar and SPI-1 genes, emphasizing the need to fine-tunepflBexpression across intestinal regions for optimal STM invasion.",

The periplasmic ligand-binding domain of CqsR is a Cache domain, the most prevalent extracellular sensory module in prokaryotes. Our findings provide a rare structural comparison of ligand-bound and unbound states of a Cache domain receptor. Coupled with thermodynamic binding assays and genetic analyses, these structures elucidate the molecular basis of CqsR ligand specificity. This study not only advances the understanding of Cache domain function but also informs the identification of ligands for orphan Cache receptors and the rational design of signaling agonists and antagonists.

In this study, using an infection-based in-vitro infection model system combined with advanced dynamical imaging, we present the first molecular details of uropathogenicE. coli(UPEC) dividing to form and proliferate as coccoid-shaped cells inside human host cells. For these intracellular UPEC cells, the frequency of cell division outpaced the rate of cell growth, resulting in a morphological transition from traditional rod-shape to coccobacilli. We also visualized the subcellular protein dynamics in these cells and noted that the division proteins follow the similar localization and constriction patterns that have been demonstrated for vegetative growth. However, unlike for fast-growing rod-shaped cells, FtsZ constriction in intracellular UPEC occurs prior to visual nucleoid segregation. Our results suggest that the modulation of division rate contributes to morphological adaptability of intracellular UPEC at the single-cell level.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical accounts postulate that the catecholaminergic neuromodulator noradrenaline shapes cognition and behavior by reducing the impact of prior expectations on learning, inference, and decision-making. A ubiquitous effect of dynamic priors on perceptual decisions under uncertainty is choice history bias: the tendency to systematically repeat, or alternate, previous choices, even when stimulus categories are presented in a random sequence. Here, we directly test for a causal impact of catecholamines on these priors. We pharmacologically elevated catecholamine levels in human participants through the application of the noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine. We quantified the resulting changes in observers’ history biases in a visual perceptual decision task. Choice history biases in this task were highly idiosyncratic, tending toward choice repetition or alternation in different individuals. Atomoxetine decreased these biases (toward either repetition or alternation) compared to placebo. Behavioral modeling indicates that this bias reduction was due to a reduced bias in the accumulation of sensory evidence, rather than of the starting point of the accumulation process. Atomoxetine had no significant effect on other behavioral measures tested, including response time and choice accuracy. Atomoxetine and variations of pupil-linked arousal at slower and faster timescales had analogous effects on choice history bias. We conclude that catecholamines reduce the impact of a specific form of prior on perceptual decisions.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the neural mechanisms behind short-term memory (STM) errors is crucial for unraveling cognitive processes and addressing deficits associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. This study examines whether STM errors arise from misrepresentation of sensory information or decay in these representations over time. Using 2-photon calcium imaging in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of mice performing a delayed match-to-sample task, we identified a subset of PPC neurons exhibiting both directional and temporal selectivity. Contrary to the hypothesis that STM errors primarily stem from mis-encoding during the sample phase, our findings reveal that these errors are more strongly associated with a drift in neural activity during the delay period. This drift leads to a gradual divergence away from the correct representation, ultimately leading to incorrect behavioral responses. These results emphasize the importance of maintaining stable neural representations in the PPC for accurate STM. Furthermore, they highlight the potential for therapeutic interventions aimed at stabilizing PPC activity during delay periods as a strategy for mitigating cognitive impairments in conditions like schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Agent-based models can be applied to infer the effects of climate change on complex ecological systems such as addressing the behaviour of the vector-host system under temperature change and assess its effects on vector activity and density. Ticks are important vectors of pathogens that cause the spread of many tick-borne diseases. The tick population dynamics depend on several biotic and abiotic factors, such as temperature and host density. Such complexity of dependence and non-linear interactions makes it challenging to predict the dynamics and density of ticks under a changing climate. The objective of this study is to evaluate the reconstructed temperature signals using an agent-based model, where we only consider temperature to be the limiting abiotic factor influencing the development of ticks to infer patterns of tick population dynamics. We parametrized the model using the blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis data and we simulated tick population dynamics for ten years in five scenarios in which we modified the input temperature signals. We found that tick responses to changing spring-autumn and constant trends vary considerably. Higher interseason duration leads to more stable but lower overall populations, whereas, conversely, very low interseason duration results in substantial population growth. Extending the duration of the warm season led to a population explosion, while an increase in the cold season resulted in a low population abundance and decreasing trends. These results highlight the importance of season duration variability and potential non-linearity in the tick population’s response to environmental change.",

Reporting delays and infection under-ascertainment, which characterise practical surveillance data, can misinform decision-making, prompting mistimed NPIs that fail to control spread or permitting deleterious epidemic peaks that overload healthcare capacities. To mitigate these risks, recent studies propose more data-insensitive strategies that trigger NPIs at predetermined times or infection thresholds. However, these strategies often increase NPI durations, amplifying their substantial costs to livelihood and life-quality. We develop a novel model-predictive control algorithm that optimises NPI decisions. We jointly minimise the cumulative risks and costs of interventions of different stringency over stochastic epidemic projections. Our algorithm is among the earliest to realistically incorporate uncertainties underlying both the generation and surveillance of infections. We find, except under extremely delayed reporting, that our projective approach outperforms data-insensitive strategies and show that earlier decisions strikingly improve real-time control with reduced NPI costs. Moreover, we expose how surveillance quality, disease growth and NPI frequency intrinsically limit our ability to flatten epidemic peaks or dampen endemic oscillations and reveal why this potentially makes Ebola virus more controllable than SARS-CoV-2. Our algorithm provides a general framework for guiding optimal NPI decisions ahead-of-time and identifying the key factors limiting practical epidemic control.",

    "title": "Molecular dynamics study of differential effects of serotonin-2A-receptor (5-HT2AR) modulators",
    "abstract": "The serotonin-2A receptor (5-HT2AR) is an interesting target for drug design in the context of antidepressants that might have a rapid onset of action and/or be effective in treatment-resistant cases. The main challenge, however, is that the activation of this receptor can provoke hallucinations. Recent studies have shown that activating the receptor with certain (partial) agonists could potentially give rise to antidepressant effect without hallucinogenic side effects. Although substantial research has been done in this area, the atomistic details of this differential activation of the serotonin-2A receptor are not fully understood. In the present study we performed multiple atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on 5-HT2AR bound with two antipsychotics, three different potential non-hallucinogens and two hallucinogens to identify the receptor’s ligand dependent conformations. Overall, our findings suggest that modest 5-HT2AR activation would only yield antidepressant effects and hallucinations result from excessive activation. While modest activation through microdosing may be problematic on account of abuse potential as well as possibly narrow and patient-dependent therapeutic windows, modest activation through administration of a sufficiently weak partial agonist may offer a viable drug development pathway.",

    "abstract": "Accurate preferred language data is a prerequisite for providing high-quality care. We investigated the accuracy of preferred language data in the electronic health record (EHR) of a large community hospital network in Toronto, Canada. We conducted a point-prevalence audit of patients admitted to intensive care, internal medicine, and nephrology services at three hospitals. We asked each patient “What is your preferred language for health care communication?” and reported on agreement (with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) between interview-based and EHR-based preferred language. We used Bayesian multilevel logistic regression to analyze the association between patient factors and the accuracy of the EHR for patients who preferred a non-English language. Between June 17, 2024, and July 19, 2024, we interviewed 323 patients, of whom 124 (38%) preferred a non-English language. Median age was 77 years and 46% were female. EHR accuracy was 86% for all patients. The probability of the EHR correctly identifying a patient with non-English preferred language (sensitivity) was 69% (CI 60–77), specificity was 97% (CI 94–99), positive predictive value was 95% (CI 88–98), and negative predictive value was 83% (CI 79–87). There were 26 different non-English preferred languages, most commonly Cantonese (27%) and Tamil (14%). Accuracy was better for patients who were female or older, and varied by hospital and medical service. Mechanisms to improve accuracy for language preference data are needed to improve the validity of research studying preferred language, mitigate algorithmic bias, and overcome language-based inequities.",

    "title": "Diabetes Mellitus screening and associated factors in Peru: A cross-sectional analysis of a national health survey",
    "abstract": "Screening rates for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Peru remain low despite an increasing prevalence of the disease. In 2022, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended screening adults aged 18–34 with overweight or obesity and at least one risk factor, including Latino ethnicity and lowered the universal screening age to 35 years. This study aimed to determine the T2DM screening prevalence in Peru and the factors associated with lack of screening in the population that meets ADA screening criteria. A cross-sectional, secondary data analysis was conducted based on the 2022 Peruvian Demographic and Health Survey database. Screening was defined as apparently healthy individuals having their blood glucose measured in the last year. Participants aged 18–34 years with overweight or obesity, as well as all participants aged ≥ 35 years, were included. Bivariate analysis was performed using the chi-squared test, and multivariate Poisson regression was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs), adjusting for potential confounders. Of 26,166 individuals who met inclusion criteria, 25.3% were screened for T2DM. The factors most strongly associated with lack of screening were: age 18–34 years (aPR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.05-1.11), having only elementary education (aPR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.13-1.23), not having health insurance (aPR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.12-1.18), belonging to the lowest wealth quintile (aPR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.05-1.13), and daily smoking (aPR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.01-1.19). The national rate of screening for T2DM in Peru is low (25.3%). There is a higher prevalence for a lack of screening in people who: are younger, have only primary education, do not have health insurance, belong to the lowest wealth quintile, and are smokers. Targeted interventions are needed to improve screening coverage in these high-risk populations.",

    "abstract": "Community Health Workers (CHWs) play a crucial role to support health care delivery in underserved communities. Although the value of CHWs’ contributions is widely recognised, there is limited evidence on the mechanisms that enable CHWs to deliver people-centred care. Using a realist evaluation approach guided by WHO’s Integrated People-Centred Health Services (IPCHS) framework, the study focused on how different contexts and mechanisms interact to align with the IPCHS strategies to shape CHWs’ capacity to deliver people-centred care. This realist qualitative study was conducted in five rural communities in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Data was collected through structured observations of CHWs’ interactions with households; interviews with CHWs, service users, household decision makers, outreach team leaders (CHWs’ supervisors), and clinic operational managers. Data was further corroborated through three focus group discussions with CHWs. Using thematic analysis and realist evaluation methods, we identified Context-Mechanism-Outcome (CMO) configurations influencing CHWs’ delivery of people-centred care, followed by refinement of the programme theory and development of middle-range theories. The study identified meta-mechanisms (trust, legitimacy, and motivation) that operate across all domains of the IPCHS framework and underpin the ability of CHWs to engage communities, coordinate care, and deliver integrated, people-centred services. These meta-mechanisms are triggered within enabling conditions, notably formalized supervision, CHW integration into the formal health system, and intersectoral collaboration. However, governance gaps such as precarious employment, inadequate remuneration, poor resourcing, lack of data feedback loops, and insufficient institutional recognition of CHWs’ intersectoral role undermines these interactions, resulting in the poor delivery of IPCHS. The study contributes to policy discussions by providing middle-range theories that explain how, why, and when CHW-led people-centred interventions fail or succeed. Critical findings include the need for a dynamic Integrated, Mechanism-Sensitive Model of the IPCHS and governance reforms that include structured workforce integration for adequate resourcing and intersectoral action.",

    "abstract": "Intimate partner violence (IPV) is associated with suboptimal HIV treatment behaviors and health outcomes among perinatal women. Less is known about the postpartum phase or how distinct types of perinatal IPV exposure may inhibit HIV-related care. We conducted a qualitative study nested within an ongoing trial among perinatal women in rural Kenya to explore the influence of IPV on adherence to HIV treatment during pregnancy and postpartum. In 2022, a trained researcher fluent in Dholuo and Kiswahili conducted 23 semi-structured interviews with women up to 2 years postpartum living with HIV and self-reported IPV in their current relationship. Digitally recorded interviews were translated into English, transcribed verbatim, and thematically coded using deductive and inductive techniques. Nearly all women reported psychological and financial IPV, the majority reported physical IPV, half reported male controlling behaviors, half reported reproductive coercion, and many reported sexual IPV. Many women described a link between IPV and their adherence to perinatal HIV care and treatment. An indirect pathway was exhibited when psychological IPV heightened mental distress, leading to non-adherence through symptoms of depression and anxiety. A second path occurred when financial IPV and withholding food led to HIV treatment challenges. A direct pathway occurred when male partners sabotaged HIV treatment or controlled women’s access to HIV care. In turn, women’s evasion of IPV through leaving home or strategic non-disclosure had unanticipated consequences for their HIV treatment. Despite enduring IPV, many women described adhering to HIV treatment to sustain good health for themselves and their children. IPV-exposed women living with HIV described multiple ways a violent relationship was detrimental to maintaining their HIV treatment. To meet global goals to end vertical transmission of HIV and improve maternal and infant health, preventing and addressing IPV within maternal health settings should be prioritized in HIV programming.",

Despite its increased importance in Ghana, no study has been conducted to assess the knowledge and misperceptions of Ghanaian schoolteachers about ADHD. This study thus aimed to evaluate schoolteachers’ level of knowledge and misperceptions about ADHD. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among teachers from eleven primary schools in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana from February to July 2023. A validated and self-administered questionnaire, comprising a demographic questionnaire and the Knowledge of Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (KADDS), was used to collect data on participants’ sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge, and misperceptions about ADHD. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed on the data using SPSS version. 26. Statistical significance was set at p = 0.05. The study included 170 participants, the majority being female (62.4%). The average percentage of knowledge regarding ADHD general knowledge, symptoms/diagnosis, and treatment was 32.29%, 40.92%, and 31.32%, respectively. The overall proportion of correct, incorrect, and “do not know” responses was 34.90%, 23.40%, and 41.70%, respectively. Common misconceptions included the belief that children with ADHD often outgrow the condition and that reducing dietary sugar alleviates symptoms. Educational background (p = 0.037), prior ADHD training (p = 0.005), and experience teaching an ADHD child (p = 0.003) were significantly associated with higher knowledge scores.

    "abstract": "This study presents the first UK Biobank analysis to concurrently model subjective wellbeing and illbeing within a unified biopsychosocial framework, offering a novel, data-rich perspective on psychological functioning in later life. While wellbeing and illbeing are often studied in isolation, there is growing recognition that their determinants may differ in kind and form. We address this gap by examining how biological, psychological, and social factors dynamically shape both outcomes in a large community-dwelling sample. Drawing on data from 8,047 participants (mean age = 64.8 years; 46.7% male; 90.7% White British), we constructed a theory-informed partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) linking heart rate variability (HRV), meaning-oriented behaviour (MOB), resilience, social connectedness, and lifetime adversity to wellbeing and illbeing. Model robustness was supported through 10,000-sample bootstrapping and split-half replication. Network centrality analysis (NCA) was used to identify key drivers, and Bayesian regression was applied to test non-linear functional forms for each path, validated using a held-out test dataset. MOB emerged as the strongest direct predictor of both increased wellbeing and reduced illbeing. HRV influenced wellbeing indirectly via psychosocial mediators. Adversity had the largest total effect on illbeing but no direct effect on wellbeing. Together, predictors accounted for ~52% of variance in both outcomes. Bayesian models revealed exponential, cubic, and logarithmic forms, indicating that conditions optimising wellbeing are not merely the inverse of those reducing illbeing. These findings offer a detailed mapping of non-linear biopsychosocial pathways in older adults and challenge the assumption that wellbeing and illbeing lie on a single continuum. The study provides a robust empirical foundation for developing process-based, context-sensitive mental health interventions. Longitudinal and more demographically diverse studies are now needed to test causal directions and broader generalisability.",

    "abstract": "In areas of high infection prevalence, effective control of schistosomiasis – one of the most important Neglected Tropical Diseases – requires supplementing medical treatment with interventions targeted at the environmental reservoir of disease. In addition to provision of clean water, reliable sanitation, and molluscicide use to control the obligate intermediate host snail, top-down biological control of parasite-competent snails has recently gained increasing interest in the scientific community. However, evidence that natural predators can effectively reduce snail abundance and, ultimately, transmission risk to vulnerable human populations remains limited. In this study, we used a Before-After-Control-Intervention (BACI) design implemented in seven lakeside areas, including three intervention areas and four control areas, on the southern shores of Lake Victoria (Tanzania) in 2019–2023. We tested whether the restoration of African catfish,Clarias gariepinus, a native species of commercial value, could reduce both the abundance ofBiomphalariasnails (intermediate hosts ofSchistosoma mansoni) and infection intensity in school age children (SAC). Where catfish were restored, mean site-level snail counts declined by 57% (95% CI: 29.4%, 74.3%). At primary schools located within each area, SAC infection intensity (mean parasite egg count in stool samples) also decreased significantly by 55% (95% CI: 26%, 73%). This study shows that natural predators of host snails have the potential for schistosomiasis control. Scaling up to a lake-wide approach will require systemic intervention, with snail host control contributing to a broader framework for schistosomiasis management.",

    "abstract": "Direct morbidity assessments are rarely included in monitoring and evaluation ofSchistosoma mansonimass drug administration programmes. This is despite morbidity reduction being the leading objective of control and elimination as a public health problem in the World Health Organization (WHO) targets. Instead, the number of eggs-per-gram (EPG) of faeces are used as a morbidity proxy. Furthermore, current WHO guidelines use infection intensity thresholds to determine where and when MDA is to be implemented. However, recent work has begun to question this assumption of a direct association between infection intensity in intestinal schistosomiasis and host morbidity. Here we aimed to examine the potential association betweenS. mansoniinfection intensity and morbidity from pre-school-aged children (PSAC) through to elderly individuals, living in Bugoto, Uganda. Prevalence and intensities ofS. mansoniinfection were diagnosed by Kato-Katz and point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen tests (POC-CCAs) in 287 individuals aged 3–74 years, from Bugoto, Uganda. In addition to data on anaemia and self-reported symptoms, abdominal ultrasound examinations were conducted to identify liver parenchyma image pattern (IP), portal vein dilation (PVD) and left parasternal line (PSL) enlargement. Malaria status was determined using rapid diagnostic testing. Generalised additive models estimated associations between morbidity outcomes and infection intensity/presence, diagnostic method, co-infections, age and sex. The prevalence of positive IP scores, dilated PVD, enlarged PSL and anaemia were 9%, 34%, 33% and 13% respectively. NeitherS. mansoniinfection intensity or status were significantly associated with PVD, PSL, or anaemia. Age was the most consistent predictor of morbidity, with the highest burden of PVD, PSL and anaemia in PSAC. Malaria infection was also positively associated with PVD and anaemia. A positive POC-CCA predicted only self-reported blood in stool. Our findings add to growing evidence that current infection intensity is an inappropriate proxy for schistosomiasis morbidity, urging a revaluation of tools and targets. The observed prevalence of morbidities in PSAC evidence a need to elucidate the impact of less-specific morbidities, pastS. mansoniand other parasitic infections on host health, and adds urgency to the on-going roll out of treatment to this age group.",

In this study, we identify the PP2A-2 holoenzyme as a key regulator of daughter cell emergence during parasite division. This holoenzyme, likely composed of the regulatory subunit TgPR48 (PP2A-B2), the catalytic subunit PP2A-C2, and the scaffolding subunit PP2A-A2, is essential for proper cytokinesis. Disruption of any single component severely impairs daughter cell separation and emergence. Phosphoproteomic analysis following PP2A-C2 depletion revealed numerous differentially phosphorylated proteins. Among these, DCS1 and DCS2 were prioritized as potential effectors. While phosphomimetic and non-phosphorylatable mutations in DCS1 and DCS2 did not significantly impair their function, depletion of either protein disrupted TgPR48 localization. Interestingly, TgPR48 overexpression partially rescued the phenotypes associated with DCS2 loss, but not DCS1, indicating divergence in their downstream pathways and implicating additional, yet unidentified, substrates. These findings establish PP2A-2–mediated dephosphorylation as a central mechanism in regulating tachyzoite cytokinesis and highlight a promising regulatory axis for therapeutic intervention againstT. gondii.",

Consequently, the quorum-sensing deficient mutant was avirulent in theCaenorhabditis elegansfast killing infection model. An intactrubBgene was essential for the TBCF10839 strain to inactivate hydrogen peroxide and to persist and multiply in human neutrophils. Upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide, the ternary complex of rubredoxin reductase, rubredoxin and catalase initially mediates the direct reduction to water followed by disproportionation into water and oxygen when the NADH pool is depleted.

Although numerous host proviral factors have been identified, the landscape of host restriction factors and their underlying mechanisms remain less explored.

We identified glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis as the pan-coronavirus host factor that restrict viral entry by disrupting spike protein-mediated membrane fusion at both endosomal and plasma membranes. GPI biosynthesis generates GPI moieties that covalently anchor proteins (GPI-anchored proteins [GPI-APs]) to the cell membrane, playing essential roles in various cellular processes. Through focused CRISPR knockout screens targeting 193 GPI-APs, we identified LY6E, a known pan-coronavirus restriction factor for viral entry, as the key downstream effector mediating the antiviral activity of the GPI biosynthesis pathway. These findings reveal the role for GPI biosynthesis as a conserved host defense mechanism against coronaviruses via regulation of downstream effectors.",

    "title": "A close unicellular animal relative and predator of schistosomes exhibits chemokinesis in response to proteins and peptides from its prey",
    "abstract": "Regulated motility is vital for many cells—both for unicellular microbes and for cells within multicellular bodies. Different conditions require different rates and directions of movement. For the microbial predatorCapsaspora owczarzaki, its motility is likely essential for predation. This organism has been shown to prey on diverse organisms, including the schistosome parasites that co-reside with it inBiomphalaria glabratasnails.Capsasporais also one of the closest living unicellular relatives of animals. This phylogenic placement makesCapsaspora’s motility an attractive target for understanding the evolution of motility in animal cells. Until now, little was known of howCapsasporaregulates its rate and direction of motility. Here we found that it exhibits chemokinesis (increased movement in response to chemical factors) in response to proteins released from prey cells. Chemokinesis also occurs in response to pure proteins—including bovine serum albumin. We found that this chemokinesis behavior is dependent onCapsasporacell density, which suggests that the regulated motility is a cooperative behavior (possibly to improve cooperative feeding). We developed a mathematical model ofCapsasporamotility and found that chemokinesis can benefitCapsasporapredation. In this model,Capsasporamoved in random trajectories. Chemotaxis (directional motility along a chemical gradient toward prey) is likely to synergize with this chemokinesis to further improve predation. Finally, we quantitatively analyzedCapsaspora’s previously reported chemotaxis behavior. These findings lay a foundation for characterizing the mechanisms of regulated motility in a predator of a human pathogen and a model for the ancestor of animals.",

    "title": "HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr possesses a cryptic p300-dependent transcription-promoting activity that is blocked by histone deacetylases in CD4+T cells",
    "abstract": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically improved the clinical prognosis for people with HIV and prevents HIV transmission. However, ART does not cure HIV infection because of a persistent, latent viral reservoir in long-lived cells such as central memory CD4+T (TCM) cells. Eliminating or preventing reservoir formation will require a better understanding of HIV-1 latency establishment. We and others have recently shown that host cell factors such as histone deacetylases (HDACs) are critical cellular factors that allow HIV-1 entry into latency. Whether HDACs interact with specific viral factors to regulate latency establishment, however, is unknown. To examine the role of individual HIV-1 accessory proteins, we constructed a panel of HIV-1 reporter strains, each expressing a single HIV-1 accessory protein, and examined them in a primary CD4+T-cell latency model. Interestingly, we found that the HDAC inhibitor (HDACi) vorinostat potently enhances the effect of the HIV-1 protein Vpr in promoting HIV expression in infected cells, suggesting that Vpr possesses a cryptic transcription-promoting activity that is restricted by HDACs. This activity was dependent on a p300-binding domain of Vpr and inhibited by a selective p300 histone acetyltransferase inhibitor. Interestingly, Vpr expression also resulted in a significant increase in the proportion of infected cells with a central memory (TCM) phenotype. Furthermore, we observed that TCMcells were more resistant to Vpr-induced apoptosis/cell death than other CD4+T-cell subtypes, indicating that Vpr expression during reservoir formation selects for latent proviruses in TCMcells. Overall, these findings suggest that Vpr plays an important role in shaping the latent reservoir and that HIV-1 latency results, in part, from an HDAC-mediated restriction of Vpr’s transcription-promoting activity. Understanding how viral factors shape the latent reservoir and how host and viral factors interact during HIV-1 latency establishment in CD4+T cells will aid in the development of new latency-targeting therapies.",

While the role of cilia in regulating signaling pathways has been extensively studied, the impact of signaling pathways on cilia formation remains less well understood. Wnt signals are critical modulators of cell fate. In this study, we investigate how modulating Wnt signaling affects cilia formation in human retinal pigment epithelial (hTERT-RPE1) cells. Our findings show that enhancement of Wnt/LRP6 signaling before serum starvation delays ciliogenesis. Cells with high baseline Wnt activity exhibited distal appendage dysregulation, failure to remove CP110-CEP97 from mother centrioles, and reduced Rab8-vesicle docking, which are critical events for cilia membrane establishment and axoneme extension. Additionally, these cells displayed reduced autophagic flux, increased mTOR kinase activity, and elevated OFD1 levels at centriolar satellites. Importantly, mTOR inhibition rescued ciliogenesis in cells with elevated Wnt activity, underscoring the interplay between these signaling pathways. Our data also indicate that insufficient Wnt signaling activation disrupts ciliogenesis, emphasizing the need for precisely regulated Wnt levels.",

    "abstract": "In vertebrates, the sclerotome is a transient embryonic structure that gives rise to various tissue support cells, including fibroblasts. However, how fibroblast precursors are guided to diverse tissues remain poorly understood. Using zebrafish, our lab has previously shown that sclerotome-derived cells undergo extensive migration to generate distinct fibroblast subtypes, including tenocytes along the myotendinous junction and fin mesenchymal cells in the fin fold. The pan-fibroblast gene platelet-derived growth factor receptor a (pdgfra), which has been implicated in cell migration across various contexts, is specifically expressed in the sclerotome and its descendants. Loss of functional Pdgfra in apdgfragene-trap mutant results in severe defects in the migration of sclerotome-derived cells, leading to a dose-dependent loss of tenocytes and fin mesenchymal cells. By combining live imaging and mosaic labeling with a membrane-bound dominant-negative tool, we demonstrate that Pdgfra acts cell-autonomously to regulate the migration of sclerotome-derived cells. In the absence of ligandpdgfab, which is expressed in the medial somite, sclerotome-derived cells fail to migrate medially, resulting in a loss of tenocytes, although they can migrate normally toward the fin fold and generate fin mesenchymal cells. Strikingly, localized expression of Pdgfab inpdgfabmutants can direct the migration of sclerotome-derived cells to both normal and ectopic locations, suggesting a chemoattractive role for the Pdgfab ligand. Together, our results demonstrate that Pdgfab/Pdgfra-mediated chemoattraction guides the migration of sclerotome-derived fibroblast precursors to specific locations, where they diversify into distinct fibroblast subtypes.",

    "title": "Viral expansion after transfer is a primary driver of influenza A virus transmission bottlenecks",
    "abstract": "For many viruses, narrow bottlenecks acting during transmission sharply reduce genetic diversity in a recipient host relative to the donor. Since genetic diversity represents adaptive potential, such losses of diversity are thought to limit the opportunity for viral populations to undergo antigenic change and other adaptive processes. Thus, a detailed picture of evolutionary dynamics during transmission is critical to understanding the forces driving viral evolution at an epidemiologic scale. To advance this understanding, we used a barcoded virus library and a guinea pig model of transmission to decipher where in the transmission process influenza A virus populations lose diversity. In inoculated guinea pigs, we show that a high level of viral barcode diversity is maintained. Within-host continuity in the barcodes detected across time furthermore indicates that stochastic effects are not pronounced within the inoculated hosts. Importantly, in both aerosol-exposed and direct contact animals, we observed many barcodes at the earliest time point(s) positive for infectious virus, indicating robust transfer of diversity through the environment. This high viral diversity is short-lived, however, with a sharp decline seen 1–2 days after initiation of infection. Although major losses of diversity at transmission are well described for influenza A virus, our data indicate that events that occur following viral transfer and during the earliest stages of natural infection have a central role in this process. This finding suggests that host factors, such as immune effectors, may have greater opportunity to impose selection during influenza A virus transmission than previously recognized.",

Targeting root causal genes has the potential to alleviate disease entirely by eliminating pathology near its onset. No existing algorithm has been designed to discover root causal genes from observational data alone. We therefore propose the Transcriptome-Wide Root Causal Inference (TWRCI) algorithm that identifies root causal genes and their causal graph using a combination of genetic variant and unperturbed bulk RNA sequencing data. TWRCI uses a novel competitive regression procedure to annotate cis and trans-genetic variants to the gene expression levels they directly cause. The algorithm simultaneously determines the sequence in which gene expression changes propagate through the system to pinpoint the underlying causal graph and estimate root causal effects. TWRCI outperforms alternative approaches across a diverse group of metrics by directly targeting root causal genes while accounting for distal relations, linkage disequilibrium, patient heterogeneity and widespread pleiotropy. We demonstrate the algorithm by uncovering the root causal mechanisms of two complex diseases, which we confirm by replication using independent genome-wide summary statistics.",

    "abstract": "A biofilm is a community of microorganisms adhered to a surface, bound together by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). They are ubiquitous in nature and develop on a range of surfaces including living tissue. Biofilms themselves typically do not negatively affect their host, but under certain conditions they can retain pathogenic features and cause a wide range of illnesses including persistent or chronic infections. In this study, we look at the bacteriumEnterococcus faecalis.E. faecalisis a gram-positive, commensal bacterium commonly found in the human gastrointestinal tract. Generally, commensalE. faecalisdoes not negatively impact human health, but pathogenic strains have been found to acquire mobile genetic elements, including plasmids. WhenE. faecaliswith the pCF10 plasmid forms a biofilm it constructs raised complex structures with variable cellular packing, including aggregates, instead of a homogeneous and less densely packed biofilm above a rigid base. This reconfiguration of the biofilm confers resistance to high levels of erythromycin. For this study, we carried out biological experiments which show that pCF10-containingE. faecalisbiofilms undergo a rapid reconfiguration of its initial architecture, resulting in a doubling of cellular population over a single hour of antibiotic treatment. We developed a mathematical and computational model, calibrated using image processing techniques, to identify the characteristics of the biofilm’s spatial architecture that allow for the rapid one-hour reconfiguration under treatment. This model involves both stochastic cellular automata and deterministic partial differential equations. The numerical simulations carried out in this study demonstrate that biofilm survival requires both the robust formation of initial complex structures and an associated extracellular DNA (eDNA) cloud. These findings highlight the fundamental role of biofilm heterogeneity, containing aggregated structures with an associated eDNA cloud, in erythromycin resistance ofE. faecaliswith the pCF10 plasmid. The identification of eDNA as a target to increase the susceptibility of the biofilm to erythromycin could ultimately improve antibiotic treatment protocols.",

Ecological theory predicts the necessity of structural constraints on the network of species interactions to allow for growth and persistence of multi-species communities. However, the mechanisms behind their emergence are not well understood. An understanding of how the coexistence of diverse species interaction types could influence the development of complexity and how a persistent composition of interactions could arise in nature is needed. Using an eco-evolutionary model, we investigate the assembly of complex species interaction networks with multiple interaction types and its consequences for ecosystem stability. Our results show that highly mutualistic communities promote complex and stable network configurations, thus resulting in a positive complexity-stability relationship. We show that evolution by speciation enhances the emergence of such conditions compared to a purely ecological assembly scenario of repeated invasions by migrating species. Furthermore, communities evolved in isolation promote a disproportionately higher complexity and a larger diversity of outcomes. Our results produce valuable theoretical insight into the mechanisms behind the emergence of ecological complexity and into the roles of mutualism and speciation in community formation.",

Even with broad-scale efforts to characterize the effects of molecular perturbations and interpret gene coexpression, it remains challenging to infer the architecture of gene regulation in a precise and efficient manner. Key properties of GRNs, like hierarchical structure, modular organization, and sparsity, provide both challenges and opportunities for this objective. Here, we seek to better understand properties of GRNs using a new approach to simulate their structure and model their function. We produce realistic network structures with a novel generating algorithm based on insights from small-world network theory, and we model gene expression regulation using stochastic differential equations formulated to accommodate modeling molecular perturbations. With these tools, we systematically describe the effects of gene knockouts within and across GRNs, finding a subset of networks that recapitulate features of a recent genome-scale perturbation study. With deeper analysis of these exemplar networks, we consider future avenues to map the architecture of gene expression regulation using data from cells in perturbed and unperturbed states, finding that while perturbation data are critical to discover specific regulatory interactions, data from unperturbed cells may be sufficient to reveal regulatory programs.",

    "abstract": "Although the brain’s structural and functional alterations with age are individually well documented, how differences in cognitive abilities emerge from variations in the underlying spatio-temporal patterns of regional brain activity is largely unknown. Patterns of increased synchronization between brain regions are taken as enhanced cognitive integration, while decreased synchronization is indicative of cognitive segregation. The ability to dynamically switch between different levels of integration and segregation across different cognitive systems is believed to be crucial for overall cognitive performance. Building on a recently proposed cognitively informed, synchronization-based framework, we study here age-related variations in dynamical flexibility between segregation and integration, as captured by changes in the variable patterns of partial synchronization or chimera states. Leveraging personalized brain network models based on large-scale, multisite datasets of cross-sectional healthy cohorts, we systematically show how regional brain stimulation produces distinct patterns of synchronization. We find that chimera states play a crucial role in regulating the balance between cognitive integration and segregation as the brain ages, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying cognitive decline and preservation in aging. Whereas the emergent synchronization behavior of brain regions belonging to the same cognitive system often show the same aging trends, different cognitive systems can demonstrate distinct trends. This supports the idea that aging affects cognitive systems differently and that understanding this variability is essential for a more comprehensive view of neuro-cognitive aging. At the same time, dynamical flexibility increases in the oldest age groups across most cognitive systems. This may reflect compensatory mechanisms to counteract age-related cognitive declines and points towards a phenomenon of dedifferentiation. Yet, the multiplicity of behaviors highlights that whereas dedifferentiation emerges in certain cognitive systems, differentiation can also occur in others. This illustrates that these processes, though seemingly oppositional, can coexist and unfold in parallel across different cognitive systems.",

We sought to explore whether those systems are also important for FQ persistence ofPseudomonas aeruginosa, a common cause of lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients, which can be treated with FQs such as ciprofloxacin (CIP). Notably,P. aeruginosahas important differences in its DNA damage repair capabilities compared toE. colithat include the machinery needed to conduct non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), Ku and LigD. Using a genetic approach, we found that loss of HR significantly depressed persister levels ofP. aeruginosato CIP during stationary-phase, but not in exponential-phase. This differed fromE. coligrown in identical conditions, where loss of HR reduced survival in both stationary- and exponential-phase populations. Similarly, an inability to induce the SOS response reduced survival during both growth phases forE. colibut only in stationary-phase forP. aeruginosa. Loss of NHEJ machinery inP. aeruginosadid not impact persister levels during stationary- or exponential-phase, whereas overexpression of NHEJ machinery inP. aeruginosahad toxic effects. In addition, the generality of findings to another FQ, levofloxacin, and a recent clinical isolate, MRSN 1612, were confirmed. These results demonstrate that HR and the SOS response are important to CIP persistence of stationary-phaseP. aeruginosa, dispensable to CIP persisters in growingP. aeruginosacultures, and that the contributions of systems toE. colipersistence do not directly translate to persisters ofP. aeruginosa.",

Previous studies have shown thatKif15(Kinesin-12), a microtubule-associated motor protein, affects neurite growth, navigation, and branching during neuronal development, revealing the potential ofKif15to influence neuronal dendritic morphology. A GWAS study in a European population showed that there were variants in both exons and introns of theKIF15gene on chromosome 3 in patients with depression. Therefore, we generatedKif15-/-mice using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. In this study, we found thatKif15-/-mice have exhibited significant impacts on dendritic morphology and function, which contributes to mood disorders. Compared withKif15wild-type mice, adolescentKif15-/-mice showed a significant decrease in the excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD95 and NMDA receptors, as well as a reduction in the total density of dendritic spines and the density of mushroom spines, and a decrease in the frequency of mEPSCs. Meanwhile, the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold protein Gephyrin and GABRB1 significantly upregulated. However, the adultKif15-/-mice simultaneously exhibited an obvious manic behavior and their PSD95 expression increased rapidly, even more than that of theKif15wild-type mice. Meanwhile, overexpression ofKif15inkif15−/−zebrafish rescued their depressive behavior. In terms of molecular mechanism, we showed that KIF15 interacted with PSD95 protein using both endogenous and exogenous Co-IP assays. Furthermore, we found that PSD95 inKif15-/-mice was distributed around neuronal nuclei, in contrast to PSD95 localized close to the cell membrane inKif15wild-type mice. In conclusion, our study has identified a microtubule-associated molecular motor, KIF15, that plays a novel role in bipolar disorder through its contributions to spine morphology and function.",

In Arabidopsis, age-dependent reduction in the related microRNAs miR156 and miR157 controls transitions from juvenile to adult vegetative phase and from adult to reproductive phase. However, whether these miRNA isoforms have specific contributions remains unclear. To compare their roles, we used Trans-kingdom, rapid, affordable Purification of RISCs (TraPR) for small RNA sequencing, CRISPR-Cas9, and confocal imaging. We show that in shoot apices, levels of miR156 in RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) decline more rapidly than those of miR157, so that miR157 is more abundant than miR156 in RISCs of older plants undergoing floral transition and inflorescence development. Accordingly, confocal microscopy analysis showed thatMIR156AandMIR156Care not detectably expressed in shoot apices of older plants, whereas at this stageMIR157Cis expressed in upper stems, andMIR157Dis expressed in axils of inflorescence leaves. Arabidopsis flowers much earlier under long days (LDs) than short days (SDs). CRISPR-inducedmir157cmutations but notmir156acmutations accelerated flowering under SDs, and altered inflorescence leaf morphology. Notably,mir157cmutations also caused early flowering inArabis alpina, a perennial relative of Arabidopsis, indicating that the repression of flowering by this paralogue is evolutionarily conserved. SPL15 transcription factor promotes flowering under SDs and its mRNA is a target of miR156/miR157. SPL15 abundance was higher in apices ofmir157 cdmutants under SDs, andspl15mutations partially suppressed the early flowering ofmir157cmutants and this effect was enhanced byspl4mutation. We show by genetic analysis that the florigen FLOWERING LOCUS T overcomes the requirement for SPL15 in LDs but not SDs, contributing to the increased importance of theMIR157C–SPL15module under SDs. We conclude thatMIR157genes have important evolutionarily conserved roles in repressing floral transition and modulating inflorescence development of older plants under SDs.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated the feasibility, safety, and acceptability of self-collected vaginal samples for human papillomavirus (HPV) testing among pregnant women in an urban teaching hospital in Malaysia. This cross-sectional study recruited pregnant women aged 30 years and above who attended antenatal care at the University of Malaya Medical Centre. Participants self-collected vaginal samples using FLOQSwabs and completed pre- and post-sampling questionnaires assessing acceptability. Samples were analysed using the Roche cobas 4800 system. HPV-positive participants were referred for postpartum colposcopy. A total of 2,256 eligible pregnant women were invited to participate in the study and 1,603 of them consented to participate, representing 71.1% of uptake. Of the 1,603 participants, 99.6% (1,596) agreed to self-collect, with 98.6% successfully completing the procedure. More than 80% of participants responded positively to acceptability indicators after self-collection procedure, including overall feeling, ease of performance, convenience, and confidence in collecting an accurate sample. The HPV prevalence recorded in the study population was 6.3%, with most infections involving non-HPV16/18 types. No major complications associated with the sampling procedure were reported, and 99.0% of participants expressed willingness to use self-collection for future cervical screening. Self-collection for HPV-based cervical screening during pregnancy is highly acceptable, safe, and feasible, with performance comparable to the general population. Integrating self-collection into antenatal care can enhance cervical cancer screening rates among under-screened populations, contributing to global elimination goals.",

    "title": "Institutionalising community participation in decision-making in maternal and newborn health services in low-and middle-income countries: An analysis from 102 national health ministries",
    "abstract": "In 2024, 194 countries endorsed World Health Assembly Resolution (WHA77.2) to strengthen participation in health-related decision-making. Achieving this requires strong leadership to institutionalise community participation by embedding it into health system functions. However, efforts are often fragmented and short-term, hindering both sustainability and scalability. There is limited understanding of how well countries have institutionalised community participation in decision-making for quality maternal and newborn health services. A secondary analysis of maternal and newborn health survey data was conducted using responses from 102 Ministries of Health in low-and middle-income countries. The analysis assessed progress in adopting and implementing maternal and newborn health recommendations on community participation. A descriptive approach was used to summarise the frequency of reported community participation activities. Percentages were applied to describe the data, which was disaggregated by 2024–2025 World Bank classifications for income level, and fragile and conflict-affected settings.Country responses were categorised using Lasswell’s Policy Cycle heuristic. The findings indicate substantial gaps in institutionalising community participation in maternal and newborn health. Only half of countries reported integrating participation into national plans, and just one-third into implementation. In 90% of countries, parent groups were reported to be either absent or lacking influence on policymaking. National research on community participation, essential for evidence-based decision-making, was rarely reported. Across all regions, countries had varied progress, reflecting a diverse and uneven landscape of community participation. Stronger efforts are required to institutionalise community participation across the maternal and newborn health policy cycle. Strengthening this integration will require clear metrics to track implementation, enabling more accurate assessments of progress and accountability. Identifying countries where institutionalisation is advancing can surface positive deviance cases. Studying these in-depth may reveal drivers and effective strategies for fostering community participation to guide the adaption and integration of successful approaches into national health systems.",

    "abstract": "A comprehensive understanding of emergency care is an essential skill for all medical students to effectively manage emergency situations. The aim of this study was to evaluate healthcare professional students’ understanding of basic life support (BLS) and to identify the factors that influence this knowledge. A Multi-center cross-sectional study was conducted across eight educational institutions in the Dhaka, Jashore, and Sylhet divisions of Bangladesh from January to June 2024, which included final-year medicine, physiotherapy, and nursing students. A total of 486 participants were selected by the convenience sampling method. A bi-variable and multi-variable logistic regression analysis was carried out and the p-value was set at <0.05. In this study, 73.3% of participants had inadequate knowledge in basic component (BC) and 82.5% of participant had inadequate knowledge in individual component (IC) of BLS. Medicine students demonstrated a threefold increased understanding of BLS in its BC (AOR 2.80; 95% CI 1.70–4.61, p = 0.001). Participants who completed the BLS course demonstrated a twofold increase in knowledge of BLS (AOR 2.14; 95% CI 0.82–5.60, p = 0.123) regarding the BC. In contrast, female students demonstrated significantly lower knowledge of the IC of basic life support (AOR 0.56; 95% CI 0.33–0.93, p = 0.025). Medicine students (AOR 2.36; 95% CI 1.25–4.46, p = 0.009) and nursing students (AOR 2.26; 95% CI 1.18–4.32, p = 0.014) exhibited a significantly better understanding of the IC of BLS. Participants who had already taken the BLS course knew four times as much about each part of BLS (AOR 3.98; 95% CI 1.54–10.27, p = 0.004). This research indicates that healthcare professional students in Bangladesh possess insufficient knowledge of BLS. It is crucial for national health policymakers to priorities this finding and implement training programs for students, as well as professionals.",

    "title": "The utility of infectious disease modelling in informing decisions for outbreak response: A scoping review",
    "abstract": "Infectious disease modelling plays a critical role in guiding decisions during outbreaks. However, ongoing debates over the utility of these models highlight the need for a deeper understanding of their exact role in decision-making. In this scoping review we sought to fill this gap, focusing on challenges and facilitators of translating modelling insights into actionable policies. We searched the Ovid database to identify modelling studies that included an assessment of utility in informing policy and decision-making from January 2019 onwards. We further identified studies based on expert judgement. Results were analysed descriptively. The study was registered on the Open Science Framework platform. Out of 4007 screened and 12 additionally suggested studies, a total of 33 studies were selected for our review. None of the included articles provided objective assessments of utility but rather reflected subjectively on modelling efforts and highlighted individual key aspects for utility. 27 of the included articles considered the COVID-19 pandemic and 25 of the articles were from high-income countries. Most modelling efforts aimed to forecast outbreaks and evaluate mitigation strategies. Participatory stakeholder engagement and collaboration between academia, policy, and non-governmental organizations were identified as key facilitators of the modelling-for-decisions pathway. However, barriers such as data inconsistencies and quality, uncoordinated decision-making, limited funding and misinterpretation of uncertainties hindered effective use of modelling in decision-making. While our review identifies crucial facilitators and barriers for the modelling-for-decisions pathway, the lack of rigorous assessments of the utility of modelling for decisions highlights the need to systematically evaluate the impact of infectious disease modelling on decisions in future.",

    "abstract": "Workers in food processing industries are subject to many occupational health risks and disparities, but little is known about their risk of tickborne diseases. We examined a cohort of Latino individuals working in the meat packing, produce processing, and farming industries and their family members in central North Carolina, where incidence of tickborne infections is high. Blood samples were tested for IgG antibodies against Spotted Fever Group Rickettsiosis (SFGR) andEhrlichia chaffeensis. Covariates of interest included age, sex, primary language, work industry, indoor vs. outdoor work, home characteristics, medical comorbidities, and travel history. Among 201 Latino food processing workers and their family members, the seroprevalence of SFGR andEhrlichiawas 14.9% and 19.9%, respectively. Almost a third of participants were seropositive for at least one infection. SFGR seropositive individuals were significantly older than seronegative individuals (median 45 [interquartile range 35–55] vs. 33 [14–45] years, p < 0.001), whileEhrlichiaseropositivity appeared to have a bimodal distribution by age, with peaks in children under age 10 and adults in their forties and fifties. Farm workers had higher seroprevalence of SFGR (25.0%) than other workers (13.5%), although this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.13). Having a seropositive household member for either infection was a risk factor for seropositivity for the same infection, adjusted for age and household clustering (adjusted OR [aOR] 8.26, 95% CI [confidence interval] 3.27-20.90 for SFGR; aOR 11.24, 95% CI 4.24-29.80 forEhrlichia). Seroprevalence for SFGR andEhrlichiawas similar between index workers and household members when adjusted for age. Our findings indicate that Latino food processing communities in North Carolina have high exposure to tickborne disease, and older age and having seropositive household members are key risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Adequate nurturing care behaviours, including feeding practices, health-seeking and psychosocial stimulation, are crucial for the optimal health, growth and development of young children. However, several factors, recognised as maternal ‘capabilities for care’, can influence a mother’s capability to provide adequate care, namely knowledge/beliefs, physical health and nutritional status, mental health, autonomy, reasonable workload/time availability and social support. As part of the Khula birth cohort study, we aimed to investigate if maternal capabilities for care are associated with nurturing care behaviours among mother-child dyads in Malawi (n = 122) and South Africa (n = 206). When children were 10–16 months of age, mothers competed a series of self-reported sociodemographic, child diet and health and psychosocial questionnaires. Six maternal capabilities for care were considered: haemoglobin concentration, mental health, employment, decision-making autonomy, support for childcare and social support. The nurturing care behaviours were feeding practices, complete immunisation status appropriate to chid age and psychosocial stimulation within the home environment. Regression modelling assessed associations between maternal capabilities for care and each care behaviour, adjusting for child sex, maternal age and education level and household socioeconomic status. Associations between maternal capabilities for care and nurturing care behaviours differed by care behaviour and setting. Maternal employment and decision-making as measures of autonomy, support with childcare as a measure of reasonable workload and reported social support were the maternal capabilities most consistently associated with feeding practices, complete immunisation status and stimulation practices, although the direction of associations differed between settings. Maternal haemoglobin and mental health were associated with one care behaviour each (stimulation and feeding practices, respectively). Measuring and understanding how various maternal capabilities influence caregiving across contexts is essential for empowering caregivers to provide optimal care. Interventions, programmes and policies that seek to improve child health, growth and development through enhanced nurturing care practices should strengthen multiple maternal capabilities.",

    "title": "Perceptions on vaccines, vaccine communication and information needs of healthcare professionals involved in older adult vaccination: A cross-country interview study",
    "abstract": "The global population of older adults is growing. Older adults are more vulnerable to infectious diseases compared to younger adults. Vaccines are available to protect older adults against several infectious diseases, yet their uptake remains sub-optimal. Healthcare professionals (HCP) play an important role in vaccine decisions of older adults and subsequently they could improve the vaccine uptake. This study aims to identify HCPs’ awareness, attitudes and perceptions regarding older adult vaccination. Moreover, the study investigates HCPs’ information needs, information seeking behaviour and factors influencing older adult vaccine communication. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 79 HCPs involved in older adult vaccination in Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands and France. The interview guide was inspired by the Integrated Change Model (I-Change Model) and included both questions about existing vaccines and hypothetical new vaccines. All interviews were transcribed verbatim and subjected to a process of coding. Thematic analysis was performed and cross-country comparisons were made. Participants in all four countries generally shared positive views about vaccines although some reservations regarding vaccines were also shared. In case of a hypothetical new vaccine, HCPs in all countries indicated a need for information on disease and vaccine characteristics, including on efficacy, side-effects and contra-indications. The introduction of new vaccines and patient questions were drivers for information seeking among HCPs. Main sources of information used by HCPs were scientific articles and national institutes. Participants mentioned factors that could either prevent them from discussing vaccines or hamper the conversation. They expressed a desire to further develop their communication skills on vaccines. Information provision for HCPs is crucial to increase their awareness and knowledge on vaccines. However, information alone is insufficient to adequately prepare HCPs for discussing vaccines with older adults. Dedicated learning activities to acquire communication skills about vaccines are also needed.",

    "abstract": "Using modern contraceptives is essential for promoting economics, limiting the space of pregnancies, and improving maternal and newborn health outcomes. Despite progress in Cambodia, disparities in contraceptive use persist, particularly across socio-demographic and geographic groups. This study examined the prevalence and determinants of modern contraceptive use among married and sexually active women of reproductive age (15–49 years) in Cambodia, focusing on geographic and socio-demographic factors. This cross-sectional analysis of individual women’s data from the 2021–2022 Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS), including those of 13,492 women. Modern contraceptive use was defined as the self-reported current use of methods such as sterilization, IUDs, implants, pills, injectables, condoms, and emergency contraception. Descriptive and logistic regression models were used to examine associations with factors such as geographic accessibility (distance to healthcare, transportation, residence, regions), socio-demographic characteristics, and healthcare access. The prevalence of modern contraceptive use was 45%, higher in rural areas (47%) than in urban areas (41.4%). Women living 20–40 minutes from healthcare facilities were less likely to use contraceptives (AOR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.75–0.99) compared to those within 20 minutes. Motorcycle ownership was positively associated with contraceptive use (AOR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.09–1.53). Higher odds of use were observed among women with two children (AOR = 29.33, 95% CI: 20.04–42.91) or three or more children (AOR = 30.76, 95% CI: 20.50–46.16). Contraceptive use was lower among wealthier women and those aged 35–49 compared to younger women (15–19). These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions, including expanded rural healthcare, transportation solutions, and tailored awareness campaigns, to improve equitable access to family planning services and support Cambodia’s health goals.",

    "title": "Low-dose calcium supplementation during pregnancy in low and middle-income countries: A cost-effectiveness analysis",
    "abstract": "Calcium supplementation during pregnancy can reduce the risk of preeclampsia and preterm birth. Few countries have implemented WHO-recommended high-dose calcium supplementation (1500–2000mg/day), due to adherence and cost concerns. However, low-dose calcium supplementation (one 500mg tablet daily) has recently been shown to be similarly efficacious as high-dose supplementation. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of low-dose calcium supplementation during pregnancy, in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with low dietary calcium intake. To do so, we conducted a mathematical modelling analysis in which we estimated the lifetime health outcomes (cases, deaths, and DALYs averted) and costs of low-dose calcium supplementation provided through routine antenatal care to women giving birth in 2024, as compared to no supplementation. We assessed costs (2022 USD) from a health system perspective, including cost-savings from averted care for preeclampsia and preterm birth. This analysis showed that low-dose calcium supplementation could prevent 1.3 (95% uncertainty interval: 0.2, 2.6) million preterm births (a 10% (2, 18) reduction), 1.8 (1.0, 2.8) million preeclampsia cases (a 23% (14, 32) reduction), as well as 5.9 (1.3, 12.9) million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Intervention costs would be $267 (220, 318) million and produce cost-savings of $56 (26, 86) million, with incremental costs per DALY averted of $90 (38, 389) across all countries, and a return on investment of 19.1 (3.8, 39.5). The intervention was cost-effective in 119 of 129 countries modeled when compared to setting-specific cost-effectiveness thresholds. While there was substantial uncertainty in several inputs, cost-effectiveness conclusions were robust to parameter uncertainty and alternative analytic assumptions. Based on these results, low-dose calcium supplementation provided during pregnancy is cost-effective for prevention of preeclampsia and preterm birth in most LMICs.",

    "abstract": "Methadone Maintenance Treatment is one of Kenya’s evidence-based interventions and is stipulated in national policies and guidelines as both a harm reduction and addiction management intervention for opioid use disorder. It is provided free of charge at public health facilities where patients are required to come daily for treatment. Despite being free, patient-incurred costs such as transport, lost income and other daily expenses may pose barriers for treatment continuity, particularly in low resource settings such as Kenya. This cross-sectional study examined patient-incurred costs of daily methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) at a national teaching and referral hospital in Nairobi, Kenya. A total of 249 patients (80.32% male, 19.68% female) were surveyed using a socio-demographic questionnaire and a modified Drug Abuse Treatment Cost Analysis Program: Client (Outpatient) Version. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests were used to explore the association between patient demographic characteristics and treatment costs. Key findings showed a median age 40 years (IQR: 33–45), with 83.53% having a monthly household income $134.42. Patients travelled an average distance of 10 km daily and spent approximately 24 hours weekly seeking treatment. The median total direct cost was $ 22.6 per month (IQR: $13.2 – 37.6), while the median monthly income loss was $26.9 (IQR: $13.4 - $43.7). Female gender, higher education levels, household incomes, and current employment were significantly associated with greater costs and income losses (p < 0.05). Although MMT is free in Kenya, patients spent considerable time and opportunity costs in seeking treatment potentially compromising treatment adherence and long-term treatment outcomes. These findings suggest a need for decentralized services, take home dosing, and integrated livelihood programs to enhance MMT accessibility and effectiveness in resource-limited settings.",

    "title": "Tracking the urban spread of Usutu virus in southern France: Detection across biological and environmental matrices",
    "abstract": "The Usutu virus, a neurotropicOrthoflavivirustransmitted by mosquitoes, was first identified in South Africa in 1959 and has progressively spread across Europe over the past two decades. This virus follows an enzootic cycle between mosquitoes and birds, leading to periodic outbreaks that have caused significant bird mortality. Although primarily an avian pathogen, Usutu virus can occasionally infect humans and other mammals who act as incidental or dead-end hosts. The repeated avian epizootics observed in Europe in the last two decades raise concerns about potential zoonotic risks, even though human infections remain rare. In most cases, human infection is either asymptomatic or results in mild symptoms. However, in some instances, Usutu virus has been linked to severe neurological conditions, including encephalitis and meningoencephalitis. The Occitanie region in the south of France is particularly vulnerable to this threat due to its ecosystem, which harbors both competent mosquito vectors and numerous avian hosts that act as amplifying hosts for the virus. We investigated the urban circulation of Usutu virus in the city of Montpellier, where the first human case of infection by this virus in France was previously identified. To assess the presence of Usutu virus, we conducted a repeated cross-sectional study using serological (ELISA, microneutralization) and molecular (RT-qPCR) analyses of captive avifauna, including a longitudinal study of captive birds at the Montpellier zoological park between 2016 and 2024. Additionally, in 2024, we completed our study with avian cloacal swabs, pigeon droppings, rat blood, mosquito faeces, and environmental water samples (dPCR). Our findings revealed active circulation of the Usutu virus in the urban environment over multiple years. Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility of detecting the virus in droppings and environmental waters, highlighting the potential of environmental surveillance as a non-invasive and large-scale method. This study contributes to a better understanding of Usutu virus circulation and highlights its established presence in urban areas.",

    "abstract": "Chromoblastomycosis (CBM) and mycetoma, as implantation mycoses, have been listed as neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) by the World Health Organization. The concurrent occurrence of these two NTDs in a single patient is extremely rare. A 69-year-old female patient presented with papules on the dorsum of her left hand for over 5 months and nodules on the left lower limb accompanied by ulceration and pain for 20 days. Histopathological examination of the papule on the dorsum of the left hand revealed muriform cells and fungal culture of the tissue identifiedFonsecaea monophora. Microscopic examination of the purulent secretion from the ulcer on the left lower calf revealed the presence of grains, and the tissue culture result wasScedosporium apiospermacomplex, with metagenomic next-generation sequencing further identifyingS. dehoogiias the predominant pathogen. The clinical diagnosis was CBM caused byF. monophoracombined with eumycetoma due toS. dehoogii.The patient was treated with voriconazole at a dosage of 200 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, after which the papules on the dorsum of the left hand and the ulcer on the left lower calf showed gradual improvement. This case represents the first reported instance of concurrent CBM caused byF. monophoraand eumycetoma due toS. dehoogii, providing a novel perspective on the clinical manifestations and early identification of neglected implantation mycoses.",

This may potentially increase the incidence of Big Four species (Bungarus caeruleus,Daboia russelii,Echis carinatus, andNaja naja) envenomation, a notable human-health risk that has not yet been assessed in India being the most affected country in South Asia. Therefore, this study integrates species distributions with socioeconomic and healthcare data to prioritize areas for targeted interventions to mitigate the envenomation risks effectively in India.",

    "title": "Identification of aKingella kingaefactor H binding protein that is the major determinant of serum resistance",
    "abstract": "Kingella kingaeis a Gram-negative bacterium that has emerged as a leading cause of invasive disease in children between 6 months and 4 years of age.K. kingaeinitiates infection by colonizing the oropharynx, then breaches the oropharyngeal epithelium, enters the bloodstream, and disseminates to distant sites to cause disease, including osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and endocarditis. To survive in the bloodstream and disseminate to sites of invasive disease,K. kingaeproduces a polysaccharide capsule and an exopolysaccharide that inhibit opsonin deposition and mediate resistance to complement-mediated serum killing. However, elimination of these extracellular polysaccharides only partially reducesK. kingaesurvival in human serum, suggesting that additional factors contribute to serum resistance. In this study, we found thatK. kingaebinds human factor H (FH), a negative regulator of the alternative complement pathway. In experiments using rat serum as a source of complement, we observed thatK. kingaewas able to utilize human FH to resist killing. Introduction of exogenous human FH into the juvenile rat infection model ofK. kingaedisease enhanced virulence in vivo, demonstrating the importance of FH binding in the pathogenesis of disease. Far-western blot analysis identified a 37-kDa outer membrane protein designated KK02920 that was responsible for FH binding and enhanced virulence in vivo in the presence of human FH. Loss of KK02920 virtually abrogated serum resistance, indicating that KK02920 is the major determinant ofK. kingaeserum resistance. Additional analysis revealed the presence of KK02920 across a collection of serum-resistant invasive and carrierK. kingaeisolates, all of which can utilize human FH to resist complement-mediated killing. This work demonstrates the importance of a complement-regulator binding protein as a major mechanism of serum resistance in an encapsulated organism.",

    "title": "A divergent cyclic nucleotide binding protein promotesPlasmodiumookinete infection of the mosquito",
    "abstract": "Colonisation of mosquitos by the malarial parasite is critically reliant on the invasive ookinete stage. Ookinete invasion of mosquito is coordinated by the apical complex, a specialised parasite structure containing components for secretion, attachment and penetration. While studies have investigated cytoskeletal and secretory elements, it is currently unknown if signalling modules are present or functional at the apical complex. Here we elucidate the role of a cryptic cyclic nucleotide-binding protein which we name CBP-O. PbCBP-O showed a marked localisation to the ookinete apex and disruption of the protein severely compromised ookinete invasion of mosquitos. Domain dissection analysis revealed that the N- and C-termini have distinct functions. Intriguingly, PbCBP-O exhibits dual binding specificity to both cGMP and cAMP. Our findings suggest the apical tip of the ookinete is a platform to transduce cyclic nucleotide signals essential for malaria parasite transmission.",

    "title": "Human papillomavirus genomes associate with active host chromatin during persistent viral infection",
    "abstract": "Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) maintain their genomes as minichromosomes in the nuclei of infected keratinocytes. This study investigates the association of HPV31 genomes with host chromatin using both HiC and 4C-seq chromosome conformation capture techniques. We show that HPV31 genomes preferentially associate with transcriptionally active A compartments of host chromatin, regions of open chromatin defined by ATAC-seq, and super-enhancers defined by Brd4 and H3K27ac ChIP-seq. The viral genome association sites were also highly correlated with genomic loci previously identified as common HPV integration sites in cervical cancers. Recent studies have shown that transcriptionally active sites are prone to dsDNA breaks, and we find a strong correlation among dsBREAK datasets with transcriptionally active and open regions of host chromatin and the HPV31 genome association sites defined in our study. These findings suggest that HPV genomes associate with cellular transcriptional epicenters to maintain active viral gene expression during persistent infection, but also indicate that the susceptibility of these regions to dsDNA breaks could explain their propensity for viral DNA integration in HPV-associated cancers.",

    "title": "Spatiotemporal coordination of reovirus peripheral core replication to perinuclear whole virus assembly",
    "abstract": "Reoviruses coordinate their replication and assembly through intricate spatial and temporal compartmentalization within host cells. In this study, we elucidate the dynamics of mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) core replication and viral particle assembly. Using high-resolution immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, we tracked input cores and de novo cores, revealing that input cores initially form peripheral, OC-negative factories that migrate inward while seeding independent peripheral factories. Over time, these input factories transition into intermediate core-plus-outercapsid (OC) factories, which are essential for full virion assembly in the perinuclear region. Notably, de novo core proteins predominantly form independent peripheral factories that can merge or mix with others, resulting in interconnected networks. We further demonstrate that microtubules are dispensable for early core movement and factory formation but are crucial for the transition of mature, assembled virions into perinuclear deposits and for timely virion production. Disruption of microtubules delays full virus assembly, reducing progeny yield. Our findings reveal a complex, regulated interplay between spatial organization and cytoskeletal components during reovirus infection, providing insights into mechanisms that could be targeted for antiviral interventions.",
