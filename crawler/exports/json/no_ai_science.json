    "title": "Investigating the Aliso Canyon gas blowout disaster and adverse birth outcomes: A quasiexperimental approach",
    "abstract": "AbstractOn 23 October 2015, operators at the Aliso Canyon Natural Gas Storage field in Northern Los Angeles reported an uncontrolled natural gas leak. The blowout persisted for 112 days, releasing ~109,000 metric tons of methane into the atmosphere. Elevated air toxics and fine particle pollutant levels were also measured in nearby communities. We used California’s birth records and a quasiexperimental design to assess whether pregnant women living in affected communities during the disaster experienced more adverse birth outcomes than expected. Overall, the prevalence of low birthweight and term low birthweight were 45 to 100% higher than expected among women living in the affected communities whose late pregnancy overlapped with the blowout. The strongest effects were observed among women living directly south and southwest of the facility. Furthermore, we observed a dose-response effect, where the odds of low birthweight were highest among women living closest to the well and attenuated out.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAncient DNA has been useful in reconciling deep evolutionary relationships and responses to ecological changes in proboscideans. Here, we report the sequencing of a mitochondrial genome from a morphologically distinct Pacific mastodon, as well as from six eastern American mastodons with ages that range through the Middle and Late Pleistocene. We show that Pacific mastodons fall within a deeply divergent mitochondrial clade, extending the range of this species into western Canada and potentially Mexico. We also present evidence for at least three discrete expansion events into northeastern coastal regions and identify two new mastodon clades, which contain temporally distinct but geographically colocalized specimens. We integrate these findings with those of previous work into a comprehensive model ofMammutphylogeography.",

This timescale makes GP1992 currently the second oldest ice core in the world, much older than any other extrapolar ice cores. Here, we revisit the GP1992 timescale by dating a Guliya ice core (GP2021) that was drilled close to the GP1992 drilling site in 2021. All our data, including the absolute dates deduced from210Pb,39Ar, and14C, confirmed an age of <3 thousand years at 175.1 meters depth of GP2021, compared with ~100 thousand years previously estimated at the stratigraphically equivalent depth in GP1992. Our results resolved several discrepancies between the GP1992 and other paleoclimate records in the region, leading to different insights in climate history of the Tibetan Plateau.",

The molecular catalysts with precise structures are unique platform to decipher the electrocatalytic mechanism, but they usually suffer from low performance. Herein, we report a strain-optimized dual copper complex immobilized in mesoporous carbon, which exhibits remarkable ethylene (C2H4) Faradaic efficiency (FE) up to 49.9% along with a multicarbon (C2+) product’s FE up to 65.2% at −1.19 volts versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Concurrently, the catalyst displays considerable stability for 15 hours at a full cell potential of −3.1 volts. The density functional theory calculation reveals that the strain effect imposed by mesoporous carbon regulates the neighboring dual copper sites in the electrocatalyst to decrease the energy barrier of rate-determining step (*COCO → *COCOH), thus significantly promoting ethylene production.",

Current approaches typically rely on interconnected modules, facing challenges such as large footprint, high energy consumption, and fabrication complexity. To address these limitations, we introduce a modified organic electrochemical transistor structure called the organic electrochemical transceiver (OECTC). The OECTC leverages the electronic wettability switch characteristic of conjugated polymers to convert sensed signals into a valve mechanism for controlling the release of chemical substances (e.g., drugs and neurotransmitters). This provides an all-in-one solution for synchronized signal recording and substance release for physiological modulation. The applications of the OECTC in intelligent wearable devices for managing type II diabetes and as a neural amplifier or inverter for neurotransmitter modulation are demonstrated.",

Here, we find a group of quasi-1D superconducting materials among hexagonal perovskite chalcogenides with face-sharing connectivity. Resistance and magnetization measurements demonstrate anisotropic superconductivity in compressed barium titanium trisulfide (BaTiS3) at a low hole carrier concentration of (1.6 ± 0.1) × 1021per cubic centimeter, with the highest superconducting temperature (Tc) reaching ~9.3 kelvin. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction indicates that the superconducting phase retains a hexagonal perovskite structure consisting of quasi-1D infinite titanium hexasulfide chains. Density functional theory calculations, combined with the observed decrease in the maximumTcfrom ~9.3 to ~6.2 kelvin upon substituting sulfur with selenium, suggest that electron-phonon interactions play a key role in the pairing mechanism of superconducting BaTiX3(X = sulfur and selenium).

Here, we developed a universal enzymatic O2scavenger composed of alcohol oxidase, catalase, and paraformaldehyde to eliminate O2within the sensor by converting it to water. Unlike other oxidases, alcohol oxidase exclusively uses O2as an electron acceptor, preventing interference with the electron transfer chain involving the sensing oxidase. We demonstrated the compatibility of this O2scavenger for calibration-free sensing of glucose, lactate, and creatinine in the concentration range relevant to human health. Without the O2scavenger, sensor readings were less than 50% of those under inert gas conditions. With the O2scavenger, the accuracy improved to 99%, even at low substrate concentrations. The general compatibility and performances of this alcohol oxidase-based O2scavenger unlock the full potential of oxidase-based biosensors for reliable point-of-use sensing.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe structure of an electronic device is predetermined at its birth, necessitating new designs and fabrication processes for alternative functions. The advent of reconfigurable electronics, modifying its circuits after manufacture, has unlocked the potential for devices to perform adaptive roles as needed. However, the trade-off between the degree of freedom to reform its structure and electrical stability restricts its potential roles, diminishing the system’s significance. Here, we present a reconfigurable assembly of magnetic nanoparticles in a phase transitional matrix (RAMP) system capable of seamlessly transforming their structure with robust electrical junctions. Nanoparticles form conductive percolation under a precisely patterned magnetic field. Within a phase transitional matrix, junctions between nanoparticles are tightened, enhancing electrical performance during transitions. We demonstrated in situ electrical switching and high-resolution alternating current electroluminescence display using the RAMP system. With enhanced reconfigurability and electrical reliability, we anticipate that the RAMP system will suggest a previously unexplored approach to on-demand electronics.",

We design a two-dimensional lattice of 261 coupled silicon nitride ring resonators that supports nested mode-locked states with fast (≈1 terahertz) single-ring and slow (≈3 gigahertz) topological super-ring timescales. We observe clear signatures of multi-timescale mode locking, including a quadratic distribution of pump noise across both azimuthal mode families, consistent with theory. These findings are supported by near-transform–limited repetition beats and the emergence of periodic temporal patterns on the slow timescale. The edge-confined states show distinct dynamics from bulk and single-ring modes, enabling clear identification. Our results establish topological frequency combs as a robust platform for independently tunable, lattice-scale synchronization, opening new directions for exploring the interplay of nonlinearity and topology in integrated photonics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractGadolinium-based contrast agents revolutionized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by accelerating spin relaxation. In contrast, agents that decelerate relaxation were hitherto unknown. Such agents are highly desirable for metabolic imaging with hyperpolarized tracers such as15N-pyridine, 1,4-13C2-succinate, and 1-15N-nicotinamide, where valuable polarization decays rapidly, especially at low fields during transfer between polarizer and scanner. Here, we report on a previously unrecognized effect in which the tracers’ longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates in aqueous solution are substantially reduced by adding nicotinamide, urea, glycerol, or dendrons. The impact on longitudinal relaxation is particularly pronounced at low magnetic fields and near the tracer’s pKawhereT1can be tripled. This mitigates polarization loss during transfer, so hitherto unsuitable, fast-relaxing molecules can be used now. This way, we achieved the15N hyperpolarization of nearly 30% for 1-15N-nicotinamide. This chemically induced deceleration of nuclear spin relaxation (CIDER) was confirmed using magnetic field–cycling experiments and offers broad potential for hyperpolarized magnetic resonance and beyond.",

Thanks to the cyclic shift symmetry in the discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) of bosonic modes, the DFT measurement outcomes can be used to deterministically project multiqubit states ontoWstates. Experimentally, we show that three-qubitWstate discrimination can be achieved by detecting the cyclic shift symmetry with a three-mode DFT optical circuit, yielding a measurement discrimination fidelity of 0.871 ± 0.039. Our experimental demonstration opens the door for the development of new quantum network protocols between multipartite systems.",

Despite great advancements in 2D optoelectronic devices, achieving ultrafast and controllable photoconductivity polarity inversion with a single device remains a fundamental challenge due to the static nature of built-in electric fields at metal/2D material interfaces. This study demonstrates a transient electric field reversal at the MoTe2/Pt Schottky junction, enabling photoconductivity inversion from negative to positive within 100 ps. By applying ultrafast photocurrent detection, a minimal voltage variation (10 mV) precisely controls this transition, and a device with a remarkable photocurrent response time of 3.8 ps is proposed.

By stoichiometry-controlled polycondensation, the chain packing and microporosity of synthesized polyimides are finely regulated, verified by molecular simulations. The corresponding asymmetrical membranes with defect-free thin layers of 100 to 250 nanometers are prepared via solution casting and thermal annealing steps. Such programmed membranes enable tunable permselectivity for hydrocarbons with less than 40 carbon atoms. The fractionation of kerosene-paraffin mixture in toluene is demonstrated through a two-stage process containing the optimized membranes.

Here, we describe directing-group- and oxidant-free C(sp2)─H/C(sp2)─H CDC between arenes and styrenes/furans photocatalyzed by a PSP-pincer Rh complex to afford stilbenes/heterobiaryls under mild conditions (blue light irradiation, near room temperature). The reaction is applicable to a wide range of substrates, and undesired hydrogenation of the styrenes and stilbenes is strongly suppressed. The generated H2gas can be used for hydrogenation of alkenes in a connected flask system. Experimental mechanistic studies indicated that the Rh(I)─Ar complex is a key intermediate in the catalytic cycle, and C(sp2)─H bond cleavage of the styrenes/furans occurs via oxidative addition in the excited state.",

This study establishes aDrosophilamodel for vomiting triggered by berberine ingestion. Our findings reveal that this response is mediated by the chemoreceptor TrpA1, which is indirectly activated by berberine via the mAChRs-PLC pathway. Berberine induces acetylcholine release from foregut epithelial cells, which triggers tachykinin secretion from intestinal tracheal cells. Tachykinins contract the visceral muscles, particularly the P4 pump of the foregut, and suppress myosuppressin release from pars intercerebralis neurons, thereby promoting crop motility. We further demonstrate the conservation of key genes involved in mammalian vomiting regulation. Overall, this study provides a molecular and cellular framework for understanding vomiting and introducesDrosophilaas a genetic model for mechanistic studies.",

    "abstract": "AbstractA critical yet challenging step in protein complex assembly is the formation of a dimeric intermediate that serves as a seed for incorporating additional subunits. We hypothesized that this step could be facilitated by “bi-handed” chaperones that recognize two different subunits through distinct domains (hands). However, whether such chaperones exist remained unknown. Here, we identify AAGAB as a bona fide bi-handed chaperone. AAGAB uses its C-terminal domain (CTD) to bind the α subunit and its GTPase-like domain (GD) to bind the σ2 subunit of the AP2 adaptor complex, a central player in membrane trafficking. AAGAB first recruits α via its CTD; σ2 then joins through interaction with α, forming a conformationally immature α:σ2 hemicomplex at the CTD. This hemicomplex is subsequently transferred to the GD via a GD:σ2 binding interface, accompanied by conformational maturation. These findings establish AAGAB as the founding member of a bi-handed chaperone family and reveal an intramolecular handover mechanism that underlies their mode of action.",

    "abstract": "AbstractRetinitis pigmentosa (RP), the leading cause of inherited blindness, lacks therapies because of undefined photoreceptor degeneration mechanisms. While microglia/myeloid cells drive RP progression, their phenotype-regulating determinants remain unclear. Using rd10 mice, we reveal TREM2 as a biphasic RP regulator via STAT2–mediated microglial reprogramming. Early TREM2 loss amplifies neuroinflammation through STAT2 hyperactivation, while late deficiency triggers NF-κB/STAT2–driven microglial apoptosis, impairing phagocytosis yet preserving photoreceptors. We uncover a photoreceptor-microglia metabolic axis where apoptotic photoreceptors release arachidonic acid, salicylic acid, and creatinine to induce STAT2-dependent apoptosis in TREM2-deficient cells. Crucially, we identify intermicroglia PSAP/GPR37 signaling as a self-propagating apoptotic mechanism—the first evidence of apoptotic transmission in retinal degeneration. This study establishes three advances: (i) TREM2 exhibits stage-dependent neuroprotective/neurotoxic roles, (ii) photoreceptor metabolites dictate microglia/myeloid cell fate via STAT2, and (iii) microglial apoptosis spreads through membrane signaling complexes. Our findings redefine neuroimmune dynamics in retinal degeneration, propose chronotherapeutic TREM2 targeting, and extend to Alzheimer’s and other microglia-associated CNS disorders via metabolic-immune interplay.",

    "title": "RNA binding protein DDX3X drives pancreatic cancer progression via the TLE2-MYL9 axis",
    "abstract": "AbstractCurrent treatments for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) fall short of meeting clinical needs, highlighting the urgent need for a comprehensive understanding of PDAC progression, which involves not only biochemical signals but also essential biomechanical cues. Here, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 screen in an orthotopic xenograft model to explore PDAC dynamics. The RNA binding protein DEAD-box helicase 3X-linked (DDX3X) was identified as a pivotal oncogene and biomechanical checkpoint. Specifically, DDX3X up-regulation in PDAC promoted tumorigenesis and metastasis, primarily through the transcriptional repressor TLE family member 2 (TLE2). Dysregulation of DDX3X in the tumor destabilized TLE2 messenger RNA and therefore disrupted the interaction with KLF4 (KLF transcription factor 4), leading to increased expression of myosin light chain 9 (MYL9). This change remodeled F-actin, enhancing tumor cell traction forces and consequently facilitating tumor metastasis. Targeting the DDX3X-TLE2-MYL9 pathway considerably reduces PDAC progression. This research reveals a promising approach for treating PDAC by focusing on biomechanical cues.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPosttranslational protein modifications have emerged as a mechanism regulating progenitor cell state transitions during tissue formation. Herein, we exploit the stereotyped hair follicle development to delineate the function of PADI4, an enzyme converting peptidylarginine to citrulline. Single-cell sequencing placesPadi4in both progenitor and differentiated hair lineage cells and indicates that PADI4 acts to repress transcription during hair follicle development. We establish PADI4 as a negative regulator of proliferation, acting on LEF1-positive hair shaft committed progenitor cells. Mechanistically, PADI4 citrullinates proteins associated with mRNA processing and ribosomal biogenesis, and lack of PADI4 promotes protein synthesis and ribosomal RNA transcription in vivo. Characterizing key translational effectors, we demonstrate that PADI4 citrullinates the translational repressor 4E-BP1 and reveal a cross-talk between PADI4 activity and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. This work sheds light on how posttranslational modifications affect progenitor cell states and tissue formation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAdoptive transfer studies of ex vivo–expanded autologous cytomegalovirus (CMV)–specific CD8+T lymphocytes (CTLs) in immunocompromised hosts demonstrate a central role for viral control, but this therapeutic approach is not generally feasible. We present T cell–redirecting bispecific antibodies (TRBAs) that cross-link CD3ε on CTLs to gH protein on CMV-infected cells, including versions where a single-chain antibody is appended to the carboxyl terminus of the heavy chain of a regular antibody, or where both light and heavy chains have two tandem variable regions in a crossover ordered design. Both versions bind both antigens and mediate the specific clearance of infected cells with the release of interferon-γ when added to CTLs with CMV-infected cells. TRBA-mediated clearance is visualized with physical clustering of CTLs with CMV-infected cells. These results illustrate the mechanism and utility of these TRBAs as potential therapeutic candidates for disseminated CMV infection, with potential advantages compared to two prior CMV-specific TRBAs.",

How its main building block, the ROD-Zwilch-ZW10 (RZZ) complex, assembles on the outer kinetochore remains poorly understood. Harnessing corona biochemical reconstitutions and cell biology, we reveal that the paralogous spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) proteins BUB1 and BUBR1 promote nonredundant branches of corona assembly. MPS1 kinase–dependent kinetochore docking of BUB1 and subsequent recruitment of BUBR1 initiates assembly. Disrupting the first branch by depleting CENP-E, a kinesin that links BUBR1 to RZZ, uncovered a second assembly pathway mediated by a direct interaction between BUB1 and ROD. Discovery of a direct interaction with the RZZ explains how the SAC protein MAD1 fits this corona assembly scheme. Our findings solve the long-standing puzzle of corona assembly and demonstrate the intimate interweaving of chromosome biorientation and checkpoint signaling.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPersons with HIV (PWH) receiving integrase (IN) strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) have been reported to experience virologic failure (VF) in the absence of resistance mutations in IN. We previously reported that mutations in the viral nucleocapsid (NC) are selected in the presence of the INSTI dolutegravir (DTG). Here, we show that these NC mutations accelerate the kinetics of viral DNA integration, suggesting that they limit the window of time available for INSTIs to block viral DNA integration. We find that in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, HIV-1 acquires mutations in the viral envelope glycoprotein, NC, and occasionally IN during selection for INSTI resistance. Notably, the selected NC and IN mutations act in concert to reduce the susceptibility of the virus to INSTIs. These results provide insights into the mechanism by which HIV-1 escapes the inhibitory activity of INSTIs and underscore the importance of genotypic analysis outside IN in PWH experiencing VF on INSTI-containing drug regimens.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe interplay between cellular metabolism and immune regulation is central to immune function and disease progression, revealing notable therapeutic opportunities. Upon activation, immune cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to meet heightened demands for energy and biosynthesis, reshaping regulatory networks across epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic layers. Metabolite-derived posttranslational modifications (PTMs) serve as pivotal mechanisms integrating metabolic intermediates with immune signaling pathways. Beyond classical acetylation, diverse nonacetyl PTMs—including lactylation, succinylation, malonylation, palmitoylation, and myristoylation—modify histone and nonhistone proteins, regulating gene expression, protein stability, subcellular localization, enzymatic activity, and protein-protein interactions. Advances in mass spectrometry and bioinformatics now enable precise characterization of these PTMs, uncovering their broad roles in immune regulation. This review summarizes current progress in immunometabolism and explores future directions such as mechanistic studies, combination strategies, and clinical applications. Metabolite-driven PTMs critically connect metabolism to immune regulation, suggesting promising therapeutic approaches for cancer, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory diseases.",

However, the factors governing ETP formation remain poorly defined. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (scATAC-seq), we dissected the heterogeneity of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility landscapes in murine ETPs. Whereas Tcf1−ETPs exhibited higher proliferative capacity, Tcf1+ETPs appeared to be immediate, more robust precursors to T lineage–specified early thymocytes. Prethymic ablation of Tcf1 and its homolog Lef1 severely impaired ETP formation in vivo. Whereas ablating Tcf1 alone had limited impact, loss of both Tcf1 and Lef1 impaired transcriptional activation ofNotch1and Notch pathway effector molecules, includingHes1andHhex, accompanied by aberrantly induced B cell and myeloid gene programs. Acute deletion of both factors compromised Notch pathway, glycolysis, and T cell gene programs in emergent ETPs ex vivo. Thus, Tcf1 and Lef1 act upstream of the Notch pathway, functioning as prethymic initiators of ETP fate and intrathymic gatekeepers of ETP identity and T lineage potential.",

They can change atmospheric and soil properties and affect water quantity and quality. The increasing risk of wildfires has prompted more frequent public safety hazards around the world. Wildfires can degrade air quality both in the immediate area and in the direction where wind is blowing through long-range atmospheric transport. On page 1137 of this issue, Maet al.(1) report an observation that contradicts this conventional wisdom. They find that wildfires in the western United States can improve air quality in the eastern part of the country primarily through a process associated with heat-induced convection. The findings show that local wildfires may unexpectedly have far-reaching effects on weather in distant regions.",

Botanists were more strongly influenced by ideas such as those of Göte Turesson (2), who asserted that “the species problem is thus seen to be in a large measure an ecological problem” and believed that the exchange of genes between ecologically differentiated species through hybridization (and breeding of the hybrid and its descendants with members of one of the species) was both common and important. However, empirical evidence for either view was lacking. On page 1147 of this issue, Monnetet al.(3) report population genomic evidence that contrary to standard expectations, this exchange of genes (gene flow) between diverged plant lineages ceases at lower levels of genomic divergence than it does between animal lineages.",

This classic circuit has inspired current thinking on hippocampal functions related to learning, memory, and spatial navigation, but the potential functional contributions of other hippocampal areas, such as CA2, the fasciola cinereum, and the indusium griseum, and their integration of a major hypothalamic input, have been overlooked.

Although the role of oxytocin signaling in parental care has been widely investigated, little is known about its function in social behavior during early life. We studied the role of oxytocin in mouse pup social behavior during acute separation from the mother as well as upon reunion. The activity of oxytocin neurons was increased by acute maternal separation. Behaviorally, maternally separated pups emitted more ultrasonic vocalizations upon reunion, which were further modulated by nipple attachment behavior. These effects were attenuated by blocking the oxytocin receptor during maternal separation. Optogenetic silencing of oxytocin neurons during maternal separation disrupted vocal behavior during separation and reunion. Our findings reveal an important role of oxytocin in context-dependent vocal communication in mouse pups.",

Electrophysiological recordings in postsubiculum, the cortical head direction (HD) system hub, confirmed a preference for visual objects in both HD cells and fast-spiking interneurons. In freely moving animals, visual objects increased firing rates of HD cells aligned with a visual object but decreased activity in HD cells coding for other directions.",

However, depending on the regulated promoter identity, TF function can vary, and the principles underlying this context dependence remain unclear. We demonstrate an inverse scaling relationship between the promoter’s basal activity and its regulation by a given TF. Specifically, activation is weaker and repression is stronger on stronger promoters. This scaling applies to both activators and repressors, which suggests a common underlying mechanism where TFs regulate expression by stabilizing RNAP binding at the promoter. The consequence of this relationship is that TFs buffer expression by affecting constant regulated expression levels across promoters of different basal activity, ensuring homeostatic control despite genetic or environmental changes.",

A network of 819 pigments was found in Eh-PSI-FCPI, which functions to capture and transfer light energy with 95% quantum efficiency. This elucidates how its modular Eh-FCPI arrangement contributes to the expansion of PSI cross section and efficient light harvesting.",

    "title": "Structural basis for LZTR1 recognition of RAS GTPases for degradation",
    "abstract": "AbstractThe RAS family of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) are tightly regulated signaling molecules that are further modulated by ubiquitination and proteolysis. Leucine Zipper-like Transcription Regulator 1 (LZTR1), a substrate adapter of the Cullin-3 RING E3 ubiquitin ligase, binds specific RAS GTPases and promotes their ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We present structures of LZTR1 Kelch domains bound to RIT1, MRAS, and KRAS, revealing interfaces that govern RAS isoform selectivity and nucleotide specificity. Biochemical and structural analyses of disease-associated Kelch domain mutations revealed three types of alterations: impaired substrate interaction, loop destabilization, and blade-blade repulsion. In cellular and mouse models, mutations disrupting substrate binding phenocopied LZTR1 loss, underscoring its substrate specificity. These findings define RAS recognition mechanisms by LZTR1 and suggest a molecular glue strategy to degrade oncogenic KRAS.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBioelectronic interfaces demonstrate promising applications in health monitoring, medical treatment, and augmented reality. However, conformally wrapping these film devices onto three-dimensional surfaces often leads to stress-induced damage. We propose a “drop-printing” strategy that enables damage-free film transfer using a droplet. The droplet acts as a lubricating layer between the film and the target surface, facilitating local sliding during shape-adaptive deformation. This mechanism prevents in-plane film stretching and reduces stress concentration. Even nonstretchable and fragile films can be intactly and accurately wrapped onto delicate surfaces, such as microscale microorganisms and optical fibers. Two-micrometer-thick silicon films, without any stretchable engineering, can form conformal neural-electronic interfaces by being drop-printed on nerves and brain tissue. The interfaces achieve light-controlled in vivo neuromodulation with high spatiotemporal resolution.",

    "abstract": "AbstractInsect populations have declined worldwide, but the extent and drivers of these declines are debated. Most studies rely on field surveys performed in the past century, leaving gaps in our understanding of longer-term trends. Using a “community genomics” approach, we estimated community assembly over millions of years and more recent demographic trends of ant species in the Fijian archipelago. We found that 79% of endemic species are in decline, starting after the arrival of humans approximately 3000 years ago and accelerating in the past 300 years, whereas recent arrivals are expanding. The primary correlate of population decline among endemic species was found to be sensitivity to habitat disturbance. This study demonstrates the value of contemporary collections for estimating long-term community trends and highlights the vulnerability of endemic island species to anthropogenic change.",

    "abstract": "AbstractConventional wisdom suggests that wildfires in the western United States (WUS) degrade air quality nationwide as a result of aerosol emissions and eastward transport. However, we found that heat produced by wildfires, a commonly neglected effect, can reduce fine particle concentrations (PM2.5) in the eastern United States (EUS) by an amount comparable to the increases in the WUS during the fire season. This phenomenon arises from fire heat–induced convection in the WUS and subsequent downstream meteorological changes distant from fires. Enhanced wet deposition and weakened eastward transport of fire aerosols lower PM2.5levels in the EUS. Therefore, neglecting the effect of fire heat on PM2.5pollution leads to an overestimate of 1200 additional premature deaths and 3.3 billion USD in economic losses, particularly in the densely populated EUS.",

Protonation of neutral 4-aminobenzoic acid (4ABA) occurs at the acid (O-protomer) and amine (N-protomer) functionalities, yielding two distinct species with relative energies dependent on the degree of hydration. Here, we measured the rates of intramolecular proton transfer in 4ABAH+·(H2O)6ions upon protomer-selective vibrational excitation of initially cold (6 K) cluster ions isolated in a cryogenic ion trap. Interconversion rates were observed on the microsecond time scale. These results quantify the kinetics of proton transfers in the context of a closed, finite system at well-defined internal energies and therefore provide experimental benchmarks for theoretical efforts that are being developed to treat relatively slow, highly cooperative solvent-mediated chemical processes.",

To date, the notion that interspecific genetic exchange (introgression) occurs more frequently between plant species than animals has gained a strong footing in scientific discourse. By examining the dynamics of gene flow across a continuum of divergence in both kingdoms, we observed the opposite relationship: Plants experience less introgression than animals at the same level of genetic divergence, suggesting that species barriers are established more rapidly in plants. This pattern raises questions about which differences in microevolutionary processes between plants and animals influence the dynamics of reproductive isolation establishment at the macroevolutionary scale.",

Fresh milk samples from 30 lactating individuals, classified by milk production levels across postpartum stages, were analyzed using genomic and microbiome techniques. Bulk RNA sequencing of milk fat globules (MFGs), milk cells, and breast tissue revealed that MFG-derived RNA closely mirrors luminal milk cells. Transcriptomic and single-cell RNA analyses identified changes in gene expression and cellular composition, highlighting key genes (GLP1R,PLIN4, andKLF10) and cell-type differences between low and high producers. Infant microbiome diversity was influenced by feeding type but not maternal milk production.

    "abstract": "AbstractInsects, unlike vertebrates, use heteromeric complexes of odorant receptors and co-receptors for olfactory signal transduction. However, the secondary messengers involved in this process are largely unknown. Here, we use the olfactory signal transduction of the aggregation pheromone 4-vinylanisole (4VA) as a model to address this question. When locusts detect 4VA, the pheromone is transported by OBP10 and OBP13 to the OR35–Orco receptor complex, thereby activating downstream pathways in the antenna. A pivotal downstream molecule, the lipid-binding protein Clvs2, facilitates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate transportation across the cytolemma, providing more substrates for inositol trisphosphate (IP3) production. PLCe1, a biosynthetic enzyme, boosts IP3levels in the antennal lobe of the brain. IP3is responsible for converting chemical signals from the antenna into neural signals, confirming IP3as a secondary messenger in olfaction perception instead of GPCR in locusts. These findings elucidate the universal function of IP3in olfactory signal perception, shedding light on the key nodes of insect olfactory signal transduction.",

The heteroplasmic nature of mtDNA—where mutant and wild-type mtDNA coexist—complicates efforts to define its contribution to disease progression. In this study, bulk whole-genome sequencing of 637 matched tumor-normal samples from the Pediatric Cancer Genome Project revealed an enrichment of functionally impactful mtDNA variants in specific pediatric leukemia subtypes. Collectively, the results from single-cell sequencing of five diagnostic leukemia samples demonstrated that somatic mtDNA mutations can arise early in leukemogenesis and undergo positive selection during disease progression, achieving intermediate heteroplasmy—a “sweet spot” that balances mitochondrial dysfunction with cellular fitness. Network-based systems biology analyses link specific heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations to metabolic reprogramming and therapy resistance. We reveal somatic mtDNA mutations as a potential source of functional heterogeneity and cellular diversity among leukemic cells, influencing their fitness and shaping disease progression.",

We exploit unprecedented ocean-bottom observations using ultralong-period “tilt mechanical amplifiers,” along with hydrostatic pressure, global navigation satellite system, and satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar data. The joint inversion of these geodetic data, template-matching seismicity, and repeating earthquakes, revealed the first two shallow slow slip events (SSEs) observed in Mexico. The first one migrated from the trench to the earthquake hypocenter before rupture, and the second one occurred following anMw7.3 long-term SSE induced by the earthquake. Episodic near-trench oceanic-crust deformations (i.e., tilt transients) associated with shallow and deep synchronous decoupling of the plate interface reveal the occurrence of “slab-pull surges” before three regional earthquakes of magnitude 7 or greater, including the Acapulco event, suggesting that they may serve as rupture precursors observable in subduction zones.",

On the basis of a multimodel ensemble of historical aerosol forcing simulation for a period of global aerosol increase during 1965 to 1989, here, we show that the precipitation response shares a common southward displacement of tropical rain bands but the magnitude differs markedly among models, accounting for 76% of the intermodel uncertainty in zonal-mean precipitation change. Our analysis of atmospheric energetics further reveals key mechanisms for magnitude uncertainty: aerosol radiative forcing drives, cloud radiative feedback amplifies, and ocean circulation damps the intermodel uncertainty in cross-equatorial atmospheric energy transport change and the meridional shift of tropical rain bands. This has important implications for understanding and reducing intermodel uncertainty in anthropogenic climate change.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a key driver of global climate variability. Early-season westerly wind bursts (WWBs) have long been suggested to be important for ENSO evolution and diversity, with the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) among the main sources of WWBs. However, MJO’s contribution to ENSO evolution has been difficult to quantify. Here, using an ensemble hindcast approach specifically designed to isolate internal atmospheric variability, we evaluate the influences of March MJO on subsequent ENSO development. Our results show that the March MJO, under favorable background conditions, by itself has limited impacts on ENSO due to weak equatorial air-sea coupling in spring. In comparison, the North Pacific Oscillation–induced meridional mode exerts a more sustained influence on ENSO evolution. A cyclonic circulation anomaly over Hawaii, associated with the Pacific-North American pattern, also plays a role. These findings suggest that March MJO activity alone may not be a reliable predictor for ENSO evolution, but underscore the importance of North Pacific atmospheric variability.",

Multiomics analyses reveal activation ofTCF7and costimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules in CD8 Trpcells. CD8 Trpcells suppress T cell expansion in vitro and in vivo. In a humanized xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) model, they dampen T cell activation, alleviate GVHD pathology, and prolong survival without impairing antileukemia activity. Mechanistically, CD8 Trpcells promote immune regulation by inducing FOXP3 expression in both CD4 Tregcells and themselves. Their expansion also correlates with immune homeostasis restoration post–allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

    "title": "An early surge of norepinephrine along brainstem pathways drives sensory-evoked awakening",
    "abstract": "AbstractThe locus coeruleus–norepinephrine (LC-NE) system regulates arousal and awakening; however, it remains unclear whether the LC does this in a global or circuit-specific manner. We hypothesized that sensory-evoked awakenings are predominantly regulated by specific LC-NE efferent pathways. Anatomical, physiological, and functional modularities of LC-NE pathways involving the mouse basal forebrain (BF) and pontine reticular nucleus (PRN) were tested. We found partial anatomical segregation between theLC → PRNandLC → BFcircuits. Extracellular NE dynamics in BF and PRN exhibited distinct sound-evoked activation during sleep, including a fast sound-evoked NE peak specific to PRN. Causal optogenetic interrogation of LC efferent pathways, by retro-channelrhodopsin (ChR2) activation or Platynereis dumerilii ciliary opsin (PdCO) silencing of synapses in target regions, revealed a role for earlyLC → PRNactivity in driving arousal and sound-evoked awakenings. Together, our results uncover a role for early LC-NEPRNactivity in connecting sensory and arousal pathways and establish LC heterogeneity in regulating arousal.",

    "abstract": "AbstractContinuous monitoring of cardiovascular vital signs can reduce the incidence and mortality of cardiovascular diseases, yet cannot be implemented by current technologies because of device bulkiness and rigidity. Here, we report self-adhesive and skin-conformal ultrasonic transducer arrays that enable wearable monitoring of multiple hemodynamic parameters without interfering with daily activities. A skin-adaptive focused ultrasound method with rational array design is proposed to implement measurement under wide ranges of skin curvatures and depths with improved sensing performances. We introduce a self-adhesive hydrogel layer to enhance the acoustic impedance matching, biocompatibility and contact reliability at device-skin interfaces, and a microelectromechanical systems-compatible process for batch-to-batch and high-consistency manufacturing. The resultant transducer array, with a frequency of 2.4 megacycles per second and a –6 dB bandwidth of 47%, implements accurate and continuous detection of cardiovascular signs, including blood pressure (BP) waveforms of various arteries, heart rate and BP during exercises, and arterial stiffness, validated clinically.",

While macromolecular crowding affects multiple cellular processes in single cells, its regulation in living animals remains poorly understood. Using genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles for in vivo rheology, we found thatCaenorhabditis eleganstissues maintain mesoscale properties that differ from those observed across diverse systems, including bacteria, yeast species, and cultured mammalian cells. We identified two conserved mechanisms controlling particle mobility: Ribosome concentration, a known regulator of cytoplasmic crowding, works in concert with a previously unknown function for the giant KASH (Klarsicht/ANC-1/SYNE homology) protein ANC-1 in providing structural constraints through associating with the endoplasmic reticulum. These findings reveal mechanisms by which tissues establish and maintain distinct mesoscale properties, with implications for understanding cellular organization across species.",

    "title": "Acute REM sleep deprivation alleviated depression-like behavior mediated by inhibiting VIP neurons in the mPFC",
    "abstract": "AbstractAcute sleep deprivation (SD) rapidly alleviates depression, addressing a critical gap in mood disorder treatment. Rapid eye movement SD (REM SD) modulates the excitability of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons, influencing the synaptic plasticity of pyramidal neurons. However, the precise mechanism remains undefined. To investigate this, we used a modified multiple platform method (MMPM) to induce 12 hours of REM SD, specifically targeting VIP neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Our results show that REM SD mitigated depression by suppressing VIP neurons activity, which directly increased the excitability of pyramidal neurons and, consequently, promoted synaptic plasticity recovery. In addition, the knockdown of VPAC2 on mPFC pyramidal neurons revealed that VPAC2-mediated AC/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway in these neurons is essential for REM SD to mitigate depression-like behavior. These findings suggest that VIP neurons directly regulate pyramidal neurons and are crucial in alleviating depression by REM SD.",

    "abstract": "AbstractInfluenza A viruses remain a global health threat, yet no universal antibody therapy exists. Clinical programs have centered on neutralizing mAbs, only to be thwarted by strain specificity and rapid viral escape. We instead engineered three non-neutralizing IgG2a mAbs that target distinct, overlapping epitopes within the conserved N terminus of the M2 ectodomain (M2e). Combined at low dose, this “triple M2e-mAb” confers robust prophylactic and therapeutic protection in mice challenged with diverse human and zoonotic IAV strains, including highly pathogenic variants. Therapeutic efficacy depends on Fc-mediated effector activity via FcγRI, FcγRIII, and FcγRIV, rather than in vitro neutralization. Serial passaging in triple M2e-mAb–treated immunocompetent and immunodeficient hosts failed to generate viral escape mutants. Our findings redefine the influenza-specific antibody therapeutic design and support Fc-optimized, non-neutralizing M2e-mAbs as a broadly effective, mutation-resistant, off-the-shelve therapy with direct relevance to human pandemic preparedness.",

These systems use suspended structures to increase mode overlap and mitigate loss to achieve high efficiency. However, the suspended design’s poor heat dissipation under strong drive limits the ultimate efficiency. Here, we demonstrate an unsuspended optomechanical ring resonator (OMR) based on the silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) platform for microwave-to-optical frequency conversion. The OMR achieves a triply resonant optical-to-optical conversion with an enhanced coupling rateGb= 3.6 gigahertz per square-root milliwatt at a peak conversion efficiency of 1.2% with 3.6-milliwatt microwave drive power and a microwave-to-optical conversion efficiency of 1.5 × 10−5at 10-milliwatt optical drive power. Our results show that the unsuspended SOS platform, which mitigates the thermal effect and is compatible with superconducting qubits, is a promising platform for optomechanical circuitry and quantum transduction.",

Here, based on in vivo CRISPR screen, we identified PTDSS1 as a target to improve anti–PD-1 therapy. Depletion ofPtdss1in tumor cells increased expression of interferon-γ (IFN-γ)–regulated genes, includingB2m,Cxcl9,Cxcl10, andStat1, even in the absence of IFN-γ stimulation in vitro. Loss ofPtdss1in tumor cells also led to increased expression of MHC-I, enhanced cytotoxicity of CD8+T cells, and increased frequency of an iNOS+myeloid subset. A gene signature derived from the iNOS+myeloid cell subset correlated with clinical benefit in patients treated with anti–PD-1 therapy. Moreover, genetic and pharmacological inhibition ofPtdss1in different tumor models improved anti–PD-1 therapy. Together, our results provide insights on a therapeutic strategy for overcoming immunosuppression by inhibiting PTDSS1 and provide rationale for development of a combination immunotherapy strategy composed of PTDSS1 inhibition plus PD-1 blockade.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAcoustic transducers require films that demonstrate both toughness and fatigue resistance, presenting notable challenges when achieved through conventional nanoscale reinforcing strategies. Here, we found that the rib structure of a cicada’s tymbal exhibits exceptional toughness and fatigue resistance, attributed to its unique architecture composed of alternating soft and stiff polymer layers. Inspired by this rib structure, we developed a robust artificial rib film (ARF) using a nanoconfined crystallization strategy that involves the deposition of soft polyethylene oxide and stiff phenol formaldehyde. The ARF demonstrates a toughness amplification factor twice that of the cicada’s tymbal rib and exhibits an exceptionally long fatigue life. The nanoconfined crystallization restricts molecular motion and disperses external forces within the crystalline structure, thereby enhancing its mechanical properties. These improvements enable the ARF to outperform commercial polymer films as an acoustic transducer, achieving 2.7 times increase in frequency response and 2.2 times increase in displacement amplitude.",

Early in chordate evolution, some α subunits acquired an “inserted” (I) domain that expanded integrin’s ligand-binding repertoire but obstructed the ancestral ligand pocket, seemingly blocking conventional integrin activation. Here, we compare cryo–electron microscopy structures of apo and ligand-bound states of the I domain–containing αEβ7integrin and the I domain–lacking α4β7integrin to illuminate how the I domain intrinsically mimics an extrinsic ligand to preserve integrin function. We trace the I domain’s evolutionary origin to an ancestral collagen-collagen interaction domain, identifying an ancient molecular exaptation that facilitated integrin activation immediately upon I domain insertion. Our analyses reveal the evolutionary and biochemical basis of expanded cellular communication in vertebrates.",

    "title": "Observing a robot peer’s failures facilitates students’ classroom learning",
    "abstract": "AbstractAccording to productive failure (PF) theory, experiencing failure during problem-solving can enhance students’ knowledge acquisition in subsequent instruction. However, challenging students with problems beyond their current capabilities may strain their skills, prior knowledge, and emotional well-being. To address this, we designed a social robot–assisted teaching activity in which students observed a robot’s unsuccessful problem-solving attempts, offering a PF-like preparatory effect without requiring direct failure. We conducted two classroom-based studies in a middle school setting to evaluate the method’s effectiveness. In study 1 (N= 135), we compared three instructional methods—observing robot failure (RF), individual problem-solving failure, and direct instruction—in an eighth-grade mathematics lesson. Students in the RF condition showed the greatest gains in conceptual understanding and reported lower social pressure, although no significant differences were found in procedural knowledge or knowledge transfer. Follow-up study 2 (N= 110) further validated the method’s effectiveness in supporting knowledge acquisition after a 2-week robot-involved adaptation phase, when the novelty effect had largely subsided. Students confirmed their perception of the robot as a peer, and they offered positive evaluations of its intelligence and neutral views of its anthropomorphism. Our findings suggest that observing the robot’s failure has a comparable, or even greater, effect on knowledge acquisition than experiencing failure firsthand. These results underscore the value of social robots as peers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education and highlight the potential of integrating robotics with evidence-based teaching strategies to enhance learning outcomes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractReading fluency is a vital building block for developing literacy, yet the best way to practice fluency—reading aloud—can cause anxiety severe enough to inhibit literacy development in ways that can have an adverse effect on students through adulthood. One promising intervention to mitigate oral reading anxiety is to have children read aloud to a robot. Although observations in prior work have suggested that people likely feel more comfortable in the presence of a robot instead of a human, few studies have empirically demonstrated that people feel less anxious performing in front of a robot compared with a human or used objective physiological indicators to identify decreased anxiety. To investigate whether a robotic reading companion could reduce reading anxiety felt by children, we conducted a within-subjects study where children aged 8 to 11 years (n= 52) read aloud to a human and a robot individually while being monitored for physiological responses associated with anxiety. We found that children exhibited fewer physiological indicators of anxiety, specifically vocal jitter and heart rate variability, when reading to the robot compared with reading to a person. This paper provides strong evidence that a robot’s presence has an effect on the anxiety a person experiences while doing a task, offering justification for the use of robots in a wide-reaching array of social interactions that may be anxiety inducing.",

However, achieving true embodied intelligence—which requires continuous environmental sensing, real-time control, and autonomous decision-making—faces challenges in energy management and system integration. We developed deformation-resilient flexible batteries with enhanced performance under magnetic fields inherently present in magnetically actuated soft robots, with capacity retention after 200 cycles improved from 31.3 to 57.3%. These compliant batteries enable large-area deployment of 44.9% across the robot body, and their vertical integration with rationally designed flexible hybrid circuits minimizes additional stiffness while maintaining deformability. This actuator-battery-sensor vertical integration methodology maximizes functional area utilization in a manta ray–inspired soft robot, establishing an untethered platform with sensing, communication, and stable power supply.

    "title": "Interferon-induced senescent CD8+T cells reduce anti-PD1 immunotherapy efficacy in early triple-negative breast cancer",
    "abstract": "AbstractTriple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) lack predictive biomarkers to guide immunotherapy, especially during early-stage disease. To address this issue, we used single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk transcriptomics, and pathology assays on samples from 171 patients with early-stage TNBC receiving chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy. Our investigation identified an enriched subset of interferon (IFN)–induced CD8+T cells in early TNBC samples, which predict immunotherapy nonresponsiveness. Mechanistically, IFN produced by HLA-DR+monocytes triggered cellular senescence in CD8+T cells, which was marked by excessive NAD+consumption, reduced cytotoxicity, and immunotherapy nonresponsiveness. Nicotinamide mononucleotide treatment restored the function of IFN-induced senescent CD8+T cells and enhanced immunotherapy efficacy in patient-derived organoid–T cell coculture and in mouse models. Overall, our study identifies IFN-induced T cell senescence as a driver of immunotherapy nonresponsiveness in early TNBC and provides a strategy to restore CD8+T cell function for immunotherapeutic benefit.",

    "title": "Type I interferon limits central nervous system autoimmunity by modulating the microRNA-21–FOXO1 axis in pathogenic T helper 17 cells",
    "abstract": "AbstractIFN-β, a type I interferon, has been used as a first-line therapy for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) for more than 30 years; however, the cellular and molecular basis of its therapeutic efficacy remains unclear. Here, we first used experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model for MS, to show that the therapeutic effects of IFN-β were associated with a down-regulation of microRNA-21 (miR-21) and pathogenic TH17 (pTH17) cells. In vitro experiments demonstrated that genetic knockout of miR-21 directly inhibited pathogenic TH17 cell differentiation. Further mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-21 promoted pathogenic TH17 differentiation by inhibiting the transcription factorForkhead box protein O1(Foxo1). Accordingly, miR-21 loss abrogated pathogenic TH17 differentiation and conferred resistance to EAE. Treatment of T cell monocultures with IFN-β showed that IFN-β did not directly limit miR-21 expression. Instead, IFN-β treatment inhibited the secretion of miR-21–inducing cytokines from myeloid cells, reduced miR-21 induction within cocultured T cells, and inhibited pathogenic TH17 development. In patient samples, immunophenotypic and targeted transcriptomic analyses revealed that compared with IFN-β treatment responders, nonresponders expressed elevated miR-21–inducing cytokines within myeloid cells, alongside increased miR-21 and pathogenic TH17 cytokines within CD4+T cells. Direct miR-21 inhibition reduced pathogenic TH17 differentiation in nonresponder CD4+T cells. These results suggest that type I IFN signaling limits central nervous system autoimmunity by inhibiting miR-21–mediated pathogenic TH17 development. miR-21 inhibition may be of potential therapeutic value specifically for the IFN-β nonresponder cohort.",

    "title": "Human myelinated brain organoids with integrated microglia as a model for myelin repair and remyelinating therapies",
    "abstract": "AbstractOligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the central nervous system (CNS), are essential for the formation of myelin sheaths and pivotal for maintaining axonal integrity and conduction. Disruption of these cells and the myelin sheaths they produce is a hallmark of demyelinating conditions like multiple sclerosis or those resulting from certain drug side effects, leading to profound neurological impairments. In this study, we created a human brain organoid comprising neurons, astrocytes, and myelinating oligodendrocytes. By integrating induced pluripotent stem cell–derived microglia, we endowed these myelinated human brain organoids (MHBOs) with immune characteristics. MHBOs with microglia (MHBOs +MG) enabled the investigation of demyelination and remyelination—a process in which myelin sheaths are regenerated—in a human context. After toxin-induced demyelination, we observed a reduction in myelin followed by subsequent self-driven remyelination. Proteomic and transcriptomic analyses provided a molecular signature of demyelination and myelin recovery indicating a central role for microglia in the remyelination process. Furthermore, the application of the pro-remyelinating compounds clemastine, XAV939, and BQ3020 further enhanced remyelination in MHBOs +MG but was ineffective in the absence of microglia. Cross-validation of our findings in mouse cerebellar slice cultures confirmed that the pro-remyelinating compounds were effective ex vivo, suggesting the translational potential of our MHBOs +MG model.",

    "title": "A soft robotic device for rapid and self-guided intubation",
    "abstract": "AbstractEndotracheal intubation is a critical medical procedure for protecting a patient’s airway. Current intubation technology requires extensive anatomical knowledge, training, technical skill, and a clear view of the glottic opening. However, all of these may be limited during emergency care for trauma and cardiac arrest outside the hospital, where first-pass failure is nearly 35%. To address this challenge, we designed a soft robotic device to autonomously guide a breathing tube into the trachea with the goal of allowing rapid, repeatable, and safe intubation without the need for extensive training, skill, anatomical knowledge, or a glottic view. During initial device testing with highly trained users in a mannequin and a cadaver, we found a 100% success rate and an average intubation duration of under 8 s. We then conducted a preliminary study comparing the device with video laryngoscopy, in which prehospital medical providers with 5 min of device training intubated cadavers. When using the device, users achieved an 87% first-pass success rate and a 96% overall success rate, requiring an average of 1.1 attempts and 21 s for successful intubation, significantly (P= 0.008) faster than with video laryngoscopy. When using video laryngoscopy, the users achieved a 63% first-pass success rate and a 92% overall success rate, requiring an average of 1.6 attempts and 44 s for successful intubation. This preliminary study offers directions for future clinical studies, the next step in testing a device that could address the critical needs of emergency airway management and help democratize intubation.",

    "title": "Impaired TIM4-mediated efferocytosis by liver macrophages contributes to fibrosis in metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis",
    "abstract": "AbstractHepatocyte apoptosis is a key feature of metabolic dysfunction–associated steatohepatitis (MASH), but the fate of apoptotic hepatocytes in MASH is poorly understood. Here, we explore the hypotheses that clearance of dead hepatocytes by liver macrophages (efferocytosis) is impaired in MASH because of low expression of the efferocytosis receptor T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing 4 (TIM4; geneTimd4) by MASH liver macrophages, which then drives liver fibrosis in MASH. We show that apoptotic hepatocytes accumulate in human and experimental MASH, using mice fed the fructose-palmitate-cholesterol (FPC) diet or the high-fat, choline-deficient amino acid–defined (HF-CDAA) diet. Apoptotic hepatocyte accumulation is associated with impaired efferocytosis and loss of TIM4. Administration of neutralizing anti-TIM4 antibodies or genetic deletion ofTimd4in Kupffer cells of FPC and HF-CDAA diet–fed mice decreased efferocytosis by liver macrophages, increased profibrotic activation of collagen-producing hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), and accelerated the progression to fibrotic MASH. Genetic restoration of macrophageTimd4in FPC and HF-CDAA diet–fed MASH mice or cell therapy with TIM4+macrophages enhanced apoptotic hepatocyte clearance and decreased HSC activation and liver fibrosis. Studies using an ex vivo macrophage HSC cross-talk model and the HF-CDAA MASH model revealed that inactivation of HSCs by efferocytosing macrophages involved macrophage reprogramming to secrete interleukin-10 (IL-10), which activated the IL-10 receptor on HSCs to dampen their profibrotic activation. These findings reveal a key process in the progression from hepatic steatosis to early MASH fibrosis and identify a mechanism-based therapeutic strategy to prevent fibrotic MASH progression.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSkin scars remain a substantial clinical challenge because of their impact on appearance and psychological well-being. Lysyl oxidases catalyze collagen cross-linking, a key factor in scar development. Here, we report a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 1 study to assess the safety and tolerability of PXS-6302, a topical pan–lysyl oxidase inhibitor, in treating mature scars (ACTRN12621001545853). Fifty participants were enrolled across two cohorts: Cohort 1 (open label,n= 8) applied PXS-6302 (2%) daily, and cohort 2 (n= 42) was randomized 1:1 to apply PXS-6302 (2%) or placebo three times per week to a 10-square-centimeter area of scar for 3 months. No severe adverse events (AEs) were reported. Mild to moderate localized skin reactions were the only treatment-related AEs, leading to discontinuation by six participants. Treatment with PXS-6302 three times per week reduced lysyl oxidase activity by 66% and decreased hydroxyproline (a marker for collagen) and total protein concentrations in scar biopsies compared with placebo. Optical coherence tomography showed increased microvessel density and tissue attenuation [a marker of extracellular matrix (ECM) composition] at 3 months compared with the baseline, suggesting ECM remodeling toward unscarred skin architecture. No significant differences in Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) scores were observed between groups after 90 days of treatment once baseline imbalances were accounted for. Together, these data showed that topical pan–lysyl oxidase inhibition was generally well tolerated and altered some measures of the ECM in mature scars, supporting the advancement of this treatment into phase 2 trials.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHuman B cell immunity to the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) stem, a universal vaccine target, is often stereotyped and immunogenetically restricted, posing hurdles to study outside of humans. Here, we show that cynomolgus macaques vaccinated with an HA stem immunogen elicit humanlike public B cell lineages targeting two major conserved sites of vulnerability, the central stem and anchor epitopes. Central stem antibodies were predominantly derived from VH1-138, the macaque homolog of human VH1-69, a VHgene preferentially used in human central stem broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Similarly, macaques produced anchor bnAbs containing the canonical NWP motif. Both bnAb lineages were functionally and structurally analogous to their human counterparts, with recognition mediated largely by germline-encoded structural motifs. These findings indicate that the macaque immunoglobulin repertoire can support humanlike public bnAb responses to influenza HA, highlighting the value of the macaque model for translational vaccinology. Moreover, this underscores the utility of homologous germline-encoded immunity, suggesting that immune repertoires of macaques and humans have been similarly shaped during evolution.",

    "abstract": "AbstractReplication of HIV-1 requires the coordinated action of host and viral transcription factors, most critically the viral transactivator Tat and the host nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). This activity is disrupted in infected cells that are cultured with extracellular vesicles (EVs) present in human semen, suggesting that they contain factors that could inform the development of new therapeutics. Here, we explored the contents of semen-derived EVs (SEVs) from uninfected donors and individuals with HIV-1 and identified host proteins that interacted with HIV Tat and the NF-κB subunit p65. Integrative network and pathway enrichment analyses of these complexes revealed associations with an array of biological functions regulating gene expression. Several proteins in SEVs bound to both Tat and NF-κB p65: the scaffolding and cell signaling regulatory protein AKAP9, the G protein signaling regulator ARHGEF28, the epigenetic reader BRD2, the small nuclear RNA processor INTS1, and the transcription elongation inhibitor NELFB. When complexed with p65, NELFB also interacted with HEXIM1, another transcription elongation inhibitor, suggesting that SEVs may inhibit HIV-1 propagation through multiple networks of transcriptional activation and repression. Exploring these data and the underlying mechanisms may inform the development of more effective or more durable therapeutics against HIV.",

    "title": "Fusobacterium nucleatumenhances amphetamine-induced behavioral responses through a butyrate-driven epigenetic mechanism",
    "abstract": "AbstractAmphetamines are psychostimulants that are commonly used to treat neuropsychiatric disorders and are prone to misuse. The pathogenesis of amphetamine use disorder (AUD) is associated with dysbiosis (an imbalance in the body’s microbiome) and bacterially produced short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are implicated in the gut-brain axis. Amphetamine exposure in both rats and humans increases the amount of intestinalFusobacterium nucleatum, which releases SFCAs. Here, we found that colonization of gnotobioticDrosophila melanogasterwithF. nucleatumor supplementing the flies’ diet with the SCFA butyrate enhanced the psychomotor and reward properties of amphetamine. Butyrate inhibits histone deacetylases (HDACs), and knockdown of HDAC1 recapitulated the effects induced byF. nucleatumor butyrate. The enhancement in amphetamine-induced behaviors was mediated by an increase in the amount of released dopamine that resulted from amphetamine-induced reversal of dopamine transporter (DAT) function, termed nonvesicular dopamine release (NVDR). The magnitude of amphetamine-induced NVDR was partially mediated by an increase in DAT abundance stimulated at a transcriptional level, and the administration ofF. nucleatumor butyrate enhanced NVDR by increasing DAT expression. The findings indicate thatF. nucleatumsupports AUD through epigenetic regulation of dopamine signaling and identify potential targets for AUD treatment.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNaïve T cells are maintained in a homeostatic state to preserve a stable T cell pool with diverse T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires, ensuring preparedness for priming. However, the underlying mechanisms controlling naïve T cell homeostasis and priming remain unclear. Leveraging a machine learning–based functional genetic screen, we identifiedDEAD-box helicase 55(Ddx55) as the top factor responsible for naïve T cell homeostasis. DDX55 was highly expressed in naïve T cells and suppressed enhancer- and promoter-like transposable elements (TEs) near T cell activation–associated genes.Ddx55loss led to derepression of these TEs, resulting in TE-derived R loops and genomic instability, ultimately disrupting naïve T cell homeostasis and abolishing T cell proliferation. Mechanistically, DDX55-targeted TEs harbored myelocytomatosis oncogene (MYC)–binding motifs. DDX55 directly bound MYC and restricted its access to these TE loci, thereby preventing inappropriate TE activation in naïve T cells. Thus, naïve T cells exploit DDX55 as a vital regulator of T cell activation, ensuring their genomic stability and homeostatic maintenance.",

However, the role ofN7-methylguanosine (m7G) modification in macrophages and inflammation remains unexplored. In this study, we observed elevated levels of the methyltransferase METTL1 and m7G modifications in macrophages from mouse and human tissues during acute kidney injury (AKI). METTL1 deficiency in myeloid cells mitigated multiorgan inflammation induced by cecal ligation and puncture and renal ischemia/reperfusion. Genetic deletion of METTL1 inhibited macrophage proinflammatory responses. We identified internalSarm1messenger RNA (mRNA) as a target of m7G modification that controls macrophage metabolic reprogramming. METTL1 deficiency in macrophages inhibited metabolic reprogramming, which was reversed by SARM1 overexpression that induced NAD+decline. Pharmacologically, SA91-0178, a specific METTL1 inhibitor, effectively alleviated tissue injury during septic inflammation. Collectively, our findings suggest that m7G modification enhances the stability ofSarm1mRNA, thereby resulting in NAD+imbalance in macrophages, indicating that METTL1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for systemic inflammation.",

Considering interactions between nervous and immune systems, we examined whether regulatory T (Treg) cells, which suppress systemic and local inflammation, can modulate activation of peripheral neurons. Acute Tregcell “loss of function” increased neuronal activation to noxious stimuli independently of their immunosuppressive function. This activity was mediated by a Tregcell subset capable of production of enkephalins encoded by the genePenk, whose expression is facilitated by combined TCR and glucocorticoid receptor signaling. Punctual selective depletion ofPenk-expressing Tregcells or specific ablation ofPenkin Tregcells increased neuronal activation in response to noxious stimuli and associated inflammation. Our study indicates that a population of tissular Tregcells exhibits neuromodulatory activity to restrain local inflammation in the skin.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAge-related deterioration in bone strength among Western humans has been linked with sedentary lifestyles, but the effect remains debatable. We evaluated aging of diaphyseal strength and cortical bone loss in a European Holocene sample of 1881 adult humeri, femora, and tibiae. Diaphyseal aging did not differ between Early and Late Holocene adults, despite their differences in physical activity. Adult diaphyseal aging was accompanied by the disproportionate rate between a faster increase in the medullary area and an absent or marginal increase in the total area. This indicates that subperiosteal apposition did not fully biomechanically compensate for the medullary expansion. Diaphyseal strength remained unchanged through age in female femora and male diaphyses but declined in female humeri and tibiae. We highlight the importance of postnatal growth to compensate for adult medullary expansion. Diaphyseal aging is critical for the upper limbs, as humeri are more sensitive to aging than femora and tibiae.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMovement is executed through balanced excitation-inhibition in spinal motor circuits. Short-term perturbations in one type of neurotransmission are homeostatically counteracted by the opposing type, but prolonged excitation-inhibition imbalance causes dysfunction at both single neuron and circuit levels. However, whether dysfunction in one or both types of neurotransmission leads to pathogenicity in neurodegenerative diseases characterized by select synaptic deficits is not known. Here, we used functional, morphological, and viral-mediated approaches to uncover the pathogenic contribution of unbalanced excitation-inhibition in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). We show that vulnerable SMA motor circuits fail to respond homeostatically to reduced excitation and instead increase inhibition. This imposes an excessive burden on motor neurons and further restricts their recruitment. Reducing inhibition genetically or pharmacologically improves neuronal function and motor behavior in SMA mice. Thus, the disruption of excitation-inhibition homeostasis is a major maladaptive mechanism that diminishes the capacity of premotor commands to recruit motor neurons and elicit muscle contractions in SMA.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAdvances in brain stimulation have made it possible to target smaller and smaller regions for electromagnetic stimulation, in the hopes of producing increasingly focal neural effects. However, the brain is extensively interconnected, and the neurons comprising those connections may themselves be particularly susceptible to neurostimulation. Here, we test this hypothesis by identifying long-range projections in single-unit recordings from nonhuman primates receiving transcranial alternating current stimulation. We find that putative long-range projections are more strongly affected by stimulation than other cells. Specifically, they are both more entrained on average and account for occurrences of extremely strong entrainment. Given that stimulation appears to target the edges, rather than nodes, of neural networks, it may be necessary to rethink how neurostimulation strategies are designed.",

The Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA) is a key tool for combatting IUU fishing by foreign fleets, requiring standardized inspections, information sharing, and port denial. Using satellite data, we characterized how PSMA has affected high seas vessel behavior and identify opportunities to strengthen its impact. PSMA adoption has increased travel distances to the nearest ports in States not Party to PSMA and channeled more fishing effort to domestic and PSMA Party ports. However, domestic fishing fleets need greater attention because they constituted 66% of port visits in 2021. Among reflagged vessels, we also found a 30% increase in visits to PSMA ports by vessels shifting to domestic flags after PSMA entered into force, allowing them to avoid PSMA requirements for foreign vessels. Our results highlight the centrality of implementing consistent, effective port State measures across foreign and domestic fleets to address IUU fishing risks.",

Here, we explore this question using a coupled climate model. We show that the existence of the North American continent is critical for the intensity of the Asian summer monsoon. The mechanism involves North America acting as an additional heating center, resulting in the strengthening and extension of oceanic advection toward the monsoon region. This is achieved via the Rodwell-Hoskins mechanism that strengthens the North Pacific subtropical high and through a widespread Northern Hemisphere heating that shifts the Hadly circulation subsidence center poleward. This teleconnection is independent of the presence of the Tibetan Plateau, and its impact on East Asian summer precipitation is found to be smaller but comparable to that of Tibet. The individual role of other continents outside Afro-Eurasia is found to be less important.",

More than 800 short-duration seismic events were detected within 28 days along a 150-kilometer profile, indicating widespread ongoing explosive gas release. We suggest that billions of tons of hydrogen gas were produced through serpentinization associated with fluid infiltration via fractures formed by bending of the oceanic plate. Hydrogen was retained in fractures sealed by mud and carbonate. However, hydrogen alone cannot produce the explosive capacity responsible for the formation of pipes. Oxygen released from circulating seawater can be concentrated at crustal depths and then mixed with mantle-derived hydrogen. Explosion of the gas mixture releases large amounts of heat that triggers further explosions of compressed hydrogen gas and results in the formation of hydrothermal pipes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPolyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a ubiquitous polymer with a lack of viable waste management solutions besides mechanical recycling, incineration, and landfilling. Herein, we demonstrate a chemical upcycling of PET waste into materials for CO2capture via aminolysis. The aminolysis reaction products—a bis-aminoamide (BAETA) and oligomers—exhibit high CO2capture capacity up to 3.4 moles per kilogram as a stand-alone organic solid material. BAETA shows strong chemisorption featuring high selectivity for CO2capture from flue gas (5 to 20% CO2) and ambient air (~400 parts per million CO2) under humid conditions. Our thermally stable material (>250°C) enables CO2capture at high temperatures (up to 170°C) for multiple cycles. Scalability of the material production was demonstrated by performing aminolysis of untreated consumer waste PET of 1 kilogram. Our approach introduces a simple and straightforward solution that can address both plastic waste and carbon dioxide, offering a potential pathway toward net negative emissions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) materials offer strong light-matter interaction and design flexibility beyond bulk semiconductors, but an intrinsic limit is the low absorption imposed by the atomic thickness. A long-sought-after goal is to achieve complementary absorption enhancement through energy transfer (ET) to break this limit. However, it is found challenging due to the competing charge transfer (CT) process and lack of resonance in exciton states. Here, we report highly efficient ET in a 2D hybrid organic-inorganic heterostructure (HOIST) of Me-PTCDI/WS2. Resonant ET is observed leading to enhanced WS2photoluminescence (PL) by 124 times. We identify Dexter exchange between the Frenkel state in donor and an excited 2sstate in acceptor as the main ET mechanism, as supported by density functional theory calculations. We further demonstrate ET-enhanced phototransistor devices with enhanced responsivity by nearly 1000 times without sacrificing the response time. Our results expand the understanding of interlayer relaxation processes in 2D materials and open opportunities in optoelectronic devices.",

This work highlights that the strength of electronic correlations in nickel oxide (NiO), a prototypical charge-transfer insulator, can be coherently reduced by tuning the intensity of an optical pulse excitation. This weakening of correlations persists for hundreds of picoseconds and exhibits a recovery time independent of photodoping density across two orders of magnitude. A broadening of the charge-transfer gap is also observed, consistent with dynamical screening. The high degree of control achieved over both the energy and temporal dynamics of electronic correlations offers a promising avenue to a full optical control of correlated systems and the Mott transition.",

However, structural damage caused by top-down fabrication processes remains as a major obstacle that limits device performance. Here, we overcome this bottleneck by demonstrating surface-emitting quasi-BIC lasers fabricated with a bottom-up, etching-free process. We epitaxially grow arrays of crystal phase–engineered InP nanosheets with atomically smooth sidewalls as both the laser active medium and a symmetry-broken quasi-BIC cavity, strategically optimizing coupling between spontaneous emission and the lasing mode. Furthermore, we leverage the dipole selection rule associated with the wurtzite crystal structure of the nanosheets for side mode suppression, achieving single-mode lasing at room temperature with lasing threshold as low as 14 μJ cm−2pulse−1. Optimal light-cavity coupling is evidenced by spontaneous emission factors as high as 0.8, showcasing the potential of bottom-up BIC lasers in realizing near-thresholdless lasing at room temperature.",

However, nowadays optic-encodings, predominantly reliant on light’s intensity and wavelength, are hindered by environmental light interference and limited information capacity. The introduction of unusual polarization states, such as circular polarization—which is absent from ordinary surroundings—holds promise for higher-dimensional interaction. Here, we propose a circularly polarized optical mapper capable of generating high-entropy, noise-resistant keys, serving as a physical interface for unique interaction process between parties. To materialize this mapper, we developed an automated, in situ synthesis platform that facilitates the self-acting fabrication of robust, solid-state, chiral optical spin constrained assemblies. Our mappers, formed by randomized arrays of discrete assemblies, demonstrate near-theoretical performance in uniformity (0.4917), uniqueness (0.4968), and reliability (0.9355). By emitting high-dimensional spin-polarized light, our mappers enable both far-field readout and near-field authentication, with resistance to stray light interference, offering promising applications in the internet of things, augmented reality, and beyond.",

In this work, we accurately replicate the anatomical features and the ganglia adjustments of OSNCEs using lensed plastic optical fibers as artificial ommatidia. As the core part of this work, we implement a spatial approach alongside a temporal approach derived from both hardware and algorithms to accommodate lighting variations of up to 1000 times while still maintaining high image quality such as 180° field of view, minimal distortion, nearly infinite depth of field, and ultrafast motion detection. These adaptive biomimetic features make the OSACE very promising for surveillance, virtual reality, and unmanned aerial vehicles.",

However, a practical strategy that merges bench-stable glycosyl donors with styrenes—a ubiquitous class of synthetic building blocks—remains elusive. Herein, we report a simple and general approach for synthesizing ketonylC-glycosides. The transformation uses designed glycosyl sulfides as air- and moisture-stable precursors to glycosyl radicals, styrenes as aglycone sources, and dimethyl sulfoxide as both an oxidant and solvent, proceeding under photoredox catalysis. Glycosyl radicals are generated from glycosyl sulfides via efficient unimolecular homolytic substitution. This approach obviates harsh conditions for donor activation and the use of activated aglycone precursors, accommodating extensive functional groups and heterocycles. The reaction also exhibits high stereoselectivity across various glycosyl units. Demonstrating synthetic versatility, this method enables efficient access to diverse drug-sugar conjugates and complexC-glycopeptidomimetics. Mechanistic studies reveal key intermediates, suggesting a radical-polar crossover pathway. This study offers a broadly applicable approach to valuable sugar-containing structures.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAntibody-mediated rejection is a leading cause of allograft failure and mortality in pediatric solid organ transplant recipients. Current apheresis systems require large blood volumes and are primarily designed for adults, making them unsuitable for children and small animals. These systems often indiscriminately remove both harmful and protective antibodies, increasing the risk of complications such as life-threatening infections. To address this critical need, we developed acoustofluidic-based system for targeted antibody removal in transplantation (A-START). A-START is engineered to handle small blood volumes and has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical small animal trials. In a sensitized rodent skin transplantation model, A-START only demands 240 microliters of blood, selectively removing donor-specific alloantibodies (DSAs) while preserving protective antibodies, such as tetanus antibodies. A-START retains ~95% of beneficial antibodies and achieves a 60% improvement in DSA removal compared to conventional methods. These findings highlight the transformative potential of A-START as a promising, reliable, scalable solution for improving outcomes in pediatric transplantation and treating antibody-mediated diseases.",

Despite extensive efforts to enhance performance through doping and composite engineering, the mechanisms underlying defect dipole coupling with phase structures remain poorly understood, impeding the advancement of defect-engineered symmetry modulation.

Thepat 200°C (p= 45.4 × 10−4C m−2K−1) rises more than sevenfold compared to poling within the orthorhombic phase (p= 6.5 × 10−4C m−2K−1), representing the highest value reported to date and offering benefit for high-temperature thermal sensing. A dual mechanism is proposed, involving rigid-ion displacement and defect dipole alignment, which respectively contribute to increased displacement charge and space charge. Our findings establish a paradigm for optimizing high-temperature pyroelectrics through a simple, symmetry-confined thermal poling.",

In this study, we show that chiral edge states play a key role in thermoelectric Hall bar measurements by completely controlling the direction of the internal thermal gradient. To this end, we perform measurements of the magnetothermoelectric responses of cadmium arsenide quantum wells. The magnetothermoelectric responses in the quantum Hall regime agree with theoretical predictions if one considers the role of chiral edge states, which flow in opposite directions on either side of the Hall bar and establish an internal temperature gradient that is perpendicular to the externally applied thermal gradient. We show that the results are self-consistent within this picture under different measurement conditions. We discuss potential applications of the findings, such as in nanoscale control of local temperature gradients and thermoelectric effects along with the characterization of other topological systems with chiral edges states.",

This system integrates multidimensional cell sense technology to provide real-time feedback, enabling adaptive fluid dynamics control that robustly compensates for seeding-induced nonlinear fluidic perturbations. Through this closed-loop control, the micromanipulation platform effectively restrains the spatial distribution of multiple cell types, promoting consistent self-assembly. Using this platform, we have successfully achieved programmable organoid manufacturing as well as the construction of assembloids composed of multiple cell types that better mimic mature organ microenvironments.

Here, we confirm a fission event in one zokor species through multiple-omics and functional analyses. We traced this event to a mutation in a splicing enhancer of the DNA repair geneAplfin the fission-bearing species, which caused exon skipping and produced a truncated protein that disrupted DNA repair. An intronic deletion inDna2, known to facilitate neo-telomere formation when knocked out, reduced gene activity. These variants collectively drove chromosomal fission in this zokor species. The newly formed chromosome became fixed due to carrying essential genes and strong selective pressure. While geographic isolation likely initiated the divergence of this species and the sister one, the fission event and associated decline at the chromosome level in gene flow probably exacerbated the speciation process. Our work elucidates the genetic basis of chromosomal fission and underscores its role in speciation dynamics.",

We use computational protein design to generate high affinity binders of BAK and BAX with greater than 100-fold specificity for their target. Both binders activate their targets when at low concentration, driving pore formation, but inhibit membrane permeabilization when in excess. Crystallography shows that the BAK binder induces BAK unfolding, exposing the α6 helix and BH3 domain. Together, these data suggest that upon binding, BAK or BAX unfold; at high binder concentrations, self-association of the partially folded BAK or BAX proteins is blocked and the membrane remains intact, whereas at low concentrations, dimers form, and the membrane ruptures. Our designed binders modulate apoptosis via direct, specific interactions with BAK and BAX and reveal that for therapeutic strategies targeting BAK and BAX, inhibition requires saturating binder concentrations at the site of action.",

Cardiomyocytes sense the mechanical properties of their environment, leading to phenotypic remodeling. A critical component of the ECM mechanosensing machinery, including the protein talin, is organized at the cardiomyocyte costamere. Our previous work indicated a different talin tension, depending on the ECM stiffness, but the effects on downstream signaling remained elusive. Here, we identify that the talin interacting proteins DLC1 (deleted in liver cancer 1), RIAM (Rap1-interacting adaptor molecule), and paxillin each preferentially bind to talin at a specific ECM stiffness, this interaction is preserved in the absence of tension, and the interaction is regulated through focal adhesion kinase signaling. Moreover, DLC1 regulates cardiomyocyte RhoA activity in a stiffness-dependent way, whereby the loss of DLC1 results in myofibrillar disarray. Together, this study demonstrates a mechanism of imprinting mechanical information into the talin interactome to fine-tune RhoA activity, with impacts on cardiac health and disease.",

We show that MI transporters are highly conserved across birds and that dietary MI reduces fat accumulation in Anna’s hummingbirds. MI consumption by hummingbirds varies with seasonal changes in body mass, consistent with a regulatory role. Furthermore, MI enhances fatty acid oxidation in avian cells, via effects on pyruvate-dehydrogenase complexes, indicating a role in mitochondrial fuel selection.

However, adverse events (e.g., chorioretinal atrophy) have been reported in many patients receiving subretinal injection of Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl) and experimental gene therapies. Subretinal injection confines transduction to the treated area. To address this, we manufactured high-concentration fibrin hydrogels encapsulating AAV2–green fluorescent protein (AAV2-GFP). Gels had homogeneous AAV distribution, desired mechanical properties, and retained infectivity. Epiretinal placement of fibrin–AAV2-GFP(n= 11) was compared to subretinal (n= 5) and intravitreal AAV2-GFPinjection (n= 3). The subretinal group exhibited inconsistent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) transduction restricted to the injection region with severe atrophy in two cases. The intravitreal group had weak transduction and inflammation. In contrast, epiretinal hydrogels degraded within days and led to broad transduction of RPE without atrophy or inflammation. This technology could advance gene therapy for retinal degenerations and other ocular or systemic disorders.",

PTPN22 regulates T cell receptor (TCR) signaling through dephosphorylation of the kinases lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) and zeta-chain–associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70). The regulation of PTPN22 remains poorly understood. Here, we identify PTPN22 Ser449as a protein kinase A phosphorylation site, which is triggered by TCR engagement and is hyperphosphorylated in lupus peripheral blood cells. PTPN22 Ser449phosphorylation selectively lowered the affinity of PTPN22 for ZAP70 versus LCK but also indirectly suppressed inhibitory LCK Tyr192phosphorylation through a ZAP70-CD45 signaling axis. The resulting dephosphorylation of LCK Tyr192not only enhanced TCR signaling but also modulated pathway activation downstream the TCR. In vivo loss of PTPN22 Ser449phosphorylation reduced T cell responses and suppressed experimental lupus nephritis. These results suggest that PTPN22 Ser449phosphorylation promotes a CD45-mediated retrograde ZAP70-LCK feedback loop that enhances T cell responses and promotes autoimmunity.",

    "title": "TaGW2-TaVOZ1 module regulates wheat salt tolerance via both E3 ligase–dependent and –independent pathways",
    "abstract": "AbstractWheat production is limited by the rapid expansion of salinized arable land worldwide. Identification of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the salt stress response is of great importance. Here, we uncovered the NAC-type transcription factor, TaVOZ1, as a positive regulator of wheat salt tolerance. Its overexpression could enhance yield and biomass production under salt stress, whileTaVOZ1knockdown attenuates salt tolerance. TaVOZ1 transcriptionally activates stress-responsive genes, especiallyHKT1-family transporters, decreasing shoot Na+accumulation. However, the RING-type E3 ligase, TaGW2, directly interacts with and ubiquitinates TaVOZ1, promoting its ubiquitin/26Sproteasomal degradation.TaGW2overexpression reduces salt tolerance, while its knockdown or knockout enhances wheat response to salt stress. Moreover, we found a moonlight function of TaGW2 wherein it binds the same DNA motifs as TaVOZ1 to block its up-regulation ofHKT1-family genes while coordinately governing both the salt tolerance and grain yield. This study highlights the functional versatility of TaGW2 and defines an antagonistic TaGW2-TaVOZ1 regulatory module in wheat salt tolerance.",

    "title": "Uridine as a potentiator of aminoglycosides through activation of carbohydrate transporters",
    "abstract": "AbstractAminoglycosides (AGs) are broad-spectrum antibiotics effective against Gram-negative bacteria, with uptake dependent on membrane potential. However, the mechanisms of AG entry remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify a previously undescribed uptake pathway via carbohydrate transporters inE. coli. By deleting or overexpressing 26 carbohydrate transporters, we found that 18 facilitated AG uptake, a mechanism conserved across several Gram-negative ESKAPEE pathogens. Using fluorescent-labeled AGs and flow cytometry, we quantified differential uptake. To enhance AG efficacy, we screened 198 carbon sources for their ability to induce transporter expression using acmtA-gfpfusion. Uridine emerged as a strong inducer ofcmtAand 12 additional AG-importing transporters. Coadministration of uridine considerably improved AG efficacy against clinical and resistantE. colistrains by enhancing drug uptake. This combination also improved outcomes in human blood ex vivo and in a murine urinary tract infection model. Given uridine’s clinical safety, it holds promise as an adjuvant to potentiate AG treatment against multidrug-resistant infections.",

    "title": "HIV-1 manipulates CD96 on CD4+T cells to subvert antiviral immunity",
    "abstract": "AbstractHIV-1 evades immune responses by modulating plasma membrane receptors. Using a flow cytometry–based screening, we profiled 332 surface receptors on HIV-1–infected primary CD4+T cells and identified 23 down-regulated receptors, including known targets such as CD4, MHCI, CCR7, and CD62L. CD96, an inhibitory natural killer (NK) cell receptor poorly studied in human CD4+T cells, was markedly down-regulated. This modulation, mediated by the viral proteins Nef and Vpu, surpassed that of other NK-associated receptors such as CD155 and NTB-A and is conserved across lentiviruses. CD96HiCD4+T cells exhibited a proinflammatory TH1/TH17 phenotype characterized by IFN-γ and IL-17 secretion and displayed impaired migration in vivo. Furthermore, CD96 ligation enhanced IFN-γ release upon viral peptide stimulation and promoted the secretion of TH1/TH17-associated cytokines. Our findings suggest that CD96 regulates antiviral immune responses and maintains proinflammatory properties in CD4+T cells. Thus, its down-regulation represents a previously unknown HIV-1 immune evasion strategy, with implications for exploiting CD96 as immunotherapeutic target.",

    "title": "Cotranslational protein folding through non-native structural intermediates",
    "abstract": "AbstractCotranslational protein folding follows a distinct pathway shaped by the vectorial emergence of the peptide and spatial constraints of the ribosome exit tunnel. Variations in translation rhythm can cause misfolding linked to disease; however, predicting cotranslational folding pathways remains challenging. Here, we computationally predict and experimentally validate a vectorial hierarchy of folding resolved at the atomistic level, where early intermediates are stabilized through non-native hydrophobic interactions before rearranging into the native-like fold. Disrupting these interactions destabilizes intermediates and impairs folding. The chaperone trigger factor alters the cotranslational folding pathway by keeping the nascent peptide dynamic until the full domain emerges. Our results highlight an unexpected role of surface-exposed residues in protein folding on the ribosome and provide tools to improve folding prediction and protein design.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSomatically acquired mitochondrial DNA mutations accumulate with age, but the mechanisms and consequences are poorly understood. Here we show that transient injuries induce a burst of persistent mtDNA mutations that impair resilience to future injuries. mtDNA mutations suppressed energy-intensive nucleotide metabolism. Repletion of adenosine, but not other nucleotides, restored ATP generation, which required a nuclear-encoded purine biosynthetic enzyme, adenylate kinase 4 (AK4). Analysis of 369,912 UK Biobank participants revealed a graded association between mutation burden and chronic kidney disease severity as well as an independent increase in the risk of future acute kidney injury events (p < 10−7). Heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations may therefore reflect the cumulative effect of acute injuries to metabolically active cells, impairing major functions in a fashion amenable to nuclear-controlled purine biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe global burden of kidney disease displays marked sexual dimorphism. Lineage tracing and single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed that starting from puberty, estrogen signaling in female mice supports self-renewal and differentiation of renal progenitors to increase filtration capacity, reducing sensitivity to glomerular injury compared with that of males. This phenomenon accelerated as female kidneys adapted to the workload of pregnancy. Deletion of estrogen receptor α in renal progenitors disrupted this adaptation, leading to preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and increased maternal risk of hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Offspring from affected mothers had fewer nephrons, resulting in early-life hypertension and greater susceptibility to kidney disease. These results highlight the fundamental role of kidney fitness and renal progenitors for pregnancy and preeclampsia and as a determinant of sexual dimorphism in kidney disease.",

Neutrophils, which are recruited in high numbers to the ischemic myocardium, promote these arrhythmias. Comparing neutrophils with macrophages, we found that resistin-like molecule γ (Retnlgor RELMγ) was the most differentially expressed gene in mouse infarcts. RELMγ is part of a pore-forming protein family that defends the host against bacteria by perforating their membranes. In mice with acute infarcts, leukocyte-specificRetnlgdeletion reduced ventricular tachycardia. RELMγ elicited membrane defects that allowed cell exclusion dyes to enter the cardiomyocyte interior and also caused delayed afterdepolarizations and later cardiomyocyte death, both of which are strong arrhythmogenic triggers. Human resistin likewise attacked membranes of liposomes and mammalian cells. We describe how misdirected innate immune defense produces membrane leaks and ventricular arrhythmia.",

    "abstract": "AbstractProducing olefins by carbon dioxide (CO2) hydrogenation is a long-standing goal. The usual products are multicarbon mixtures because the critical step of heterolytic hydrogen (H2) dissociation at high temperatures complicates selectivity control. In this study, we report that irradiating gold–titanium dioxide at 365 nanometers induces heterolytic H2dissociation at ambient temperature. This process likely relies on interfacial electric dipoles from photogenerated electrons and holes situated on the metallic gold nanoparticles and interfacial gold–oxygen–titanium scaffolds. The heterolytic H2dissociation is further promoted by light-induced coating of gold nanoparticles with a titanium oxide layer. The resulting nucleophilic hydrogen species reduce CO2to ethane in >99% yield under light irradiation in a flow apparatus. Furthermore, cascading with a subsequent photocatalytic ethane dehydrogenation generates ethylene in >99% yield over 1500 hours of irradiation.",

    "title": "Epithelial tension controls intestinal cell extrusion",
    "abstract": "AbstractCell extrusion is essential for homeostatic self-renewal of the intestinal epithelium. Extrusion is thought to be triggered by crowding-induced compression of cells at the intestinal villus tip. In this study, we found instead that a local “tug-of-war” competition between contractile cells regulated extrusion in the intestinal epithelium. We combined quantitative live microscopy, optogenetic induction of tissue tension, genetic perturbation of myosin II activity, and local disruption of the basal cortex in mouse intestines and intestinal organoids. These approaches revealed that a dynamic actomyosin network generates tension throughout the intestinal villi, including the villus tip region. Mechanically weak cells unable to maintain this tension underwent extrusion. Thus, epithelial barrier integrity depends on intercellular mechanics.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe unguis (hoof, claw, or nail) of the first digit (D1, also known as the thumb or pollex) of the tetrapod hand exhibits numerous functional adaptations, but its macroevolutionary association with ecological diversity is unknown. Across Rodentia, we find that most extant genera and ancestral lineages bear D1 nails. Exceptions follow structure-function associations that arose independently multiple times, specifically, the gain of D1 claws with subterranean habits and the loss of D1 ungues with oral-only feeding behavior. We hypothesize that early acquisition of D1 nails and manually dexterous food handling was crucial for rodents to adaptively leverage cranial specializations for efficient gnawing and thereby exploit hard seeds and nuts, a niche that they dominated after the extinction of multituberculates. Our study recasts ideas about rodent evolution and uncovers a previously unrecognized contributor to their successful radiation.",

In this work, we showed in a cohort of 56.5 million individuals across the United States that fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure raises LBD risk. Mechanistically, we found that PM2.5exposure led to brain atrophy in wild-type mice, an effect not seen in α-synuclein (αSyn)–deficient mice. PM2.5exposure generated a highly pathogenic αSyn strain, PM2.5–induced preformed fibril (PM-PFF), with enhanced proteinase K resistance and neurotoxicity, resembling αSyn LBD strains. PM2.5samples from China, the United States, and Europe consistently induced proteinase-resistant αSyn strains and in vivo pathology. Transcriptomic analyses revealed shared responses between PM2.5-exposed mice and LBD patients, underscoring PM2.5’s role in LBD and stressing the need for interventions to reduce air pollution and its associated neurological disease burden.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPressures from human activities are expected to increase significantly, impacting marine ecosystems globally. To plan for a sustainable future, we need to forecast distributions of cumulative impacts from multiple pressures. Here we mapped (10km resolution) future cumulative impacts of ten climate, land-based, fishing and other pressures on twenty marine habitats under two climate scenarios at midcentury (~2050). We found cumulative impacts are projected to increase 2.2 to 2.6 times globally, with coastal habitats facing higher impacts but offshore regions facing faster increases, especially in equatorial regions. Furthermore, many countries dependent on marine resources will have large increases in impacts. Incorporating these results into strategic policy and management will support more sustainable use and protection of marine ecosystems and the services provided to people.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn compositionally complex materials, there is controversy on the effect of enthalpy versus entropy on the structure and short-range ordering in so-called high-entropy materials. To help address this controversy, we synthesized and probed 40 M4AlC3layered carbide phases containing two to nine metals and found that short-range ordering from enthalpy was present until the entropy increased enough to achieve complete disordering of the transition metals in their atomic planes. We transformed all of these layered carbide phases into two-dimensional (2D) sheets and showed the effects of the order versus disorder on their surface properties and electronic behavior. This study suggests the key effect that the competition between enthalpy and entropy has on short-range order in multicompositional materials.",

Using interferometric synthetic aperture radar and local geodetic and seismic data, we show that the 1000-kilometer-distant, February 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquakes in southeastern Türkiye triggered deformation and/or eruption at 56 mud volcanoes and centimeter-scale aseismic slip on seven faults over tens of kilometers within the fluid-rich Kura Basin in the West Caspian region. This transient deformation event, with an equivalent moment magnitude of 6.1, was coupled with local inflation below major hydrocarbon fields. We postulate that seismic waves led to a change in pore pressure at depth, which in turn triggered aseismic slip along several crustal faults crossing the basin and its surroundings.",

    "abstract": "AbstractReducing charge carrier transport losses, improving selectivity, and minimizing non-radiative recombination are essential for enhancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. We used a hybrid two-step perovskite deposition method that is compatible with industry-standard textured silicon, incorporating a perovskite surface treatment based on 1,3-diaminopropane dihydroiodide. The interaction of this molecule with the perovskite surface increased the majority charge carrier concentration at the electron-selective contact, which reduced interfacial recombination. Simultaneously, this field-effect passivation increased the electron concentration across the entire intrinsic perovskite absorber, which increased conductivity and reduced transport losses. Combined, this yields high-performance, fully-textured perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, achieving a 1-sun AM1.5G conversion efficiency of 33.1% with an open-circuit voltage of 2.01 volts, and an extended outdoor stability in the Red Sea Coast.",

Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase subgroup XII (LRR-RLK-XII) represents one of the largest PRR families owing to lineage-specific diversification. Through bioinformatics and synthetic biology approaches, we characterized LRR-RLK-XIIs from 285 plant species and identified a receptor, “SCORE,” that perceives cold shock protein (CSP) peptides. SCORE orthologs from multiple angiosperm lineages exhibit CSP recognition polymorphisms, indicating recurrent selection for pathogen recognition through substitutions at key amino acid residues. Through functional phylogenomics and protein structure predictions, we engineered SCORE variants capable of detecting multiple phytopathogen CSP peptides, thus revealing the diverse PRR recognition landscape in plants. Our strategy holds promise for engineering plant immune receptors, particularly for perennial crops.",

We electrochemically synthesized chiral ferromagnetic cobalt-iron nanohelices from nanoparticles in anodized aluminum oxide templates. The spiral directions and the number of strands were regulated by incorporating chiral molecules and applying an appropriate potential.

    "title": "Tandem sustainability",
    "abstract": "AbstractEthylene is the world’s most produced organic chemical, underpinning industries worth trillions (1). This hydrocarbon compound is a key building block for manufacturing fuels, plastics, fertilizers, and pharmaceuticals. Ethylene is primarily derived from fossil fuels through steam cracking, a high-temperature process that removes hydrogen atoms from molecules or breaks down large molecules into smaller ones. This requires an energy-intensive cryogenic distillation to separate ethylene from a complex gas mixture, which consumes substantial energy and resources (2). Thus, a more selective and energy-efficient route to ethylene production is desired. On page 1037 of this issue, Jinet al.(3) report that light can unlock a fundamentally different mode of catalytic control for ethylene production, yielding >99% selectivity. This could offer an attractive way to obtain renewable ethylene that is often three to nine times more expensive to generate than fossil-derived ethylene through existing methods (4).",

    "title": "Do inhibitory interneurons encode information or just keep the rhythm?",
    "abstract": "AbstractOne of the key ambitions for systems neuroscience is to understand how the activity of different neurons gives rise to the array of cognitive functions and behaviors seen throughout the animal kingdom. The essential building blocks of any neural circuit are glutamatergic excitatory and γ-aminobutyric acid–producing (GABA-ergic) inhibitory neurons, which interact to support cognitive processes such as sensation, perception, decision-making, memory, and spatial navigation. Excitatory neurons are typically seen as the cells encoding information within the brain, and inhibitory neurons as modulating information flow or providing the temporal coordination underlying brain rhythms. However, on page 994 of this issue, Valeroet al.(1) report findings that challenge this model by suggesting that interneurons do indeed contribute to encoding of spatial information in the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe mammalian innate immune system has evolved over millions of years as a first line of defense against pathogens and tissue injury. But what emerges when immunity encounters the syndromes of advanced age, wherein the selective evolutionary pressure is relatively short? In the case of human heart disease, the confrontation can lead to unintended and grave consequences. On page 1043 of this issue, Kumowskiet al. (1) report that in mice, misdirected cross-talk between neutrophils and cardiac tissue predisposes the heart to arrhythmia and cardiac death and can inflict damage beyond the heart. Antimicrobial peptides normally released by neutrophils to fight infection damage the cell membrane of cardiomyocytes, causing ion leaks that disrupt the heart’s electrical activity. These peptides may offer a new target for limiting tissue injury and death from ischemic heart disease.",

    "abstract": "AbstractUse of drones has increased considerably over the past decade, reshaping activities as diverse as warfare, entertainment, delivery services, and disease control. One of the most consequential uses of drones—in agriculture—has taken off globally within only the past 5 years. This is upending expectations and may help to reconcile a fundamental sustainability dilemma—how to produce more food by using fewer inputs—but is also inducing trade-offs. This rapid change has been largely unnoticed by researchers outside of the specialized technical worlds of aeronautical engineering and precision agriculture. Little academic attention has been paid to the use of agricultural drones beyond the laboratory or trial plot. Evidence of the extent and effects of drones’ real-world use is partial and fragmentary. We explored evidence and hypotheses about global agricultural drone diffusion and its implications for sustainability and set out an agenda for future policy and science.",

    "title": "Optogenetic neuromuscular actuation of a miniature electronic biohybrid robot",
    "abstract": "AbstractNeuronal control of skeletal muscle function is ubiquitous across species for locomotion and doing work. In particular, emergent behaviors of neurons in biohybrid neuromuscular systems can advance bioinspired locomotion research. Although recent studies have demonstrated that chemical or optogenetic stimulation of neurons can control muscular actuation through the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the correlation between neuronal activities and resulting modulation in the muscle responses is less understood, hindering the engineering of high-level functional biohybrid systems. Here, we developed NMJ-based biohybrid crawling robots with optogenetic mouse motor neurons, skeletal muscles, 3D-printed hydrogel scaffolds, and integrated onboard wireless micro–light-emitting diode (μLED)–based optoelectronics. We investigated the coupling of the light stimulation and neuromuscular actuation through power spectral density (PSD) analysis. We verified the modulation of the mechanical functionality of the robot depending on the frequency of the optical stimulation to the neural tissue. We demonstrated continued muscle contraction up to 20 minutes after a 1-minute-long pulsed 2-hertz optical stimulation of the neural tissue. Furthermore, the robots were shown to maintain their mechanical functionality for more than 2 weeks. This study provides insights into reliable neuronal control with optoelectronics, supporting advancements in neuronal modulation, biohybrid intelligence, and automation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn recent years, a growing number of publications have reported the presence of microbial species in human tumors and mixtures of microbes that appear to be highly specific to different cancer types. Our recent reanalysis of data from three cancer types revealed that technical errors have caused erroneous reports of numerous microbial species found in sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. Here, we have expanded our analysis to cover all 5734 whole-genome sequencing (WGS) datasets currently available from TCGA, covering 25 distinct types of cancer. We analyzed the microbial content using updated computational methods and databases and compared our results to those from two major recent studies that focused on bacteria, viruses, and fungi in cancer. Our results expand upon and reinforce our recent findings, which show that the presence of microbes is far smaller than had been previously reported and that many species identified in TCGA data might not be present at all. As part of this expanded analysis and to help others avoid being misled by flawed data, we have released a dataset that contains detailed read counts for bacteria, viruses, archaea, and fungi detected in all 5734 TCGA samples, which can serve as a public reference for future investigations.",

    "title": "Dengue disease severity in humans is augmented by waning Japanese encephalitis virus immunity",
    "abstract": "AbstractOwing to increased global movement, vector-spread permissive climate change, and increased vaccination coverage against certain flaviviruses, the likelihood of being exposed to multiple flaviviruses in a lifetime has increased. Although many Asian countries have routine vaccination campaigns against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), the effect of JEV immunity on dengue disease severity is largely unknown. Here, we aimed to understand the effect of preexisting immunity against JEV on subsequent dengue disease outcomes in a prospective human cohort in Nepal, which has a high prevalence of JEV immunity and rapidly rising dengue virus (DENV) infections. A cohort consisting of 546 participants was studied over three dengue seasons and 5 years. Chymase, a serum biomarker of severe dengue across multiple patient cohorts, was assessed alongside clinical outcomes to determine whether there were associations between JEV immunity and dengue severity. We observed that midrange neutralizing antibody titers, approximately a 1:160 serum dilution capable of inhibiting JEV, were associated with heightened biomarkers of dengue disease severity and warning signs of severe disease in this cohort of patients who were mostly experiencing primary dengue infections. These results suggest that waning immunity to JEV could enhance the severity of dengue disease. This highlights the potential of maintaining strong immunity to JEV through vaccine boosters, not only to maintain protection against JEV in endemic regions but also to limit the potential of antibody-mediated enhancement of dengue disease.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAntibody discovery is crucial for developing therapeutics and vaccines and for understanding adaptive immunity. However, the lack of approaches to synthesize antibodies with defined sequences in a high-throughput manner represents a major bottleneck in antibody discovery. Here, we present oPool+display, a high-throughput cell-free platform that combined oligo pool synthesis and mRNA display to rapidly construct and characterize hundreds to thousands of natively paired antibodies in parallel. As a proof of concept, we applied oPool+display to probe the binding specificity of more than 300 uncommon influenza hemagglutinin-specific antibodies against nine hemagglutinin variants through 16 screens. More than 5000 binding tests were performed in 3 to 5 days of hands-on time with further scaling potential. Follow-up structural and functional analysis of two antibodies revealed the versatility of the human immunoglobulin gene segment D3-3 (IGHD-3-3) in recognizing the hemagglutinin stem. Overall, this study established an experimental platform that not only accelerates antibody characterization but also enables unbiased discovery of recurring molecular signatures among antibodies with the same specificity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractKRASis among the most frequently mutated oncogenes in cancer, and for decades, efforts at pharmacological blockade of its function in solid cancers have been unsuccessful. A notable advance in this endeavor is the recent development of small-molecule KRAS inhibitors, which enable direct targeting of the mutant oncoprotein. Here, we comprehensively evaluated the preclinical efficacy of BI-2493, a first-in-class allele-agnostic mutant-KRAS inhibitor (panKRASi), in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We report effective tumor growth suppression across a broad range of models, including cell lines, patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), and syngeneic orthotopic models, and prolonged survival in genetically engineered mouse models. Overall, transcriptomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic profiling of panKRASi-treated models confirmed RAS pathway inhibition along with up-regulation of LKB1/AMPK (liver kinase B1/AMP-activated protein kinase) targets. In panKRASi-treated immune-replete models, we observed increased intratumoral CD8+effector T cells and decreased infiltration of myeloid cells, along with remodeling of the tumor microenvironment (TME), enabling responses to immune checkpoint blockade. In the long term, emergence of resistance to panKRASi monotherapy was associated with increased YAP signaling within tumor cells and enhanced expression of immune checkpoints in the TME that impede effective T cell function. Our multifaceted approach identified potential combinatorial approaches for generating sustained responses to panKRASi.",

    "title": "Inhibiting SLC38A2 lowers blood pressure in rodent models of hypertension",
    "abstract": "AbstractHypertension remains a major global health burden with limited effective treatment options. In the present study, the sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter SLC38A2 was identified as a regulator of blood pressure (BP) through modulating endothelial nitric oxide (NO) signaling. Here, we show that mice with global and endothelial cell (EC)–specificSlc38a2gene knockout (Slc38a2△EC) exhibited reduced blood pressure compared with wild-type controls. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed enhanced NO biosynthesis in the ECs of theSlc38a2△ECmice. Blockade of endothelial SLC38A2 by its inhibitor methylaminoisobutyric acid (MeAIB) increased NO production through activating the protein kinase B (AKT)–endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) pathway by inhibiting EC uptake of glutamine. Moreover, MeAIB lowered blood pressure in both high-salt and deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)–induced hypertensive mouse and rat models. Last, in two independent population cohorts including a Chinese cohort established by our group and a European cohort from the UK Biobank, theSLC38A2rs1873793 variant was associated with increased risk of hypertension under a recessive model. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that targeting SLC38A2 may represent a therapeutic target for the treatment of hypertension.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe rapid emergence of divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants led to a 2023–2024 update of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine to a monovalent version containing the XBB.1.5 SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen. To determine the durability and breadth of the antibody responses after immunization, we analyzed antibodies and memory B cells from 24 individuals before and after a single XBB.1.5 mRNA vaccine dose for up to 6 months. Using a live virus neutralization assay, we found that the XBB.1.5 vaccine improved the magnitude and breadth of antibody neutralizing activity against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain (WA1), BA.5 strain, and XBB.1.5 Omicron variants. Durable WA1 and XBB.1.5 IgG spike protein binding antibodies were induced with an estimated half-life of 703 and 531 days (at day 120), respectively. There was a greater increase of IgG1 and IgG4 binding antibodies against the XBB.1.5 spike protein compared with the WA1 spike protein postvaccination. A high proportion of antibodies were cross-reactive against both WA1 and XBB.1.5 strains, as determined by serum depletion and memory B cell analysis, and this cross-reactivity was durable. Last, we evaluated the neutralizing activity of these antibodies against more contemporary circulating Omicron strains and observed reduced cross-reactivity to KP.2 and KP.3 compared with XBB.1.5 6 months after vaccination. These data show that the XBB.1.5 COVID-19 vaccine promotes more durable binding and neutralizing antibodies than prior ancestral WA1 or bivalent vaccines. However, divergent Omicron variants with mutations in the spike protein were able to evade these neutralizing antibodies, emphasizing the need for periodic consideration of COVID-19 vaccine reformulation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIntercellular cross-talk is essential for the adaptation capabilities of populations of cells. While direct diffusion-driven cell-to-cell exchanges are difficult to map, current nanotechnology enables one to probe single-cell exchanges with the medium. We introduce a mathematical method to reconstruct the dynamic unfolding of intercellular exchange networks from these data, applying it to an experimental coculture system. The exchange network, initially dense, progressively fragments into small disconnected clusters. To explain these dynamics, we develop a maximum-entropy multicellular metabolic model with diffusion-driven exchanges. The model predicts a transition from a dense network to a sparse one as nutrient consumption shifts. We characterize this crossover both numerically, revealing a power-law decay in the cluster-size distribution, and analytically, by connecting to percolation theory. Comparison with data suggests that populations evolve toward the sparse phase by remaining near the crossover. These findings offer insights into the collective organization driving the adaptive dynamics of cell populations.",

While Spanish colonists brought horses to the Caribbean decades earlier, settlement of the English colony at Jamestown, Virginia, was among the first dispersals of horses to the eastern seaboard. Archaeozoological analysis of identifiable domestic equid remains from two contexts associated with the initial occupation of Jamestown demonstrates intense processing and consumption of the first Jamestown horses during the “Starving Time” winter of 1609. Osteological and biomolecular study of these equid remains demonstrates their successful reproduction at the colony and use in transport activities and identifies an adult domestic donkey with mixed European and West African ancestry, possibly supplied through undocumented exchange during a transatlantic stopover. These results reveal the challenges of equid translocation in early settlement of eastern North America and the global connectivity of early transatlantic animal exchange.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNeuronal connectivity in the circadian clock network is essential for robust endogenous timekeeping. In theDrosophilacircadian clock network, the small ventral lateral neurons (sLNvs) serve as critical pacemakers. Peptidergic communication mediated by the neuropeptidePigment Dispersing Factor(PDF), released by sLNvs, has been well characterized. In contrast, little is known about the role of the synaptic connections that sLNvs form with downstream neurons. Connectomic analyses revealed that the sLNvs form strong synaptic connections with previously uncharacterized neurons called superior lateral protocerebrum 316 (SLP316). Here, we show that silencing the synaptic output from the SLP316 neurons via tetanus toxin expression shortened the free-running period, whereas hyperexciting them by expressing the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel resulted in period lengthening. Under light-dark cycles, silencing SLP316 neurons caused lower daytime activity and higher daytime sleep. Our results reveal that the main postsynaptic partners of keyDrosophilapacemaker neurons are a nonclock neuronal cell type that regulates the timing of sleep and activity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPath integration, the ability to track one’s position using self-motion cues, is critically dependent on the grid cell network in the entorhinal cortex, a region vulnerable to early Alzheimer’s disease pathology. In this study, we examined path integration performance in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD), a group at increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease, and healthy controls using an immersive virtual reality task. We developed a Bayesian computational model to decompose path integration errors into distinct components. SCD participants exhibited significantly higher path integration error, primarily driven by increased memory leak, while other modeling-derived error sources, such as velocity gain, sensory, and reporting noise, remained comparable across groups. Our findings suggest that path integration deficits, specifically memory leak, may serve as an early marker of neurodegeneration in SCD and highlight the potential of self-motion–based navigation tasks for detecting presymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease–related cognitive changes.",

    "title": "Volcanic emission of reduced sulfur species shaped the climate of early Mars",
    "abstract": "AbstractSulfur and other volatiles could be transported from the martian interior to surface through magmatic processes, including mantle melting, magma differentiation, and degassing. However, these processes were not fully integrated in past sulfur cycling models because of complexity from the gas-melt interactions in chemically and dynamically evolving magmatic systems with multicomponent volatiles. Here, we incorporate these processes to simulate how sulfur, carbon, and hydrogen degas from martian melts. We find that reduced sulfur species, H2S and S2, are dominantly emitted through degassing at crustal to surficial pressures. These sulfur species could condense as sulfide and elemental sulfur, potentially yielding the sulfate deposits observed on the martian surface through secondary oxidation. Our models also show that evolved magmas reach graphite and sulfide saturation at crustal pressures and thus may establish sulfur and carbon reservoirs in the martian crust. The degassed H2S and S2may form a hazy atmosphere with SF6, a potent greenhouse gas, to shape the paleoclimate of Mars.",

Many non-native marine taxa are not documented until after they have become invasive, leaving questions about invasion timing (first introduction and lag period), geographic origin, vectors and pathways, and cause(s) of success. Foraminifera, unicellular, calcareous-shelled eukaryotes, offer a unique way of analyzing past ecosystem structure because their fossilized shells provide a window into the past, and small size and abundance enable us to document distribution over time in core samples. We use records of Foraminifera to document the timing and history of establishment of an invasive species (Ammonia confertitesta) in Long Island Sound, east of New York City (USA).A. confertitestawas rare from the mid-19th century but did not proliferate until the mid-1970s. We hypothesize that increasing propagule pressure from the rapid increase in global ship traffic and ballast water was the main factor for its success.",

    "title": "Dynamic deep marine oxygenation during the Early and Middle Paleozoic",
    "abstract": "AbstractThe Early Paleozoic radiation of diverse animal life is commonly connected to a well-ventilated global ocean. Yet the oxygenation history of Paleozoic deep oceans remains debated. Using thallium (Tl) isotope ratios in deep-marine mudrocks, we reconstruct the history of deep marine oxygenation from ~485 to 380 million years ago. Thallium isotopes can track bottom water oxygenation indirectly through their sensitivity to seafloor Mn oxide burial. We apply Tl isotopes to a global set of mudrocks, placing a particular focus on the Road River Group of Yukon, Canada. Our data reveal an oscillatory pattern in seawater Tl isotope ratios and, in turn, a dynamic ocean ventilation history. A long-lived deep ocean oxygenation episode is identified between ~405 and 386 million years ago. These short-term dynamics are superimposed on a muted positive ocean oxygenation trend over the entire Early and Middle Paleozoic. Sustained O2accumulation in global marine bottom waters occurred sometime after ~380 million years ago according to our dataset.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHigh-precision, Sagnac interferometry has long been proposed as a route to test fundamental questions in physics such as the magnitude of relativistic precessions (e.g., the Lense-Thirring effect). Although many elaborate experiments have been performed using, for example, matter wave interferometry or even quantum entanglement, none are within six orders of magnitude of the sensitivity and stability required to achieve such a measurement. We report on the operation of a free space ring laser gyroscope over a period of 250 days under an ambient pressure stabilizing vessel continuously in an unperturbed underground laboratory. Because we measure relative to local inertial space, the precession and nutation motion of Earth’s axis are intrinsically contained in the observations. It is demonstrated that optical interferometry, using an ultrastable cavity, yields an accuracy limit for rotation sensing of 48 parts per billion (i.e., picoradians per second), less than an order of magnitude away from the regime in which relativistic effects can be measured.",

    "abstract": "AbstractYear-to-year variance of agricultural productivity is an important determinant of food security. Previous global analyses described increased yield volatility from warming, but it has become increasingly clear that changes in water availability are also a key determinant of yields. Here, we provide the first global quantification of climate change impacts on maize, soybean, and sorghum yield variance due to changes in temperature and soil moisture. Pairing an empirical crop model with CMIP6 simulations indicates that changes in temperature and soil moisture increase interannual weather-induced yield variance by7to19%°Cacross crops. This increase is driven roughly equally by previously quantified increased temperature stress variance, as well as by increased covariance between temperature and soil moisture stresses. Results using a simple land surface model are consistent with those using CMIP6 simulations in indicating that this increased covariance is driven by warmer air more quickly drying soils and by dry soils promoting greater warming.",

However, no experiment using different target materials has observed a dark matter signal consistent with their result. To address this puzzle, the COSINE-100 collaboration conducted a model-independent test using sodium iodide crystal detectors, the same target material as DAMA/LIBRA. Analyzing data collected over 6.4 years by the effective mass of 61.3 kilograms, with improved energy calibration and time-dependent background modeling, we found no evidence of an annual modulation signal, challenging the DAMA/LIBRA result with a confidence level greater than 3σ. This finding represents a substantial step toward resolving the long-standing debate surrounding DAMA/LIBRA’s dark matter claim, indicating that the observed modulation is unlikely to be caused by dark matter interactions.",

The THM-TENG protector exhibits tunable stiffness (40 to 4300 newtons per millimeter), ~70% impact energy absorption, and achieves a specific energy absorption of ~0.25 joules per gram at a weight of only 10 grams. Through triboelectrification, the protector converts mechanical energy into electrical signals, enabling real-time monitoring of impact loads up to 1000 newtons (≤5 hertz). Integrated with a microcontroller unit, wireless transmission, and alarm systems, THM-TENG demonstrates dual functionality in UAVs: mitigating vibration while providing real-time force monitoring, positioning, and early warning, all without external power sources. This work establishes a transformative framework for lightweight, multifunctional protective systems with applications in aerospace, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTopological superconductors are one of the intriguing material groups from the viewpoint of not only condensed matter physics but also industrial applications such as quantum computers based on Majorana fermion. For real applications, developments of thin-film topological superconductors are highly desirable. Bi/Ni bilayer is a possible candidate for thin-film chiral superconductors where the time-reversal symmetry is broken. Here we report the phase shift of resistance oscillations by half flux quantum in a ring-shaped device of epitaxial Bi/Ni bilayer induced by a small magnetic field through the ring. The half quantum fluxoid can be decisive evidence for unconventional superconductors where the superconducting order parameter has an internal degree of freedom. The present result provides a functional operating principle for quantum devices where the phase of the supercurrent can be shifted byπwith a small magnetic field, based on the internal degree of freedom had by topological superconductivity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe human visual system’s real-time focus-tunable imaging capability has inspired curved imaging system development. However, curved image sensors mimicking the human retina typically lack tunable curvature to match the curved Petzval surface throughout the focus-tunable range. Here, we propose a focus-tunable real-time curved imaging system based on a tunable-curvature perovskite curved image sensor. Using parylene C film for waterproofing and encapsulation, the ultrathin perovskite curved image sensor with the hierarchical mesh design is demonstrated, which conforms to spherical surfaces of different radii while maintaining mechanical stability during deformation. The image sensor exhibits low detection limit (10 nanowatts per square centimeter) and long-term stable dynamic photoresponse. Combining the image sensor with a tunable lens achieves clear images at different distances via simultaneously adjusting both sensor and lens radii. Furthermore, through integrating image sensor with a readout matrix and wireless data collection component, the real-time imaging system is demonstrated with real-time focus-tunable imaging capabilities.",

In CDW materials, carrier density substantially influences the ground state, typically altered through foreign ion doping and investigated at macro- or mesoscopic scales via photoemission or transport techniques. However, atomic-scale visualization, particularly in doped CDW systems without foreign ions, remains rare. Here, we present real-space observation of doping-tunable granular charge ordering using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) in semiconducting single-layer Cr2Se3, a group VIB transition metal chalcogenide (TMC). Observations of lattice distortion, bandgap modulation atEF, and STM contrast inversion at low temperatures indicate a charge ordering origin. Cr2Se3’s semiconducting nature enables charge ordering modulation through doping: Hole doping suppresses it, whereas electron doping alters the pattern, yielding a periodic 3√3 × 3√3 CDW phase. This tunable charge ordering in a group VIB TMC advances the understanding of charge doping and ordering interactions in two-dimensional materials.",

The order-disorder transition has been recognized as playing a critical role; however, the precise nature of the order parameter still remains under scrutiny, including the local dipole direction and the correlations above and below the Curie temperature. Using in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy, we directly map polar displacements in BaTiO3across the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition, providing atomistic insights into an order-disorder mechanism. Atomic tracking reveals finite polar Ti displacements in the paraelectric phase where they manifest as random polar nanoregions. The displacements align along <111> direction in both the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. The paraelectric-ferroelectric transition emerges from real-space correlations of the <111> polar Ti displacements. Our direct visualizations provide atomic insights into the order-disorder mechanism in the ferroelectric-paraelectric transition of BaTiO3.",

Advances in flexible electronics offer possibilities for wearable monitoring of tissue stiffness. However, existing technologies often rely on tethered setups or require frequent calibration, restricting their use in ambulatory environments. This study introduces a mechano-acoustic wave sensing technology for automated, wireless elastography. The patch-form sensor maintains conformal contact with the skin, regardless of body motion or deformation. It provides continuous, depth-sensitive estimation of subcutaneous tissue stiffness through real-time surface wave dispersion analysis. Theoretical and experimental investigations on phantom materials and tissues spanning a wide range of Young’s modulus (in kilopascals to megapascals) demonstrate the capability of the device to rapidly and robustly evaluate the stiffness at depths up to several centimeters. The device shows compatibility with various tissue models, with results consistent with in-parallel ultrasound elastography measurements. Deployment of the device during exercises confirms its viability for ambulatory monitoring, enabling continuous assessment of variation in tissue stiffness.",

The intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance enables both structural and functional assessment during operation, permitting interactive adaptation to tissue deformation and avoidance of critical anatomical regions. Here, we report an MRI-guided robotic system for stereotactic neurointervention. A macro-micro hybrid pneumatic-hydraulic actuated stereotactic robot with a large range of motion and high precision is developed. This is coupled with a compact bioinspired soft actuator for target intervention. A global-focal MRI sequence is proposed for interactive navigation, closed-loop control, and precise targeting. Validation is performed with phantom, cadaveric, and in vivo animal studies, showing positional accuracies of 0.39, 0.68, and 0.14 millimeters, respectively, demonstrating superior performance compared to the current state of the art in robotic-assisted stereotactic neurointervention.",

Understanding contact-mediated electron transfer dynamics in RACs offers insights into physical contact events in colloidal suspensions and enables quantification of electrical energy transport in nonconjugated polymers. Redox-based electron transport was directly observed in monolayers of micron-sized RACs containing ethyl-viologen side groups via fluorescence microscopy through an unexpected nonlinear electrofluorochromism that is quantitatively coupled to the redox state of the colloid. Via imaging studies, using this electrofluorochromism, the apparent charge transfer diffusion coefficientDCTof the RAC was easily determined. The visualization of energy transport within suspensions of redox-active colloids was also demonstrated. Our work elucidates fundamental mechanisms of energy transport in colloidal systems, informs the development of next-generation redox flow batteries, and may inspire new designs of smart active soft matter including conductive polymers for applications ranging from electrochemical sensors and organic electronics to colloidal robotics.",

Differentiation therapy, aiming to mature CSCs and MDSCs, shows great promise. However, its efficacy is hindered by limited accessibility in hypoxic deep tumor regions. Inspired by the apoptotic body (ApoBD)–mediated deep tumor penetration, we design a pulsatile sequential drug release system with a core-shell structure. The reversible acid-responsive shell protonates and swells in lysosomes to release doxorubicin, inducing lysosomal escape and cell apoptosis. In ApoBDs, it deprotonates and contracts to prevent excessive drug release. After deep penetration via ApoBDs, the hypoxia-responsive core releases all-trans retinoic acid to reverse CSCs and MDSCs, overcoming chemoresistance and modulating the immuno-microenvironment. This strategy targets the heterogeneous distribution of CSCs and MDSCs in solid tumors, enhancing chemo-intervention and immune checkpoint blockade therapy while presenting encouraging potential for cascade deep tumor penetration and differentiation therapy.",

Galectin-3 (Gal-3) has been previously implicated in ABP of epithelial cells, and, here, we find that it is apically expressed in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) during neural induction. Gal-3 blockade disrupts ABP and alters the distribution of junctional proteins in hESC-derived neural rosettes and is rescued by addition of recombinant Gal-3. Transcriptomics analysis shows that blocking Gal-3 regulates expression of genes responsible for nervous system development and cell junction assembly, among others. Last, Gal-3 blockade during embryonic development in vivo reduces horizontal cell divisions, disturbs cortical layering of neural progenitors, and induces gyrification. These data uncover a regulatory mechanism for ABP in the brain and warrant caution in modulating Gal-3 during pregnancy.",

TBXT’s regulatory network is poorly understood, and strategies to disrupt its activity for therapeutic purposes are lacking. We developed designed ankyrin repeat proteins that block TBXT-DNA binding (T-DARPins). In chordoma cells, T-DARPins reduced cell cycle progression, spheroid formation, and tumor growth in mice and induced signs of senescence and differentiation. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses identified gene networks involved in cell cycle regulation, embryonic cell identity, and interferon response and revealed features of regulome components, such as susceptibility to pharmacologic inhibition and the fine-tuning of TBXT downstream effectors through IGFBP3. Finally, we found high interferon signaling in chordoma cell lines and patient tumors, which was promoted by TBXT and associated with sensitivity to JAK2 inhibitors. These findings demonstrate the potential of DARPins for probing nuclear proteins to understand the regulatory networks of transcription factor–driven cancers, including entry points for therapies that warrant testing in patients.",

The transformable, self-assembling nanoplatform specifically accumulates in the inflamed joint cavity guided by a vascular targeting peptide (STP). Subsequently, STP detaches and undergoes shape transformation, forming nanofibers on the vascular endothelium, which serve as a rapid-acting physical barrier in the short term and facilitate sustained vascular normalization in the long term. Concurrently, the remaining nanoparticles undergo charge reversal and RGD exposure, enabling precise delivery of anti-RA agent triptolide and the immunomodulatory agent metformin. Collectively, this study provides a potent strategy for rapid, sustained, and precise spatiotemporal remodeling of RA using a simple yet intelligent self-assembling nanoplatform.",

Ca2+ions stabilize both the SdrD complex and the mechanically robust SdrD B-domains, which exhibit unprecedented folding strength. In the context of atopic dermatitis (AD), disrupted calcium gradients amplify SdrD interactions, which could potentially intensifyS. aureusvirulence.

Accordingly, we evaluated the effects of long-term/low-dose Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) supplementation in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)–infected, ART-treated rhesus macaques (RMs). THC significantly increased plasma/jejunum serotonin and indole-3-propionate, enhancing gut-brain communication through up-regulation of serotonin receptors (HTR4/HTR7) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) signaling via a cannabinoid receptor (CBR)-2–mediated mechanism. Furthermore, THC enriched cholesterol-metabolizingOscillibacterand reduced plasma cholesterol and toxic secondary bile acids (SBAs), thus improving cholesterol and SBA homeostasis. Furthermore, THC increased β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels via a CBR1-mediated mechanism, suggesting enhanced hepatic fatty acid oxidation for metabolic and cardiovascular health. THC restored ART/SIV-induced elevation of pro-inflammatory and cardiotoxic long-chain acylcholines to preinfection levels. THC-treated RMs maintained viral suppression despite reduced plasma ART levels, suggesting diminished ART-related toxicity.

Under opposing forces, kinetochores move bidirectionally along these walls while remaining near the ends, yet how continuous wall sliding occurs without end detachment remains unclear. Using ultrafast force-clamp spectroscopy, we show that single Ndc80 complexes, the primary microtubule-binding kinetochore component, exhibit processive, bidirectional sliding. Plus end–directed forces induce a mobile catch bond in Ndc80, increasing frictional resistance and restricting sliding toward the tip. Conversely, forces pulling Ndc80 away from the plus end trigger mobile slip-bond behavior, facilitating sliding. This dual behavior arises from force-dependent modulation of the Nuf2 calponin-homology domain’s microtubule binding, identifying this subunit as a friction regulator. We propose that Ndc80’s ability to modulate sliding friction provides the mechanistic basis for the kinetochore’s end coupling, enabling its slip-clutch behavior.",

    "abstract": "AbstractADP-ribosylation can occur as mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) or be extended into poly-ADP-ribose (PAR). Tankyrase, a PAR transferase, adds PAR to itself and other proteins targeting them for proteasomal degradation via the PAR-binding E3 ligase RNF146. This degradation can be counteracted by RING-UIM E3 ligases RNF114 and RNF166, although the process is unclear. Here, we identify a mechanism that can regulate the balance between MAR and PAR on tankyrase to control degradation. We show that Deltex E3 ligases DTX2 and DTX3 catalyze monoubiquitylation of tankyrase in cells. This ubiquitylation occurs, not on a (canonical) lysine, but rather on MAR, creating a monoubiquitin-MAR hybrid mark. RNF114 and RNF166 recognize this mark using a unique hybrid reader domain and further diubiquitylate it. This ubiquitylation of MAR, which occurs near the ADP-ribose addition site, prevents PAR formation, antagonizing the action of the PAR-binding E3 ligase RNF146 and stabilizing tankyrase. These findings reveal an interplay between ubiquitin, ADP-ribose, and E3 ligases in cellular signaling.",

Cryo–electron microscopy of the capsid (2.1 angstroms) and portal-tail complex (1.9 angstroms) reveals an unambiguous phage particle with T7-like morphology. Characterizing the host range of this phage, we make a serendipitous finding that links the acquisition of a phage defense mechanism to the formation of a virulent clade ofL. pneumophilaresponsible for 80% of all Legionnaires’ disease.",

    "title": "HSF2 drives breast cancer progression by acting as a stage-specific switch between proliferation and invasion",
    "abstract": "AbstractBreast cancer is hallmarked by phenotypic transitions enabling abnormal cell proliferation and invasion. The stress-protective transcription factor heat shock factor 2 (HSF2) is associated with cancer, but its function in breast carcinogenesis remains poorly understood. Analysis of human breast tumor samples and mouse in vivo xenografts uncovered that HSF2 expression and activity undergo dynamic changes as a function of tumor progression. HSF2 expression, nuclear localization, and coexpression with the proliferation marker Ki67 are increased in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), suggesting that HSF2 designates hyperplastic cells underlying tumor expansion. In mouse xenografts, HSF2 localization switches from nuclear to cytoplasmic upon DCIS-to-invasive transition. Using cell-based models, we identify canonical transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) signaling as the molecular mechanism regulating HSF2. TGF-β–mediated down-regulation of HSF2 allowed acquisition of an invasive cell phenotype, which was counteracted by ectopic HSF2. Together, we propose that HSF2 acts as a stage-specific switch between proliferation and invasion in breast cancer.",

    "title": "The TaCEP15 peptide signaling cascade modulates primary root length and drought tolerance in wheat",
    "abstract": "AbstractDrought stress poses an environmental challenge affecting crop yield. Small signaling peptides play crucial roles in the regulation of stress responses in plants. Here, we unveil that the TaCEP15 peptide interacts with the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase TaCEPRL. Knockout ofTaCEP15orTaCEPRLincreases primary root length and enhances drought tolerance in wheat. TaCEPRL interacts with and phosphorylates TaSnRK1α, leading to the degradation of TaSnRK1α. The presence of TaCEP15 intensifies the phosphorylation and degradation of TaSnRK1α. Consistently, overexpressingTaSnRK1α boosts primary root elongation and augments drought tolerance. In addition, we identify the transcription factor TabZIP9, which binds to theTaCEP15promoter and suppresses its transcription. A-to-T substitution in theTaCEP15promoter decreases the binding affinity of TabZIP9. As expected, transgenic plants withTabZIP9knockout or overexpression exhibit noteworthy changes in primary root length and drought tolerance. Our findings shed light on the importance of the peptide signaling pathway in regulating primary root length and responding to drought stress in wheat.",

    "title": "An ancient and essential miRNA family controls cellular interaction pathways inC. elegans",
    "abstract": "AbstractThe transition from unicellular to multicellular life required the acquisition of coordinated and regulated cellular behaviors, including adhesion and migration. In metazoans, this involves adhesion proteins, signaling systems, and an elaborate extracellular matrix (ECM) that contributes to adhesion and signaling interactions. Innovations that enabled complex multicellularity occurred through new genes in these pathways, novel functions for existing genes, and regulatory changes. Gene regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) expanded with multicellularity. A single miRNA, miR-100, arose in the last common eumetazoan ancestor and is widely conserved across animals. We reveal the molecular function of itsC. eleganshomolog, the miR-51 family. This family acts in a dose-dependent manner to control morphogenesis by regulating several genes involved in cell signaling, adhesion, and migration, including ECM modifiers—specifically heparan sulfate sulfotransferases (HSTs). Some of these targets are also predicted to be conserved targets across vertebrates. Our work suggests that this miRNA provided an innovation in the regulation of cellular interactions early in metazoan evolution.",

    "abstract": "AbstractOncomicrobes are estimated to cause 15% of cancers worldwide. When cancer whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data are collected, the microbes present are also sequenced, allowing the investigation of potential etiological and clinical associations. Interrogating the microbial community for 8908 patients encompassing 22 cancer types from the Genomics England WGS dataset revealed that only colorectal tumors exhibited unmistakably distinct microbial communities that can reliably be used to distinguish anatomical site [positive predictive value (PPV) = 0.95]. This pattern was validated in two independent datasets. Potential clinical relevance uncovered by our analyses included accurate detection of alphapapillomaviruses [human papillomavirus (HPV)] in oral cancers, when compared with current clinical standards, and the detection of rare, highly pathogenic viruses such as human T-lymphotropic virus–1. Biomarker investigations demonstrated statistically significant associations (P< 0.05) between a subset of anaerobic bacteria and survival in certain subtypes of sarcoma. Our results contradict previous claims that each cancer type has a distinct microbiological signature but highlight the potential value of microbial analysis for certain cancers as WGS of tumor samples becomes common in the clinic.",

    "title": "Gαqsignaling in primary sensory neurons shifts opioid analgesia to NMDA receptor–driven tolerance and hyperalgesia",
    "abstract": "AbstractOpioids relieve pain by activating μ-opioid receptors (MORs), which inhibit communication between pain-sensing neurons (nociceptors) and the spinal cord. However, prolonged opioid use can paradoxically lead to increased pain sensitivity (hyperalgesia) and reduced analgesic efficacy (tolerance), partly because of the activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) at the central terminals of primary sensory neurons in the spinal cord. Here, we identified a critical role for the G protein Gαqin this paradox. Pharmacological inhibition of Gαqin rats reversed morphine-induced increases in NMDAR phosphorylation, synaptic trafficking, and activity at sensory neuron terminals and reduced morphine-induced excitatory nociceptive input to spinal dorsal horn neurons. Morphine enhanced Gαqcoupling specifically to metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) dimers in the spinal cord. Furthermore, targeted knockdown of Gαqin dorsal root ganglion neurons in mice normalized NMDAR-related changes and prevented NMDAR-mediated synaptic potentiation triggered by MOR activation. In addition, either pharmacological or genetic disruption of Gαqsignaling enhanced morphine’s analgesic effects while reducing hyperalgesia and tolerance. These findings reveal that Gαqsignaling contributes to opioid-induced NMDAR hyperactivity at nociceptor central terminals by promoting MOR-mGluR5 cross-talk. Targeting this pathway may improve the safety and efficacy of opioid-based pain management.",

    "abstract": "AbstractInBRAF-mutant melanoma cells treated with inhibitors of the kinases BRAF and MEK, a subset of cells rapidly and nongenetically adapts to escape drug-induced quiescence and reenters the cell cycle. Here, we investigated the mechanisms enabling this drug escape by computationally reconstructing single-cell lineages from time-lapse imaging data, linking dynamic signaling pathways to distinct cell-cycle fate outcomes. We found that reactivation of the MEK substrate ERK was necessary but not sufficient to drive escape; rather, the activity of the protein complex mTORC1 was also required to promote cell growth and protein synthesis in drug-treated cells destined for cell-cycle reentry. ERK and mTORC1 signaling converged to increase the abundance of cyclin D1 protein, a critical bottleneck for cell-cycle commitment under drug pressure. In cells in which endogenous cyclin D1 was fluorescently tagged using CRISPR, the subset that escaped drug treatment exhibited marked accumulation of cyclin D1 at least 15 hours before cell-cycle reentry, enabling early prediction of future drug escape. Cyclin D1 thus represents both an early biomarker and potential therapeutic target for suppressing drug escape in melanoma. We observed a similar mTORC1-driven mechanism underlying escape in lung cancer cells, but not colon cancer cells, highlighting partial generalizability across cancer types.",

We longitudinally compared homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 vaccination, focusing on cytokine-responsive innate-like lymphocytes—mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells and Vδ2+γδ T cells—which sense and tune innate-adaptive cross-talk. Ad priming elicited robust type I interferon (IFN)–mediated innate-like T cell activation, augmenting T cell responses (innate-to-adaptive signaling), which was dampened at boost by antivector immunity. Conversely, mRNA boosting enhanced innate-like responses, driven by prime-induced spike-specific memory T cell–derived IFN-γ (adaptive-to-innate signaling). Extending the dosing interval dampened inflammation at boost because of waning T cell memory. In a separate vaccine trial, preboost spike-specific T cells predicted severe mRNA reactogenicity regardless of the priming platform or interval. Overall, bidirectional innate-like and adaptive cross-talk, and IFN-γ–licensed innate-like T cells, orchestrate interval-dependent early vaccine responses, suggesting modifiable targets for safer, more effective regimens.",

Our findings revealed broad functional and clonal heterogeneity in T cells generated by vaccination or infection, including multiple distinct effector populations. T cell function was largely conserved between COVID-19 vaccine platforms but was distinct compared with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, the dosing interval greatly influenced the quality of T cells after two vaccine doses, particularly after mRNA-LNP vaccination, where a longer interval led to reduced inflammatory signaling and increased secondary proliferation. These insights enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2–specific T cells and inform the optimization of mRNA vaccination regimens.",

Septal adipose tissue macrophages (sATMs), marked by CD209b and lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1, were long-lived and positioned in close proximity to adipocyte stem cells (ASCs) within the WAT septum. Within this shared niche, sATMs instructed the differentiation of ASCs into white adipocytes through transforming growth factor–β1 (TGFβ1). Depletion of sATMs, or the selective loss of TGFβ1 within tissue-resident macrophages, redirected ASC fate toward thermogenic adipocytes, enhancing WAT beiging and protecting against diet-induced obesity.

    "title": "Land availability and policy commitments limit global climate mitigation from forestation",
    "abstract": "AbstractForestation (afforestation and reforestation) could mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon within biomass and soils. However, global mitigation from forestation remains uncertain owing to varying estimates of carbon sequestration rates (notably in soil) and land availability. In this study, we developed global maps of soil carbon change that reveal carbon gains and losses with forestation, primarily in the topsoil. Constraining land availability to avoid unintended albedo-induced warming and safeguard water and biodiversity (389 million hectares available for forestation globally) would sequester 39.9 petagrams of carbon by 2050, substantially below previous estimates. This estimate drops to 12.5 petagrams of carbon with land further limited to existing policy commitments (120 million hectares). Achieving greater mitigation requires expanding dedicated forestation areas and strengthening commitments from nations with considerable but untapped potential.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHigh-resolution electronic tactile displays stand to transform haptics for remote machine operation, virtual reality, and digital information access for people who are blind or visually impaired. Yet, increasing the resolution of these displays requires increasing the number of individually addressable actuators while simultaneously reducing their total surface area, power consumption, and weight, challenges most evidently reflected in the dearth of affordable multiline braille displays. Blending principles from soft robotics, microfluidics, and nonlinear mechanics, we introduce a 10-dot–by–10-dot array of 2-millimeter-diameter, combustion-powered, eversible soft actuators that individually rise in 0.24 milliseconds to repeatably produce display patterns. Our rubber architecture is hermetically sealed and demonstrates resistance to liquid and dirt ingress. We demonstrate complete actuation cycles in an untethered tactile display prototype. Our platform technology extends the capabilities of tactile displays to environments that are inaccessible to traditional actuation modalities.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPemphigus vulgaris is a B cell–mediated autoimmune disease characterized by autoantibodies targeting desmoglein-3 (Dsg3), a critical adhesion molecule in epithelial tissues. Current treatments rely on broad immunosuppression, highlighting the need for more targeted therapeutic approaches in pemphigus vulgaris and other autoantibody-driven disorders. We engineered a therapeutic fusion protein consisting of the pathogenic domains of Dsg3 linked to either human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) or mouse IgG2a (Dsg3-Fc). In vitro, Dsg3-Fc selectively eliminated Dsg3-autoreactive B cells. In vivo, Dsg3-Fc effectively depleted human B cells expressing patient-derived anti-Dsg3 B cell receptors, even in the presence of circulating autoantibodies. Moreover, Dsg3-Fc inhibited both disease initiation and progression in a polyclonal, active pemphigus vulgaris model in immunocompetent mice. In addition, Dsg3-Fc rapidly neutralized pathogenic autoantibodies without inducing systemic toxicity. These findings demonstrate that targeting pathogenic B cells and neutralizing autoantibodies through autoantigen-Fc fusion proteins may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for pemphigus vulgaris and potentially other autoantibody-mediated diseases without the need for global immunosuppression.",

    "title": "Dietary saturated fatty acids promote lung myeloid cell inflammasome activation and IL-1β–mediated inflammation in mice and humans",
    "abstract": "AbstractResident tissue macrophages and monocytes (RTMs) integrate local and systemic signals to coordinate immune cell function at homeostasis and in response to inflammatory stimuli. Obesity-associated metabolic dysfunction drives the development of RTM populations that contribute to disease states in multiple tissues. However, the contribution of specific dietary components to innate immune cell activation and function, as opposed to the direct effects of obesity, is largely unknown. Here, we studied the mechanisms by which high-fat (HF) diets shape lung RTM phenotype and function at steady state and influence responses to inflammatory insults. We found that, during HF diet feeding, lung RTMs accumulate saturated long-chain fatty acids, specifically stearic acid (SA), and demonstrate features of NLRP3 inflammasome priming and activation. In vivo, increased dietary SA was sufficient to cause neutrophil-predominant lung inflammation in the steady state and exacerbate a model of innate airway inflammation, whereas increased dietary oleic acid, the monounsaturated counterpart of SA, was sufficient to reduce inflammasome activation in the steady state and attenuate airway inflammation. Depletion of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) or pharmacologic inhibition of the endonuclease inositol requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) protected against SA-induced exacerbated lung inflammation. Last, we identified a population of lung monocytes with hallmarks of HF diet–induced RTM activation that were present in samples from obese humans with asthma. Together, these results identify a class of dietary lipids that regulate lung RTM phenotype and function in the steady state and modulate the severity of inflammation in the lung.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWorldwide, more than 4 million patients with end-stage kidney disease require hemodialysis through an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). AVFs fail because of venous neointimal hyperplasia (VNH) resulting in venous stenosis formation. A phase 1 randomized trial in patients undergoing upper extremity AVF placement was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of autologous adipose–derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in improving AVF function. The mechanism of action by which MSCs exert their beneficial effects was investigated using AVFs created in mice and pigs treated with allogenic MSCs and xenotransplant using patient MSCs in CD1-Foxn1numice. At a median follow-up of 42 months, patients with MSC-treated AVFs had reduced time to maturation with an increase in the vein diameter compared with controls. AVFs treated with allogenic MSCs in mice and pigs had an increase in M2- and M1-like macrophages with a decrease in VNH. Transcriptomic analysis of AVFs treated with allogenic MSCs in mouse and MSC xenotransplants of patients with successful AVFs showed decreased peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma (Pparγ) and leptin receptor (Lepr) and increased latent transforming growth factor–beta–binding protein 2 (Ltbp2). PPARγ was reduced in CD68 (+) cells from successful AVFs and allogenic MSC-treated mouse AVFs. Venous stenosis and VNH formation were mitigated in AVFs of mice withPparγ ablation in immune cells. Conditioned medium from MSCs of responders versus nonresponders had decreased proinflammatory genes, senescence-associated proteins, and monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation induced by phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate. Periadventitial delivery of MSCs to AVFs promoted positive vascular remodeling through decreased inflammatory responses.",

    "title": "NF1-depleted ER+breast cancers are differentially sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitors",
    "abstract": "AbstractNeurofibromin/NF1 is a RAS (rat sarcoma virus) GTPase-activating protein and estrogen receptor (ER) transcriptional corepressor. NF1lowstatus, identified by copy number loss or low mRNA/protein expression, is associated with endocrine therapy resistance in ~20% of ER+/HER2−(human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) early-stage breast cancers. The identification of targeted treatments for NF1lowER+/HER2−breast cancer is therefore a priority. In this study, proteogenomic analysis of ER+/HER2−breast cancer demonstrated that NF1lowtumors exhibited elevated cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) activity. In cell lines,NF1deletion had a dual effect on CDK4 activity: first, by promoting ER recruitment toCCND1(cyclin D1), thereby increasing CDK4–cyclin D1 complex formation, and second, by activating C-RAF (rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma), which drove phosphorylation of the CDK4 activation loop. Preclinical modeling demonstrated that NF1lowER+cancer cells were more sensitive to fulvestrant combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor versus fulvestrant alone, with the induction of cell death in vitro and durable tumor regressions in ER+NF1lowpatient-derived xenograft models in vivo. Furthermore, NF1lowER+/HER2−tumors were more sensitive to neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) plus palbociclib than to neoadjuvant AI alone, as indicated by suppression of mRNA-based proliferation scores. These data are consistent with a model whereby ER and RAS coactivation upon NF1 loss can drive CDK4/6 activity and endocrine therapy resistance but renders NF1lowER+tumors susceptible to CDK4/6 inhibition. Development of clinical-grade NF1 diagnostics should be prioritized to determine whether NF1lowER+breast cancers should receive adjusted adjuvant treatment recommendations that reflect increased responsiveness to CDK4/6 inhibition.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDespite the well-described association of skin lesions withStaphylococcus aureus, the distinct ability of clinical isolates to influence the local and systemic inflammatory response in a patient-specific manner is insufficiently characterized. In this study, we analyzed clinical recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), which is characterized by wounds chronically colonized withS. aureus, to explore the relationship between inflammatory immune response and strain diversity. Children with RDEB (moderate phenotype,n= 5; severe phenotype,n= 10) and controls (n= 18) were enrolled in the study. Profiling of plasma proteins (n= 800), immune cells (n= 30 subsets and cytokine-producing cells), and cytokines (n= 38) identified a specific inflammatory signature in severe disease. Furthermore, patients with severe RDEB presented a high frequency of interleukin-17A+ (IL-17A+) cells among CD4+ and mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) lymphocytes. PositiveS. aureuscultures from the skin of patients with RDEB allowed whole-genome sequencing of patient strains and assessment of primary keratinocyte immune response upon bacterial challenge.S. aureussecretome and conditioned medium from keratinocytes challenged withS. aureusstrains from patients with severe but not from those with moderate RDEB promoted strong activation and a pro–IL-17 response in both CD4+ and MAIT cells. Our findings show thatS. aureusstrains isolated from patients with severe RDEB induce an IL-17–skewed immune response and pave the way for precision microbiology to explain and predict the highly variable virulence potential of bacterial clinical isolates.",

    "title": "Resolving fibrosis by stimulating HSC-dependent extracellular matrix degradation",
    "abstract": "AbstractTissue fibrosis arises from a critical imbalance between the production and breakdown of extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Whereas current strategies predominantly focus on curbing ECM production, the possibility of promoting ECM degradation to resolve fibrosis remains largely untapped. The role of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in ECM degradation is an intriguing area for investigation. We previously demonstrated that inhibiting acid ceramidase (aCDase) increases ceramide in HSCs to ameliorate hepatic fibrosis. Here, we uncover a key signaling pathway that promotes ECM degradation in primary human HSCs, which is dependent upon the activation of protein kinase Cα (PKCα) and the induction of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) through extracellular signal–regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Genetic reduction and pharmacological inhibition with a small molecule reduced aCDase activity, leading to increased collagen degradation and hepatic fibrosis resolution in the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and fructose, palmitate, cholesterol, and trans-fat (FPC) mouse models. Consistently, ceramide signaling correlated with ECM remodeling and degradation in patients with metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease. The findings show that ceramide regulates ECM degradation and establish aCDase as a target for therapeutic regression of fibrosis.",

    "title": "Follicular regulatory T cells promote experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by supporting B cell egress from germinal centers",
    "abstract": "AbstractFollicular regulatory T cells (Tfrcells) constitute a subset of regulatory T cells pivotal to the immune response in germinal centers (GCs) that inhibit autoantibody production. Their role, however, remains ill-defined in autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) and its murine model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which are neuroinflammatory diseases driven by T and B cells. Here, we quantified peripheral blood immune subpopulations in two cohorts of patients with MS and found higher circulating Tfrcell frequencies in patients in relapse compared with patients in remission. To examine the functional role of Tfrcells in autoimmune neuroinflammation, we used EAE mouse models and showed that Foxp3cre/creBcl6fl/flTfrcell–deficient mice developed milder EAE than wild-type (WT) mice. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that the reduction of encephalomyelitis in Tfrcell–deficient mice was associated with fewer B cells infiltrating the central nervous system. Coculture experiments showed that B cells isolated from brains of WT mice at the peak of the disease fostered pro-inflammatory cytokine production by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein–specific T cells. We furthermore showed that sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) expression in GC B cells was up-regulated in Tfrcell–deficient mice. Treatment with an S1PR2 receptor antagonist abrogated the improved EAE clinical scores in Tfrcell–deficient mice, and this loss of protection was associated with increased B cell infiltration into the brain and increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production by encephalitogenic T cells. These findings demonstrate that Tfrcells contribute to autoimmune encephalomyelitis and suggest that their blood frequency reflects MS activity.",

    "title": "Analysis of stress-induced small proteins inEscherichia colireveals that YoaI mediates cross-talk between distinct signaling systems",
    "abstract": "AbstractBacterial small proteins (≤50 amino acids) are an emerging class of regulators that modulate the activity of signaling networks that enable bacterial adaptation to stress. TheEscherichia coligenome encodes at least 150 small proteins, most of which are functionally uncharacterized. We identified and characterized 17 small proteins induced inE.coliduring magnesium (Mg2+) starvation using ribosome profiling, RNA sequencing, and transcriptional reporter assays. Several of these were transcriptionally activated by the PhoQ-PhoP two-component signaling system, which is crucial for Mg2+homeostasis. Deletion or overexpression of some of these small proteins led to growth defects and changes in cell size under low-Mg2+conditions, indicating physiological roles in stress adaptation. The small transmembrane protein YoaI, which was transcriptionally induced by the phosphate-responsive PhoR-PhoB signaling pathway, increased in abundance under Mg2+limitation independently ofyoaItranscription or PhoQ-PhoP signaling. YoaI activated a third signaling system, EnvZ-OmpR, which mediates responses to osmotic stress. Overall, this study establishes an initial framework for understanding how small proteins contribute to bacterial stress adaptation by facilitating cross-talk between different signaling systems. Our results suggest that these proteins play broader roles in coordinating stress responses, reflecting the interconnected nature of cellular stress networks rather than strictly compartmentalized pathways responding to specific stressors.",

Here, we report that reprogramming Tregcells by shifting the expression of FOXP3 from its full-length isoform (FOXP3FL) to a short isoform with exon 2 skipped (FOXP3dE2) promotes CD8 T cell–mediated antitumor immunity.FOXP3dE2mRNA expression in triple-negative breast cancer tissue positively correlated with overall patient survival. Mice expressing only the FOXP3dE2isoform were resistant to the development of multiple types of tumors. Tumor-infiltrating Tregcells expressing the FOXP3dE2isoform exhibited lower immunosuppressive activity and promoted CD8 T cell activation. In addition, we designed a morpholino oligo to induce FOXP3 exon 2 skipping, which similarly enhanced antitumor activity in mouse tumor models and the killing capacity of autologous tumor-infiltrating T cells against patient-derived tumor organoids. Our results suggest that promoting FOXP3dE2expression reprograms Tregcells to T helper–like cells, thereby enhancing antitumor immunity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAn effective prophylactic HIV vaccine will likely need to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). bnAbs to the Apex region of the HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env) are promising targets for vaccination because of their relatively low somatic hypermutation compared with other bnAbs. Most Apex bnAbs engage Env using an exceptionally long heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (HCDR3) containing specific binding motifs, which reduces bnAb precursor frequency and makes priming of rare bnAb precursors a likely limiting step in the path to Apex bnAb induction. We found that adjuvanted protein or mRNA lipid nanoparticle (LNP) immunization of rhesus macaques with ApexGT6, an Env trimer engineered to bind Apex bnAb precursors, consistently induced Apex bnAb–related precursors with long HCDR3s bearing bnAb-like sequence motifs. Cryo–electron microscopy revealed that elicited Apex bnAb–related HCDR3s had structures combining elements of several prototype Apex bnAbs. These results achieve a critical HIV vaccine development milestone in outbred primates.",

    "abstract": "AbstractModular microrobotics can potentially address many information-intensive microtasks in medicine, manufacturing, and the environment. However, surface area has limited the natural powering, communication, functional integration, and self-assembly of smart mass-fabricated modular robotic devices at small scales. We demonstrate the integrated self-folding and self-rolling of functionalized patterned interior and exterior membrane surfaces resulting in programmable, self-assembling, intercommunicating, and self-locomoting micromodules (smartlets ≤ 1 cubic millimeter) with interior chambers for onboard buoyancy control. The microrobotic divers, with 360° solar harvesting rolls, functioned with sufficient ambient power for communication and programmed locomotion in water via electrolysis. The interior folding faces carried rigid microcomponents, including silicon chiplets (Si chiplets) as microprocessors and micro–light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for communication. The exterior faces were able to engage in specific patterned docking interactions between smartlets. The heterogeneous integration is mass producible and affordable through two-dimensional (2D)–automated lithography and microchiplet bump-bonding processes, here shown to be compatible with subsequent autonomous 3D folding and rolling. The robotic modules functioned in natural aqueous environments, and the technology was analyzed as scalable down to microscopic dimensions. Selectively addressed communication with individual smartlets was enhanced via frequency-specific optical signals and enabled precise control, allowing each smartlet to be activated independently within a collective system. The work remodels modular microrobotics closer to the surface-rich modular autonomy of biological cells and provides an economical platform for microscopic applications.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNoradrenaline released from sympathetic neurons accelerates cancer metastasis by activating β2-adrenergic receptors (β2-adrenoceptors) on tumor cells to promote invasion. We previously showed that the β2-adrenoceptor promotes invasive behavior in a metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line by activating a cAMP- and calcium-mediated feedforward loop. Here, we found this mechanism in most TNBC lines that have an active β2-adrenoceptor. Integrated analysis of transcriptomic datasets revealedHOXC12, which encodes a developmental homeobox transcription factor, as the most discriminating gene separating cell lines with the feedforward loop and those without it. The high expression ofHOXC12did not correlate with transcriptional changes in integral proteins associated with cAMP or calcium signaling, and immunostaining showed cytosolic localization of Hox-C12, suggesting that it played a nontranscriptional role. Knocking outHOXC12prevented β2-adrenoceptor–mediated calcium signaling and invasion in cultured TNBC cells. In basal breast cancers,HOXC12expression in tumors negatively correlated with overall and disease-free survival in patients. These findings identify a key mediator, Hox-C12, in the coordination of invasion driven by cAMP and calcium signaling in β2-adrenoceptor–responsive TNBC cells.",

    "title": "Amylin receptor subunit interactions are modulated by agonists and determine signaling",
    "abstract": "AbstractThree amylin receptors (AMYRs) mediate the metabolic actions of the peptide hormone amylin and are drug targets for diabetes and obesity. AMY1R, AMY2R, and AMY3R are heterodimers consisting of the calcitonin receptor (CTR), a G protein–coupled receptor, paired with a RAMP1, RAMP2, or RAMP3 accessory subunit, respectively, which increases amylin potency. Here, we found that the AMYRs had distinct basal subunit equilibria that were modulated by peptide agonists and determined the extent of cAMP signaling downstream of receptor activation. By developing a biochemical assay that resolves the AMYR heterodimers and free subunits, we found that the AMY1R and AMY2R subunit distributions favored free CTR and RAMPs and that rat amylin promoted association of the constituent subunits of AMY1R and AMY2R. The agonist αCGRP also induced AMY1R subunit association. A stronger interaction between the CTR and the RAMP3 transmembrane domains yielded a more stable AMY3R, and human and salmon calcitonin agonists promoted AMY3R dissociation. Similar changes in subunit association and dissociation were observed in live-cell membranes, and G protein coupling and cAMP signaling assays showed how these changes altered signaling. Our findings have implications for AMYR biology and drug development and reveal regulation of heteromeric GPCR signaling through subunit interaction dynamics.",

    "title": "Combined Flt3L and CD40 agonism restores dendritic cell–driven T cell immunity in pancreatic cancer",
    "abstract": "AbstractT cell–directed immunotherapies have largely failed to slow progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) because of poor tumor antigenicity and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. We hypothesized that conventional dendritic cell (cDC) suppression in PDAC may further impair tumor immunity. We found that low tissue expression of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L) partially underlies cDC deficits. Treatment with systemic Flt3L and CD40 agonists restored cDC number and function in murine models and clinical trial samples from patients with PDAC. CD40 agonism alone did not fully activate cDCs; however, when combined with Flt3L, dual therapy triggered a cDC-driven type I immune response characterized by T cell infiltration, interleukin-12 production, and reciprocal interferon-γ (IFN-γ) responses. In mice, cDC1s were responsible for CD8+T cell expansion, and in turn, T cell–derived IFN-γ enhanced cDC1 survival. Nevertheless, Flt3L and CD40 agonism increased regulatory T cells through the activation of cDC2s, dampening immunity. These findings advocate further exploration of DC-centered approaches to enhance antitumor immunity in PDAC.",

    "abstract": "AbstractLymph node (LN) stromal cells are critical regulators of immune reactions, yet their responses to different SARS-CoV-2 vaccines remain unexplored. Here, we immunized mice with clinically approved gene- and protein-based COVID-19 vaccines targeting viral spike (S) protein and analyzed the draining LN stroma using multimodal bioimaging, single-cell transcriptomics, and functional studies. We found that messenger RNA and adenovirus vector vaccines transfected lymphatic endothelial cell and fibroblastic reticular cell subsets in vivo and led to early local S protein production in the draining LN in a vaccine-specific manner. The vaccines induced rapid transcriptomic reprogramming of the LN stromal cells, which functionally altered scavenging and parenchymal transfer of lymph-borne antigens, formation of chemokine gradients, and migration of eosinophils within LNs. Thus, distinct vaccine formulations targeting S protein differentially prime the draining LN stromal cells before the arrival of migratory dendritic cells bearing immunogens.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPeripheral helper T (TPH) cells can play pathogenic roles in human autoimmune diseases. TPHcells are proposed to be the major B cell helpers in inflamed joints in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but whether and how TPHcells are engaged in tissue inflammation remains unclear. We demonstrate that TPHcells comprise two subsets in RA: stem-like TPH(S-TPH) and effector TPH(E-TPH) cells. These two subsets differed in transcriptome, epigenome, B cell helper capacity, spatial localization, and cell interactions. S-TPHcells displayed self-renewal capacity and were mainly found within tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) in synovial tissue together with B cells. S-TPHcells potently induced B cells to produce immunoglobulins. By contrast, E-TPHcells expressed effector molecules and colocalized with proinflammatory macrophages and CD8+T cells outside TLSs. S-TPHcells could differentiate into E-TPHcells upon TCR stimulation and coculture with B cells. Collectively, our study shows that S-TPHcells play a central role in promoting TPHresponses by undergoing self-renewal and seeding E-TPHcells.",

    "abstract": "AbstractExploration of lava caves on the surface of planetary bodies near Earth is of high importance for scientific research and space exploration. The natural shielding that these caves offer against radiation and small meteorites makes them well suited for preserving exobiological signatures and protecting human-made facilities. The use of a robot team arises as the safest and most cost-efficient way to explore extraterrestrial lava caves because they are difficult to access. Although the approach has been demonstrated in similar scenarios on Earth, its adaptation to space conditions needs further research. Here, we define a lava cave exploration mission concept, including four mission phases that are performed by a heterogeneous team of three robots equipped with the required hardware and software. This mission concept was validated in a relevant scenario, a lava cave on Lanzarote island (Spain), where the team of robots was able to build a three-dimensional model of the surrounding area and skylight, introducing a scout rover through rappelling and exploring the inner part of the cave. The results obtained demonstrate the proposed mission concept’s feasibility, including three next-generation planetary exploration rovers that were coordinated to obtain meaningful information about the lava cave’s external and internal morphology.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSoft robots, with their compliant bodies, minimal environmental disturbance, and ability to withstand ambient pressures, offer promising solutions for deep-sea exploration. However, a common challenge of stiffening in soft materials impairs their effective actuation in harsh conditions. In this work, we integrated a liquid dielectric plasticizer within an electrohydraulic soft robot, serving dual critical functions as a softening agent to maintain the softness of the polymer shell and an electrohydraulic fluid for efficient actuation. In addition, by using the surrounding seawater as alternating electrodes, we prevented charge retention in dielectric layers, enabling sustained actuation performance. Field tests at depths of ~1360, 3176, and ~4071 meters confirmed the robot’s ability to sense the environment, navigate complex trajectories, and withstand unsteady disturbances. Our work offers a generalized and straightforward framework for developing soft materials tailored for deep-sea applications, paving the way for soft robots to execute real-world missions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIncreases in retroelement-derived double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) in various types of cancer cells facilitate the activation of antitumor immune responses. The long noncoding RNA EPIC1 interacts with the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and contributes to tumor immune evasion. Here, we found that EPIC1 in tumor cells suppressed cytoplasmic dsRNA accumulation, type I interferon (IFN) responses, and antitumor immunity. In various cancer cell lines, knockdown of EPIC1 stimulated the production of dsRNA from retroelements and an antiviral-like type I IFN response that activated immune cells. EPIC1 inhibited the expression of LINE, SINE, and LTR retroelements that were also repressed by EZH2, suggesting a potential role for the EPIC1-EZH2 interaction in regulating dsRNA production. In a humanized mouse model, in vivo delivery of EPIC1-targeting oligonucleotides enhanced dsRNA accumulation in breast cancer xenografts, reduced tumor growth, and increased the infiltration of T cells and inflammatory macrophages into tumors. Furthermore, EPIC1 knockdown improved the therapeutic efficacy of the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, in the humanized mouse model. Together, our findings establish EPIC1 as a key regulator of dsRNA-mediated type I IFN responses and highlight its potential as a therapeutic target to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "AbstractEpithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) occurs heterogeneously among carcinoma cells to promote chemoresistance. Identifying the signaling pathways involved will nominate drug combinations to promote chemoresponse, but cell population–level studies can be misleading, and single-cell transcriptomics are limited to indirect ontology-based inferences. To understand EMT heterogeneity at a signaling protein level, we combined iterative indirect immunofluorescence imaging of pancreas cancer cells and tumors and mutual information (MI) analysis. Focusing first on mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, MI indicated that cell-to-cell variation in ERK activity determined EMT heterogeneity in response to different growth factors and chemotherapeutics but that JNK compensated when MEK was inhibited. Population-level models could not capture these experimentally validated MI inferences. The dominant role of ERK was consistently indicated by MI even when the analysis was expanded to include seven potential EMT-regulating signaling nodes. More generally, this work provides an approach for studying multivariate signaling-phenotype relationships based on protein measurements in any setting.",

We report that BUB1 plays an unexpected cytoplasmic role in restraining DNA damage–induced accumulation of cytoplasmic dsRNA and the ensuing immune response. Tumors deficient in BUB1 were sensitive to radiotherapy in a CD8 T cell–dependent manner. We found increased immune cell infiltration accompanied by elevated type I interferon production from irradiated BUB1-deficient cells caused by enhanced cytoplasmic dsRNA accumulation and activation of the MDA5/MAVS dsRNA-sensing pathway. Mechanistically, we found that after radiation exposure, BUB1 underwent nucleus-to-cytoplasm migration, where it bound and phosphorylated the poly(A)-binding protein PABPC1, which was degraded together with its associated messenger RNAs stored in the stress granules, thereby preventing dsRNA accumulation and activation of the innate immune response.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPulmonary conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) are functionally and phenotypically heterogeneous antigen-presenting cells essential for orchestrating adaptive immune responses in the lung. Here, we define a cell-intrinsic role for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) signaling in the development of a CD301b+subset of terminally differentiated cDC2s, in addition to CD103+XCR1+cDC1s. Unbiased single-cell transcriptomic profiling of CD11c+cells identified both immature and differentiated lung cDC populations. GM-CSF deficiency disrupted antiapoptotic Bcl2a1 up-regulation and impaired progression to the CD301b+transcriptional state. Despite the positioning of CD301b+cDC2s in lymphoid cell–rich adventitial cuff areas, hematopoietic GM-CSF was dispensable for their development. Instead, alveolar epithelial type 2 cell–derived GM-CSF was required for CD301b+cDC2 formation and pulmonary type 2 immune responses, highlighting the central role of GM-CSF signaling in shaping the pulmonary myeloid landscape.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSmall extracellular vesicles (sEVs) released from tumors recruit nociceptor neurons to the tumor bed. Here, we found that ablating these neurons in mouse models of head and neck carcinoma and melanoma reduced the infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Moreover, sEV-deficient tumors failed to develop in mice lacking nociceptor neurons. We investigated the interplay between tumor-infiltrating nociceptors and immune cells in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and melanoma. Upon exposure to cancer-derived sEVs, mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons secreted increased amounts of substance P, IL-6, and injury-associated neuronal markers. Patient-derived sEVs sensitized DRG neurons to capsaicin, implying enhanced nociceptor responsiveness. Furthermore, nociceptors cultured with sEVs induced an immunosuppressed state in CD8+T cells. Incubation with conditioned medium from cocultures of neurons and cancer cells resulted in increased expression of markers of MDSCs and suppressive function in primary bone marrow cells, and the combination of neuron-conditioned medium and cancer sEVs promoted checkpoint receptor expression on T cells. Together, these findings reveal that nociceptor neurons facilitate CD8+T cell exhaustion and bolster MDSC infiltration into HNSCC and melanoma. Consequently, targeting nociceptors may provide a strategy to disrupt detrimental neuroimmune cross-talk in cancer and potentiate antitumor immunity.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHuman CD4+T cells play a central role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, but their immunoregulatory mechanisms driving pathogenesis remain to be elucidated. We show that human T peripheral helper cells (TPHcells) regulate peripheral immune responses via insulin-like growth factor–like family member 2 (IGFL2), an inflammatory factor found exclusively in primates. Single-cell RNA sequencing of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium showed thatIGFL2is specifically expressed by CD4+T cells, predominantly TPHcells. IGFL2 promotes transforming growth factor–β–induced CXCL13 production in CD4+T cells, activates nuclear factor κB signaling, and induces monocyte gene signatures like those of pathogenic macrophages. CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of IGFL2 in synovial TPHcells suppressed this gene signature in cocultured monocytes. Blood IGFL2 protein levels correlated with RA disease severity and could be used as a potential biomarker. These findings highlight the involvement of IGFL2 in RA pathogenesis, emphasizing how human TPHcells regulate local immune responses via IGFL2.",

    "abstract": "AbstractInfluenza viruses are a major global cause of morbidity and mortality. Although vagal TRPV1+nociceptive sensory neurons are known to mediate defenses against harmful agents, including pathogens, their function in lung antiviral defenses remains unclear. Our study demonstrates that both systemic and vagal-specific ablation of TRPV1+nociceptors reduce survival in mice infected with influenza A virus (IAV). Despite no difference in viral load, mice lacking TRPV1+neurons exhibited increased viral spread, exacerbated lung pathology, and elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Loss of TRPV1+neurons altered the lung immune landscape, including an expansion of neutrophils and monocyte-derived macrophages. Transcriptional analysis revealed impaired interferon signaling in myeloid cells and an imbalance in distinct neutrophil subpopulations in the absence of nociceptors. Furthermore, antibody-mediated depletion of myeloid cells during IAV infection substantially improved survival after nociceptor ablation, underscoring the role of TRPV1+neurons in preventing pathogenic myeloid cell states that contribute to IAV-induced mortality.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHealthy aging relies on a symbiotic host-microbiota relationship. The age-associated decline of the immune system can pose a threat to this delicate equilibrium. In this work, we investigated how the functional deterioration of T cells can affect host-microbiota symbiosis and gut barrier integrity and the implications of this deterioration for inflammaging, senescence, and health decline. Using theTfamfl/flCd4Cremouse model, we found that T cell failure compromised gut immunity leading to a decrease in T follicular cells and regulatory T cells (Tregcells) and an accumulation of highly proinflammatory and cytotoxic T cells. These alterations were associated with intestinal barrier disruption and gut dysbiosis. Microbiota depletion or adoptive transfer of total CD4 T cells or a Tregcell–enriched pool prevented gut barrier dysfunction and mitigated premature inflammaging and senescence, ultimately enhancing the health span in this mouse model. Thus, a competent CD4 T cell compartment is critical to ensure healthier aging by promoting host-microbiota mutualism and gut barrier integrity.",

Here, we investigated the role of ubiquitin-specific protease 5 (USP5) in IgE-mediated mast cell activation and its regulation of FcεRIγ stability. We found that USP5 knockdown inhibited the IgE-induced release of β-hexosaminidase and histamine from mast cells and attenuated allergic inflammation in mice. USP5 interacted with FcεRIγ in mast cells, leading to its deubiquitylation and stabilization. In addition, USP5 reversed the K48-linked polyubiquitylation of FcεRIγ. USP5 knockdown in mast cells or HEK293T cells increased the binding of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl-b to FcεRIγ, leading to an increase in FcεRIγ polyubiquitylation and degradation. The USP5 inhibitor WP1130 attenuated IgE-mediated mast cell activation and allergic inflammation in mice. Together, these findings describe the molecular mechanism of USP5-mediated regulation of FcεRIγ stability in mast cells and identify the USP5-FcεRIγ axis as a potential drug target for the therapy of IgE/FcεRI-mediated allergic diseases.",

The inhibitors used target these mutant forms of KRAS, the downstream effectors MEK and ERK, and the upstream regulators SHP2 and SOS1. Comparisons of phosphoproteomes between cell lines revealed a core KRAS signaling signature and cell line–specific signaling networks. In all cell lines, phosphoproteomes were dominated by different degrees of autonomous, oncogenic KRAS activity. Comparison of phosphoproteomes after short and long drug exposures revealed the temporal dynamics of KRAS-MEK-ERK axis inhibition that resulted in cell cycle exit. This transition to a quiescent state occurred in the absence of substantial proteome remodeling but included broad changes in protein phosphorylation and ubiquitylation. The collective data reveal insights into oncogenic KRAS signaling, place many additional proteins into this functional context, and implicate cell cycle exit as a mechanism by which cells evade death upon KRAS signaling inhibition.",

    "title": "Regulatory T cells in brown adipose tissue safeguard thermogenesis by restraining interferon-γ–producing lymphocytes",
    "abstract": "AbstractWhereas visceral adipose tissue (VAT) primarily stores excess energy, brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates it in a process termed nonshivering thermogenesis. Several key VAT features, particularly murine epidydimal VAT, are regulated by a distinct population of regulatory T (Treg) cells, raising the question of whether BAT hosts an analogous population. Although Tregcells have been observed in BAT, their properties and mechanisms of action require elucidation. We found BAT Tregcells to be heterogeneous in subtissular localization and subtype composition. Punctual depletion of Tregcells unleashed interferon-γ (IFN-γ)–producing lymphocytes in BAT, but not in subcutaneous or visceral fat depots, leading to IFN-γ–dependent mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic dysregulation, thereby impeding nonshivering thermogenesis. Cold challenge selectively expanded the IL-18R1+Tregsubtype in BAT; stripping this receptor specifically from Tregcells unleashed IFN-γ–producing lymphocytes and compromised temperature control. Thus, control of local IFN-γ production is a core feature of Tregcell control of tissue homeostasis.",

    "title": "Deletion of PTP1B in cardiomyocytes alters cardiac metabolic signaling to protect against cardiomyopathy induced by a high-fat diet",
    "abstract": "AbstractCardiomyocytes (CMs) normally use fatty acid oxidation (FAO) as their primary energy source. In response to pathological stress, the substrate preference of CMs switches from FAO to glucose metabolism, leading to the development of heart failure. Obesity increases this pathological risk of cardiovascular disease. We focused on protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), an inhibitor of insulin signaling, the abundance and activity of which are increased in brain, muscle, and adipose tissues in obese and/or diabetic animals and in obese human patients. We generated mice with CM-specific deficiency in PTP1B (PTP1Bfl/fl::ꭤMHCCre/+) to investigate the CM-specific role of PTP1B in response to cardiac dysfunction induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Although no physiological or functional cardiac differences were observed at baseline,PTP1Bfl/fl::ꭤMHCCre/+mice were protected against development of cardiac hypertrophy, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cardiac steatosis induced by HFD feeding. Metabolomics data revealed that hearts with CM-specific deletion of PTP1B had increased FAO and lipolysis but reduced glucose metabolism. Furthermore, phosphoproteomics analyses and mechanistic studies identified an axis involving the kinases PKM2 and AMPK downstream of PTP1B in the heart, which collectively acted to promote FAO and suppress lipogenesis. Together, these results suggest that CM-specific deletion of PTP1B prevents a substrate switch from FAO to glucose metabolism, protecting the heart against the development of HFD-induced cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "AbstractTherapy-induced acquired resistance limits the clinical effectiveness of mutation-specific KRAS inhibitors in colorectal cancer (CRC). Here, we investigated whether broad-spectrum, active-state RAS inhibitors meet similar limitations. We found that KRAS-mutant CRC cell lines were sensitive to the RAS(ON) multiselective RAS inhibitor RMC-7977, given that treatment resulted in RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway inhibition; halted proliferation; and, in some cases, induced apoptosis. RMC-7977 initially reduced the activity of a compartment-specific, dual-color reporter of ERK activity, with reporter reactivation emerging after long-term dose escalation. These drug-resistant cell populations exhibited distinct patterns of phospho-protein abundance, transcriptional activities, and genomic mutations, including a Y71H mutation in KRAS and an S257L mutation in RAF1. Transgenic expression of KRASG13D, Y71Hor RAF1S257Lin drug-sensitive CRC cells induced resistance to RMC-7977. CRC cells that were resistant to RMC-7977 and harboring RAF1S257Lexhibited synergistic sensitivity to concurrent inhibition of RAS and RAF. Our findings demonstrate the power of reporter-assisted screening together with single-cell analyses for dissecting the complex landscape of therapy resistance. The strategy offers opportunities to develop clinically relevant combinatorial treatments to counteract the emergence of resistant cancer cells.",

Intestinal fibroblasts are believed to play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of UC, but the influence of the host-microbiota interaction on the pathophysiology of intestinal fibroblasts remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that OTU deubiquitinase 3 (OTUD3) suppresses pathologic activation of fibroblasts exposed to microbial cyclic GMP-AMP (3′3’-cGAMP) in the colon by deubiquitinating stimulator of interferon genes (STING). Mice harboring a UC risk missense variant in theOtud3gene showed pathological features of UC in the colon after transplantation of a fecal microbiota with the potential to produce excessive cGAMP from patients with UC. Collectively, these results highlight a mechanism of the interaction between OTUD3 in host fibroblasts and STING-activating microbiota in UC development.",

In this study, we explored how the properties of HBCs change throughout gestation. Our analysis revealed transcriptomic differences between first-trimester and term HBCs, with many of the altered genes linked to immune responses. As pregnancy progresses, HBCs exhibit a marked decrease in phagosome maturation and acidification. We show that the differences between first-trimester and term HBCs are important in the context of infection withListeria monocytogenes, a pathogen that crosses the placenta and replicates within macrophages. Specifically, we observed reduced colony-forming units and diminished actin recruitment byL. monocytogenesin first-trimester HBCs compared with term HBCs. Our findings indicate that the ability ofL. monocytogenesto escape from vacuoles is impaired within first-trimester HBCs. Thus, the changes in HBC biology across pregnancy are important in shaping their interactions withL. monocytogenes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractCD8+T cells are classically defined by cytotoxic activity, but it has remained unclear whether cytotoxic programs are compartmentalized across tissues and memory subsets. Here, we established a human organ donor cohort and found that expression of conventional cytotoxic molecules—granulysin, perforin, and granzyme B—was most prominent among circulating memory CD8+T cells and decreased progressively with tissue residency, inversely mirroring the expression of CD69 and CD103. Other cytotoxic molecules, including granzymes A, H, K, and M, were variably expressed across tissues, and memory CD8+T cells targeting persistent viruses expressed multiple granzymes coordinately. In an in vitro tonsil system, transforming growth factor–β induced discordant regulation of cytotoxic molecules and CD103. Combined with interleukin-15, this circuitry modulated proliferation and the acquisition of redirected killing activity via perforin and granzyme B. Our findings suggest that human memory CD8+T cell cytotoxicity is intricately regulated by environmental cues reflecting tissue location and antigen specificity.",

    "title": "Astrocytic RIPK3 exerts protective anti-inflammatory activity in mice with viral encephalitis by transcriptional induction of serpins",
    "abstract": "AbstractFlaviviruses pose a substantial threat to public health because of their ability to infect the central nervous system (CNS). Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) is a central coordinator that promotes neuroinflammation during viral infection of the CNS, a role that occurs independently of its canonical function in inducing necroptosis. Here, we used mouse genetic tools to induce astrocyte-specific deletion, overexpression, and chemogenetic activation of RIPK3 to demonstrate an anti-inflammatory function for astrocytic RIPK3. RIPK3 activation in astrocytes promoted host survival during flavivirus encephalitis by limiting immune cell recruitment to the CNS. Despite inducing a proinflammatory transcriptional program, astrocytic RIPK3 restrained neuroinflammation by increasing the abundance of the protease inhibitor SerpinA3N, which preserved blood-brain barrier integrity, reduced leukocyte infiltration, and improved survival outcomes during flavivirus encephalitis. These findings highlight a previously unappreciated role for astrocytic RIPK3 in suppressing pathologic neuroinflammation.",

    "title": "Autophosphorylation of oncoprotein TEL-ABL in myeloid and lymphoid cells confers resistance to the allosteric ABL inhibitor asciminib",
    "abstract": "AbstractChromosomal translocations that fuseABL1toBCRorTELcause human leukemias. In BCR-ABL and TEL-ABL fusion proteins, oligomerization and loss of an autoinhibitory myristoylation site in the SH3 domain of ABL lead to increased ABL tyrosine kinase activity. We assessed the ability of asciminib, an allosteric inhibitor of BCR-ABL that binds to the myristoyl-binding site in the ABL kinase domain, to inhibit these fusion proteins. Although the ABL components of the two fusion proteins have identical sequences, asciminib was much less effective against TEL-ABL than it was against BCR-ABL in cell-growth assays. In contrast, ATP-competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib and ponatinib, were equally effective against both fusion proteins. A helix in the ABL kinase domain that closes over bound asciminib was required for the sensitivity of BCR-ABL to the drug but had no effect on that of TEL-ABL, suggesting that the native autoinhibitory mechanism that asciminib engages in BCR-ABL is disrupted in TEL-ABL. Single-molecule microscopy demonstrated that BCR-ABL was mainly dimeric in cells, whereas TEL-ABL formed higher-order oligomers, which promoted trans-autophosphorylation, including of a regulatory phosphorylation site (Tyr89) in the SH3 domain of ABL. Nonphosphorylated TEL-ABL was intrinsically susceptible to inhibition by asciminib, but phosphorylation at Tyr89disassembled the autoinhibited conformation of ABL, thereby preventing asciminib from binding. Our results demonstrate that phosphorylation determines whether an ABL fusion protein is sensitive to allosteric inhibition.",

    "abstract": "AbstractNorrin-induced activation of β-catenin–dependent signaling through the receptor frizzled4 in endothelial cells (ECs) is essential for establishing and maintaining blood-CNS barrier function. We sought to determine how this pathway is modulated under stress or disease conditions. Specifically, we investigated the role of p53 in endothelial blood-CNS barriers because increased abundance of the transcription factor p53 in ECs correlates with leaky CNS blood vessels in type 2 diabetes. Using transcriptomic, cell-based, and mouse genetic approaches, we identified interplay between p53 and its negative regulator MDM2 and norrin/frizzled4 signaling. Mice with an EC-specific ablation ofMdm2showed decreased norrin/frizzled4 signaling, reduced EC proliferation and retinal angiogenesis, and disrupted blood-retina barrier function, all of which were largely restored by concurrentTrp53deletion. Decreased norrin/frizzled4 signaling and inhibition of EC proliferation in response to p53 were associated with reduced expression of the condensin I complex component non-SMC condensin I complex subunit H (NCAPH). This study identifies a regulator of norrin/frizzled4 signaling and suggests that the clinical use of MDM2 inhibitors might impair the blood-CNS barrier. In addition, NCAPH may be a downstream effector of p53 in ECs and a candidate gene for familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), which is caused by defects in norrin signaling.",

    "title": "Restoration of striatal neuroprotective pathways by kinase inhibitor treatment of Parkinson’s disease–linkedLRRK2-mutant mice",
    "abstract": "AbstractParkinson’s disease is associated with activating mutations in the gene encoding leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), which suppresses primary cilia formation in cholinergic and parvalbumin interneurons and astrocytes in the striatum. As a result, there is a decrease in the production of neuroprotective glial cell line–derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurturin (NRTN), which normally support the viability of dopaminergic neurons. MLi-2 is a brain-penetrant, selective, and now experimental inhibitor of LRRK2. Here, we found that dietary administration of MLi-2 to young LRRK2-mutant mice for 3 months restored primary cilia formation and Hedgehog signaling in both cholinergic and parvalbumin interneurons and astrocytes. The treatment also restored the Hedgehog-responsive expression ofGdnfandNrtnin the neurons. Cilia were also restored on cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine nucleus, where their loss correlates with severity of motor impairment in patients. Furthermore, MLi-2 increased the density of fine striatal dopaminergic processes and decreased the amount of stress-associated Sonic Hedgehog RNA expression in nigral dopaminergic neurons. Thus, pathogenic LRRK2-driven cilia loss is reversible in postmitotic neurons and astrocytes, which suggests that early administration of specific LRRK2 inhibitors may therapeutically benefit patients.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe identification of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)–associated genomic variants has provided powerful insight into disease etiology. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of AD have successfully identified previously unidentified targets but have almost exclusively used additive genetic models. Here, we performed a family-based GWAS of a recessive inheritance model using whole-genome sequencing from families affected by AD. We found an association between AD risk and the variant rs7161410, which is located in an intron of thePRKCHgene encoding protein kinase C eta (PKCη). In addition, a rarePRKCHmissense mutation, K65R, was in linkage disequilibrium with rs7161410 and was present in homozygous carriers of the rs7161410 risk allele. In vitro analysis revealed that the catalytic rate, lipid dependence, and peptide substrate binding of the purified variant were indistinguishable from those of the wild-type kinase. However, cellular studies revealed that the K65R PKCη variant had reduced cytosolic activity and, instead, enhanced localization and signaling at the Golgi. Moreover, the K65R variant had altered interaction networks in transfected cells, particularly with proteins involved in Golgi processes such as vesicle transport. In human brain tissue, the AD-associated recessive genotype of rs7161410 was associated with increased expression ofPRKCH, particularly in the amygdala. This association of aberrant PKCη signaling with AD and the insight into how its function is altered may lead to previously unidentified therapeutic targets for prevention and treatment.",

    "abstract": "AbstractFOXA1 is altered in 10 to 40% of prostate cancers, yet its oncogenic mechanisms remain uncharacterized in vivo. We developed knock-in mouse models representing distinct classes of FOXA1 mutations. Histopathological and multiomic analyses of prostate tissues and organoids revealed that Class 1 mutations, in conjunction withp53inactivation, drive androgen-dependent adenocarcinomas through coactivation of mTORC1/2 and oncogenic AR signaling stemming from chimeric AR-half enhancers. By contrast, Class 2 mutations induce intraluminal plasticity by reprogramming differentiated luminal cells into a progenitor-like state through activation of KLF5 and AP-1 neo-enhancer circuitries, which enables enhanced survival and proliferation even under castrate androgen levels. Our findings establish FOXA1 as a multifaceted oncogene, with distinct mutational classes divergently evolving to drive prostate tumorigenesis or therapy-resistant progression.",

Loss-of-function mutations indedicator of cytokinesis 8(Dock8) are associated with immunodeficiency as immune cells becoming entangled during migration through dense environments, but their migration on two-dimensional surfaces remains entirely intact. Here, we investigated the specific cytoskeletal defect ofDock8-deficient activated T cells and describe a central pool of F-actin in wild-type murine and human T cells that is absent inDock8knockout T cells. The appearance of the central actin pool is mechanoresponsive and emerges only when cells are very confined. We identified mammalian sterile 20-like (Mst1) as a necessary component in this mechanosensitive pathway in addition to Dock8, allowing for cell shape integrity and survival during migration through complex environments. Our work shows that loss of the central actin pool results in greater nuclear deformation, accrual of DNA damage, and premature cell senescence.",

    "title": "Photocatalytic microrobots for treating bacterial infections deep within sinuses",
    "abstract": "AbstractMicrorobotic techniques are promising for treating biofilm infections located deep within the human body. However, the presence of highly viscous pus presents a formidable biological barrier, severely restricting targeted and minimally invasive treatments. In addition, conventional antibacterial agents exhibit limited payload integration with microrobotic systems, further compromising therapeutic efficiency. In this study, we propose a photocatalytic microrobot through a magnetically guided, optical fiber–assisted therapeutic platform specifically designed to treat bacterial infections in deep mucosal cavities. The microrobots comprising copper (Cu) single atom–doped bismuth oxoiodide (BiOI), termed CBMRs, can be guided and tracked by real-time x-ray imaging. Under external magnetic actuation, the illuminated region from the magnetically guided optical fiber synchronously follows the CBMR swarm, enabling effective antibacterial action at targeted infection sites. Upon continuous visible-light irradiation, the resultant photothermal effect substantially reduces the viscosity of pus on inflamed mucosal tissues, enhancing the penetration capability of the CBMR swarm by more than threefold compared with baseline conditions. Concurrently, atomic-level design of CBMRs facilitates robust generation of reactive oxygen species, enabling efficient biofilm disruption and reductions in bacterial viability. We validated the effectiveness of this integrated optical fiber–assisted microrobotic platform in a rabbit sinusitis model in vivo, demonstrating its potential for clinically relevant infection therapy.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAlthough the field of wearable robotic exoskeletons is rapidly expanding, there are several barriers to entry that discourage many from pursuing research in this area, ultimately hindering growth. Chief among these is the lengthy and costly development process to get an exoskeleton from conception to implementation and the necessity for a broad set of expertise. In addition, many exoskeletons are designed for a specific utility and are confined to the laboratory environment, limiting the flexibility of the designed system to adapt to answer new questions and explore new domains. To address these barriers, we present OpenExo, an open-source modular untethered exoskeleton framework that provides access to all aspects of the design process, including software, electronics, hardware, and control schemes. To demonstrate the utility of this exoskeleton framework, we performed benchtop and experimental validation testing with the system across multiple configurations, including hip-only incline assistance, ankle-only indoor and outdoor assistance, hip-and-ankle load carriage assistance, and elbow-only weightlifting assistance. All aspects of the software architecture, electrical components, hip and Bowden-cable transmission designs, and control schemes are freely available for other researchers to access, use, and modify when looking to address research questions in the field of wearable exoskeletons. Our hope is that OpenExo will accelerate the development and testing of new exoskeleton designs and control schemes while simultaneously encouraging others, including those who would have been turned away from entering the field, to explore new and unique research questions.",

Here, we explored the effect of two opposing, plasticity-associated pathways—cAMP second-messenger signaling and metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1 and mGluR5) signaling—on the transcriptome in hippocampal neurons and how these pathways operate in distinct and coordinated manners to induce structural changes. Integration of transcriptome data and molecular pathway analysis identified central “hub” genes that were rapidly induced by cAMP and/or mGluR1/5 in hippocampal neurons. These included the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Gas5, whose expression was induced specifically by cAMP and which was targeted to dendrites by the kinesin motor protein KIF1A. In the dendrites, Gas5 interacted with various proteins and coding and noncoding RNAs associated with synaptic function and plasticity, and these interactions were altered by cAMP signaling. Gas5 interacted with the microRNA miR-26a-5p and sequestered it from several of its mRNA targets associated with neuronal function and whose translation was induced by cAMP. Gas5 was critical for excitatory synaptic transmission induced by cAMP but not those induced by mGluR1/5. Furthermore, Gas5 deficiency impaired dendritic branching and synapse morphology, and Gas5 abundance was decreased in the hippocampus of a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Together, these findings provide insight into the transcriptional networks involved in synaptic plasticity and a lncRNA interactome that mediates dendritically localized regulation of excitatory synaptic transmission and neuronal architecture.",

    "title": "Preventing pressure ulcers by increasing pressure: An unorthodox alternating-pressure mattress",
    "abstract": "AbstractDespite the devastating effects of pressure ulcers (PUs), little is understood about how they can be prevented using alternating-pressure (AP) mattresses. Such mattresses typically aim to minimize the pressures imparted while alternating between different states of pressure to prevent areas of tissue from being persistently occluded of blood flow. In this work, we built an actuator bed to study AP approaches and learned that AP mattresses should aim to increase—not decrease—peak pressures to a certain extent if such areas are to be minimized for effectively preventing PUs. In addition, we learned that such mattresses should aim to increase the difference between their loading and off-loading pressures. We identified optimal parameters from the study and used them to design an AP mattress made of compliant mechanisms that markedly reduce areas of persistent occlusion by exhibiting relatively high peak pressures that are periodically alternated with substantially lower off-loading pressures. The mattress’s performance was characterized and compared against a standard foam pad in its flat and raised configurations. The load required to actuate the mattress from one of its stable states of pressure to the other was also measured.",
