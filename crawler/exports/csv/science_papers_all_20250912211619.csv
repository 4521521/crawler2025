43,Robotic reading companions can mitigate oral reading anxiety in children,"AbstractReading fluency is a vital building block for developing literacy, yet the best way to practice fluency—reading aloud—can cause anxiety severe enough to inhibit literacy development in ways that can have an adverse effect on students through adulthood. One promising intervention to mitigate oral reading anxiety is to have children read aloud to a robot. Although observations in prior work have suggested that people likely feel more comfortable in the presence of a robot instead of a human, few studies have empirically demonstrated that people feel less anxious performing in front of a robot compared with a human or used objective physiological indicators to identify decreased anxiety. To investigate whether a robotic reading companion could reduce reading anxiety felt by children, we conducted a within-subjects study where children aged 8 to 11 years (n= 52) read aloud to a human and a robot individually while being monitored for physiological responses associated with anxiety. We found that children exhibited fewer physiological indicators of anxiety, specifically vocal jitter and heart rate variability, when reading to the robot compared with reading to a person. This paper provides strong evidence that a robot’s presence has an effect on the anxiety a person experiences while doing a task, offering justification for the use of robots in a wide-reaching array of social interactions that may be anxiety inducing.",10.1126/scirobotics.adu5771,,Science Robotics,2025-09-10,Lauren L.Wright; https://orcid.org/0009-0002-3659-2530; PoojaVegesna; https://orcid.org/0009-0007-4249-6103; Joseph E.Michaelis; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3793-3659; BilgeMutlu; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9456-1495; SarahSebo; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2211-6429; Authors Info & Affiliations,incremental,2025-09-11T20:55:41,2025-09-11T20:55:41
42,Observing a robot peer’s failures facilitates students’ classroom learning,"AbstractAccording to productive failure (PF) theory, experiencing failure during problem-solving can enhance students’ knowledge acquisition in subsequent instruction. However, challenging students with problems beyond their current capabilities may strain their skills, prior knowledge, and emotional well-being. To address this, we designed a social robot–assisted teaching activity in which students observed a robot’s unsuccessful problem-solving attempts, offering a PF-like preparatory effect without requiring direct failure. We conducted two classroom-based studies in a middle school setting to evaluate the method’s effectiveness. In study 1 (N= 135), we compared three instructional methods—observing robot failure (RF), individual problem-solving failure, and direct instruction—in an eighth-grade mathematics lesson. Students in the RF condition showed the greatest gains in conceptual understanding and reported lower social pressure, although no significant differences were found in procedural knowledge or knowledge transfer. Follow-up study 2 (N= 110) further validated the method’s effectiveness in supporting knowledge acquisition after a 2-week robot-involved adaptation phase, when the novelty effect had largely subsided. Students confirmed their perception of the robot as a peer, and they offered positive evaluations of its intelligence and neutral views of its anthropomorphism. Our findings suggest that observing the robot’s failure has a comparable, or even greater, effect on knowledge acquisition than experiencing failure firsthand. These results underscore the value of social robots as peers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education and highlight the potential of integrating robotics with evidence-based teaching strategies to enhance learning outcomes.",10.1126/scirobotics.adu5257,,Science Robotics,2025-09-10,LiuqingChen; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9049-0394; YuCai; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1994-7176; YuyangFang; https://orcid.org/0009-0001-5604-5449; ZiqiYang; https://orcid.org/0009-0008-8064-7002; DuoweiXia; https://orcid.org/0009-0004-1084-3949; JiaxiangYou; https://orcid.org/0009-0003-8945-5764; ShuhongXiao; https://orcid.org/0009-0007-0615-0607; YaxuanSong; https://orcid.org/0009-0005-2664-4386; LingweiZhan; https://orcid.org/0009-0000-8033-311X; JuanjuanChen; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1273-9465; LingyunSun; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5561-0493; Authors Info & Affiliations,incremental,2025-09-11T20:55:41,2025-09-11T20:55:41

40,Differential modulation of movement speed with state-dependent deep brain stimulation in Parkinson’s disease,"AbstractSubthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) provides unprecedented spatiotemporal precision for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD), allowing for direct real-time state-specific adjustments. Inspired by findings from optogenetic stimulation in mice, we hypothesized that STN-DBS can mimic dopaminergic reinforcement of ongoing movement kinematics during stimulation. To investigate this hypothesis, we delivered DBS bursts during particularly fast and slow movements in 24 patients with PD. Our findings reveal that DBS during fast movements enhanced future movement speed more than DBS during slow movements, raising movement speed to the level of healthy controls. To understand which brain circuits mediate this neurophysiological mechanism, we investigated the behavioral effects using magnetic resonance imaging connectomics and motor cortex electrocorticography. Last, we demonstrate that machine learning–based brain signal decoding can be used to predict continuous movement speed for fully embedded state-dependent closed-loop algorithms. Our findings provide important evidence for reinforcement-based DBS circuit mechanisms that may inspire previously unexplored treatment avenues for dopaminergic disorders.",10.1126/sciadv.adx6849,,Science Advances,2025-09-10,AlessiaCavallo; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1717-1378; Richard M.Köhler; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5219-1289; Johannes L.Busch; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1280-5928; Jeroen G.

39,Printed sensing human-machine interface with individualized adaptive machine learning,"AbstractDeveloping intelligent robots with integrated sensing capabilities is critical for advanced manufacturing, medical robots, and embodied intelligence. Existing robotic sensing technologies are limited to recording of acceleration, driving torque, pressure feedback, and so on. Expanding and integrating with the multimodal sensors to mimic and even surpass the human feeling is substantially underdeveloped. Here, we introduce a printed soft human-machine interface consisting of an e-skin–enabled gesture recognitions with feedback stimulus and a soft robot with multimodal perception of contact pressure, temperature, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity. The sensing e-skin with adaptive machine learning was able to decode and classify the hand gestures with re-wearable convenience and individual’s differences. The soft interface provides the bidirectional communications between robotics and human bodies in the close-loop. This work could substantially extend the robotic intelligence and pave the way for more practical applications.",10.1126/sciadv.adw3725,,Science Advances,2025-09-10,GuohuiWang; https://orcid.org/0009-0001-9934-5759; YaoTang; XinranLuo; https://orcid.org/0009-0005-6328-0753; ShengdiLu; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5313-2902; YiruZhou; YiLu; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0912-7724; GuangyangSun; https://orcid.org/0009-0006-1308-1403; PeiLiu; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6098-5284; JiayuNing; HuaJiang; KeHu; HongzhenLiu; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6687-1752; WenqiSong; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9627-6420; YouYu; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7059-7023; Authors Info & Affiliations,incremental,2025-09-11T19:37:57,2025-09-11T19:37:57
38,Magnetic field–enhanced vertical integration enables embodied intelligence in untethered soft robots,"AbstractEmbodied intelligence in soft robotics offers unprecedented capabilities for operating in uncertain, confined, and fragile environments that challenge conventional technologies. However, achieving true embodied intelligence—which requires continuous environmental sensing, real-time control, and autonomous decision-making—faces challenges in energy management and system integration. We developed deformation-resilient flexible batteries with enhanced performance under magnetic fields inherently present in magnetically actuated soft robots, with capacity retention after 200 cycles improved from 31.3 to 57.3%. These compliant batteries enable large-area deployment of 44.9% across the robot body, and their vertical integration with rationally designed flexible hybrid circuits minimizes additional stiffness while maintaining deformability. This actuator-battery-sensor vertical integration methodology maximizes functional area utilization in a manta ray–inspired soft robot, establishing an untethered platform with sensing, communication, and stable power supply. The system demonstrates embodied intelligence in aquatic environments through diverse capabilities including perturbation correction, obstacle avoidance, and temperature monitoring, with proprioceptive and environmental sensing enabling real-time decision-making during magnetically actuated locomotion.",10.1126/sciadv.adv9572,,Science Advances,2025-09-10,XiaosaLi; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5285-2502; XiaoXiao; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7365-9795; XiaoXiao; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7861-5596; ZixiaoLiu; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1161-1803; JunhaoGong; https://orcid.org/0009-0009-0142-3041; ZenanLin; BingXue; https://orcid.org/0009-0005-5047-0902; ShiboLiu; https://orcid.org/0009-0004-9282-3043; XinruWu; https://orcid.org/0009-0004-4546-4594; WeiZhang; DongkaiWang; RunzeZhao; https://orcid.org/0009-0000-0224-914X; ZihanWang; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4018-1603; XiongweiZhong; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2307-0450; YiliangLin; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9403-9464; PatrickChia; https://orcid.org/0009-0002-6195-189X; XiminHe; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8845-4637; John S.Ho; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9458-9033; Ghim WeiHo; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1276-0165; WeiOuyang; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4279-661X; WenboDing; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0597-4512; GuangminZhou; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3629-5686; CeciliaLaschi; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5248-1043; ChangshengWu; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0921-6356; Authors Info & Affiliations,incremental,2025-09-11T19:37:57,2025-09-11T19:37:57
60,DDX55 safeguards naïve T cell homeostasis by suppressing activation-promoting transposable elements,"AbstractNaïve T cells are maintained in a homeostatic state to preserve a stable T cell pool with diverse T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires, ensuring preparedness for priming. However, the underlying mechanisms controlling naïve T cell homeostasis and priming remain unclear. Leveraging a machine learning–based functional genetic screen, we identifiedDEAD-box helicase 55(Ddx55) as the top factor responsible for naïve T cell homeostasis. DDX55 was highly expressed in naïve T cells and suppressed enhancer- and promoter-like transposable elements (TEs) near T cell activation–associated genes.Ddx55loss led to derepression of these TEs, resulting in TE-derived R loops and genomic instability, ultimately disrupting naïve T cell homeostasis and abolishing T cell proliferation. Mechanistically, DDX55-targeted TEs harbored myelocytomatosis oncogene (MYC)–binding motifs. DDX55 directly bound MYC and restricted its access to these TE loci, thereby preventing inappropriate TE activation in naïve T cells. Thus, naïve T cells exploit DDX55 as a vital regulator of T cell activation, ensuring their genomic stability and homeostatic maintenance.",10.1126/sciimmunol.adq0457,https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.adq0457,Science Immunology,2025-09-05,MengyueWu; KepanLinghu; QiminYin; PingHe; XinyangYu; PengHu; RongyingHe; QinyunDu; ShengliWang; XiChen; ShaohuiWang; XingyunWu; MingfuZhang; KerenPeng; XiangWang; JuxiuLiu; DongDeng; GuangchaoCao; KuiWang; XianliMeng; QuanliYang; DezhiMu; ZhinanYin; LuChen; JiyuTong; Authors Info & Affiliations,incremental,2025-09-12T13:19:29,2025-09-12T13:19:29
59,AI-powered automated model construction for patient-specific CFD simulations of aortic flows,"AbstractImage-based modeling is essential for understanding cardiovascular hemodynamics and advancing the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Constructing patient-specific vascular models remains labor-intensive, error-prone, and time-consuming, limiting their clinical applications. This study introduces a deep-learning framework that automates the creation of simulation-ready vascular models from medical images. The framework integrates a segmentation module for accurate voxel-based vessel delineation with a surface deformation module that performs anatomically consistent and unsupervised surface refinements guided by medical image data. The integrated pipeline addresses key limitations of existing methods, enhancing geometric accuracy and computational efficiency. Evaluated on public datasets, it achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while substantially reducing manual effort and processing time. The resulting vascular models exhibit anatomically accurate and visually realistic geometries, effectively capturing both primary vessels and intricate branching patterns. In conclusion, this work advances the scalability and reliability of image-based computational modeling, facilitating broader applications in clinical and research settings.",10.1126/sciadv.adw2825,https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adw2825,Science Advances,2025-09-05,PanDu; DelinAn; ChaoliWang; Jian-XunWang; Authors Info & Affiliations,incremental,2025-09-12T13:18:09,2025-09-12T13:18:09
58,Machine learning– and multilayer molecular network–assisted screening hunts fentanyl compounds,"AbstractFentanyl and its analogs are a global concern, making their accurate identification essential for public health. Here, we introduce Fentanyl-Hunter, a screening platform that uses a machine learning classifier and multilayer molecular network to select and annotate fentanyl compounds using mass spectrometry (MS). Our classification model, based on 772 fentanyl spectra and spectral binning feature engineering, achieved anF1score of 0.868 ± 0.02. The multilayer network, based on spectral similarity and paired mass distances, covers more than 87% of known fentanyls. Fentanyl-Hunter identified fentanyl members in biological and environmental samples. During biotransformation, 35 metabolites from four widely consumed fentanyl derivatives were identified. Norfentanyl was the major fentanyl compound in wastewater. Retrospective screening of these biomarkers across more than 605,000 MS files in public datasets revealed fentanyl, sufentanil, norfentanyl, or remifentanil acid in more than 250 samples from eight major countries, indicating the potential widespread presence of fentanyl.",10.1126/sciadv.adw2799,https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adw2799,Science Advances,2025-09-05,ChangzhiShi; WanliLi; YangWang; XiChen; MeixiangYu; HaiZhang; ZecangYou; MaoyongSong; XiaojunDeng; MingliangFang; Authors Info & Affiliations,incremental,2025-09-12T13:18:09,2025-09-12T13:18:09
37,A clearer view of the current phase of unrest at Campi Flegrei caldera,"AbstractWe used a retrained machine learning workflow to enhance the performance of the seismic monitoring network at Campi Flegrei caldera (CFc) for improved tracking of the evolution of volcanic unrest. We analyzed the recent (1/21/22 – 03/20/25) continuous seismic data, which showed a sharp increase in seismicity at the highly populated CFc. Our analysis expanded the seismicity catalog from around 12,000 to over 54,000 earthquakes. The more complete picture of seismicity revealed a sharply defined caldera ring fault system (RFS) featuring a very narrow depth range of seismicity, clearly illuminated shallow faults in the northern part of the caldera and uncovered a source of very shallow hybrid earthquakes likely related to the hydrothermal system. To date, we have not observed any direct signature of upward migration of magma, nor have we observed seismic activity at depths below 3.7 km on or inside the RFS.",10.1126/science.adw9038,,Science,2025-09-04,XingTan; https://orcid.org/0009-0001-0919-3617; AnnaTramelli; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6259-5730; SergioGammaldi; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6089-2907; Gregory C.Beroza; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8667-1838; William L.Ellsworth; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8378-4979; WarnerMarzocchi; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9114-1516; Authors Info & Affiliations,incremental,2025-09-11T19:36:58,2025-09-11T19:36:58

Today’s mirror stabilization control injects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the 10- to 30-hertz band by over 30x and up to 100x in subbands, surpassing the design goal motivated by the quantum limit.

35,Cooperative actions of interneuron families support the hippocampal spatial code,"AbstractIdentifying the computational roles of different neuron families is crucial for understanding neural networks. Most neural diversity is embodied in various types of γ-aminobutyric acid–mediated (GABAergic) interneurons, grouped into four major families. We collected datasets of opto-tagged neurons from all four families, along with excitatory neurons, from both the neocortex and hippocampus. The physiological features of these neurons were used to train a machine learning classifier, which subsequently inferred specific interneuron families in large-scale recordings. This combined approach enabled the reconstruction of synaptic connectivity motifs across interneuron family members. We further showed that these motifs differentially control the place field features of pyramidal neurons.

57,Who expands the human creative frontier with generative AI: Hive minds or masterminds?,"AbstractArtists are rapidly integrating generative text-to-image models into their workflows, yet how this affects creative discovery remains unclear. Leveraging large-scale data from an online art platform, we compare artificial intelligence (AI)–assisted creators to matched nonadopters to assess novel idea contributions. Initially, a concentrated subset of AI-assisted creators contributes more novel artifacts in absolute terms through increased output—the productivity effect—although the average rate of contributing novel artifacts decreases because of a dilution effect. This reflects a shift toward high-volume, incremental exploration, ultimately yielding a greater aggregate of novel artifacts by AI-assisted creators. We observe no evidence of a human-AI effect above and beyond the productivity effect. The release of open-source Stable Diffusion accelerates novel contributions across a more diverse group, suggesting that text-to-image tools facilitate exploration at scale, initially enabling persistent breakthroughs by select “masterminds,” driven by increased volume, and subsequently enabling widespread novel contributions from a “hive mind.”",10.1126/sciadv.adu5800,https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adu5800,Science Advances,2025-09-03,Eric B.Zhou; DokyunLee; BinGu; Authors Info & Affiliations,incremental,2025-09-12T13:18:09,2025-09-12T13:18:09
54,RoboBallet: Planning for multirobot reaching with graph neural networks and reinforcement learning,"AbstractModern robotic manufacturing requires collision-free coordination of multiple robots to complete numerous tasks in shared, obstacle-rich workspaces. Although individual tasks may be simple in isolation, automated joint task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning under spatiotemporal constraints remain computationally intractable for classical methods at real-world scales. Existing multiarm systems deployed in industry rely on human intuition and experience to design feasible trajectories manually in a labor-intensive process. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to achieve automated task and motion planning, tested in an obstacle-rich environment with eight robots performing 40 reaching tasks in a shared workspace, where any robot can perform any task in any order. Our approach builds on a graph neural network (GNN) policy trained via RL on procedurally generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot configurations, and task distributions. It uses a graph representation of scenes and a graph policy neural network trained through RL to generate trajectories of multiple robots, jointly solving the subproblems of task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. Trained on large randomly generated task sets in simulation, our policy generalizes zero-shot to unseen settings with varying robot placements, obstacle geometries, and task poses. We further demonstrate that the high-speed capability of our solution enables its use in workcell layout optimization, improving solution times. The speed and scalability of our planner also open the door to capabilities such as fault-tolerant planning and online perception-based replanning, where rapid adaptation to dynamic task sets is required.",10.1126/scirobotics.ads1204,https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.ads1204,Science Robotics,2025-09-03,MatthewLai; KeeganGo; ZhibinLi; TorstenKröger; StefanSchaal; KelseyAllen; JonathanScholz; Authors Info & Affiliations,incremental,2025-09-12T06:44:35,2025-09-12T06:44:35
53,Attention-based map encoding for learning generalized legged locomotion,"AbstractDynamic locomotion of legged robots is a critical yet challenging topic in expanding the operational range of mobile robots. It requires precise planning when possible footholds are sparse, robustness against uncertainties and disturbances, and generalizability across diverse terrains. Although traditional model-based controllers excel at planning on complex terrains, they struggle with real-world uncertainties. Learning-based controllers offer robustness to such uncertainties but often lack precision on terrains with sparse steppable areas. Hybrid methods achieve enhanced robustness on sparse terrains by combining both methods but are computationally demanding and constrained by the inherent limitations of model-based planners. To achieve generalized legged locomotion on diverse terrains while preserving the robustness of learning-based controllers, this paper proposes an attention-based map encoding conditioned on robot proprioception, which is trained as part of the controller using reinforcement learning. We show that the network learns to focus on steppable areas for future footholds when the robot dynamically navigates diverse and challenging terrains. We synthesized behaviors that exhibited robustness against uncertainties while enabling precise and agile traversal of sparse terrains. In addition, our method offers a way to interpret the topographical perception of a neural network. We have trained two controllers for a 12-degrees-of-freedom quadrupedal robot and a 23-degrees-of-freedom humanoid robot and tested the resulting controllers in the real world under various challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios, including ones unseen during training.",10.1126/scirobotics.adv3604,https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adv3604,Science Robotics,2025-08-27,JunzheHe; ChongZhang; FabianJenelten; RubenGrandia; MoritzBächer; MarcoHutter; Authors Info & Affiliations,incremental,2025-09-12T06:44:35,2025-09-12T06:44:35

51,Learning contact-rich whole-body manipulation with example-guided reinforcement learning,"AbstractHumans use diverse skills and strategies to effectively manipulate various objects, ranging from dexterous in-hand manipulation (fine motor skills) to complex whole-body manipulation (gross motor skills). The latter involves full-body engagement and extensive contact with various body parts beyond just the hands, where the compliance of our skin and muscles plays a crucial role in increasing contact stability and mitigating uncertainty. For robots, synthesizing these contact-rich behaviors has fundamental challenges because of the rapidly growing combinatorics inherent to this amount of contact, making explicit reasoning about all contact interactions intractable. We explore the use of example-guided reinforcement learning to generate robust whole-body skills for the manipulation of large and unwieldy objects. Our method’s effectiveness is demonstrated on Toyota Research Institute’s Punyo robot, a humanoid upper body with highly deformable, pressure-sensing skin. Training was conducted in simulation with only a single example motion per object manipulation task, and policies were easily transferred to hardware owing to domain randomization and the robot’s compliance. The resulting agent can manipulate various everyday objects, such as a water jug and large boxes, in a similar fashion to the example motion. In addition, we show blind dexterous whole-body manipulation, relying solely on proprioceptive and tactile feedback without object pose tracking. Our analysis highlights the critical role of compliance in facilitating whole-body manipulation with humanoid robots.",10.1126/scirobotics.ads6790,https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.ads6790,Science Robotics,2025-08-20,Jose A.Barreiros; Aykut ÖzgünÖnol; MengchaoZhang; SamCreasey; AimeeGoncalves; AndrewBeaulieu; AdityaBhat; Kate M.Tsui; AlexAlspach; Authors Info & Affiliations,incremental,2025-09-12T06:44:35,2025-09-12T06:44:35
50,Precise and dexterous robotic manipulation via human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning,"AbstractRobotic manipulation remains one of the most difficult challenges in robotics, with approaches ranging from classical model-based control to modern imitation learning. Although these methods have enabled substantial progress, they often require extensive manual design, struggle with performance, and demand large-scale data collection. These limitations hinder their real-world deployment at scale, where reliability, speed, and robustness are essential. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful alternative by enabling robots to autonomously acquire complex manipulation skills through interaction. However, realizing the full potential of RL in the real world remains challenging because of issues of sample efficiency and safety. We present a human-in-the-loop, vision-based RL system that achieved strong performance on a wide range of dexterous manipulation tasks, including precise assembly, dynamic manipulation, and dual-arm coordination. These tasks reflect realistic industrial tolerances, with small but critical variations in initial object placements that demand sophisticated reactive control. Our method integrates demonstrations, human corrections, sample-efficient RL algorithms, and system-level design to directly learn RL policies in the real world. Within 1 to 2.5 hours of real-world training, our approach outperformed other baselines by improving task success by 2×, achieving near-perfect success rates, and executing 1.8× faster on average. Through extensive experiments and analysis, our results suggest that RL can learn a wide range of complex vision-based manipulation policies directly in the real world within practical training times. We hope that this work will inspire a new generation of learned robotic manipulation techniques, benefiting both industrial applications and research advancements.",10.1126/scirobotics.ads5033,https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.ads5033,Science Robotics,2025-08-20,JianlanLuo; CharlesXu; JeffreyWu; SergeyLevine; Authors Info & Affiliations,incremental,2025-09-12T06:44:35,2025-09-12T06:44:35
