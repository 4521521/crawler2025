23,A comparative analysis of urban and peri-urban flood identification using SAR imagery,"Flooding in urban areas causes significant economic and social impacts on populations across the globe. Flood detection plays a pivotal role in disaster management, necessitating advanced methodologies to enhance accuracy and efficiency. Addressing this challenge requires delineating flood extent at a high spatial and temporal resolution. Efforts to fully quantify urban flood distribution utilizing the potential of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imageries in a cloud-based platform have ample potential but have yet to produce viable results in the urban landscape. Flood detection has been a challenging task in urban areas due to limitations of spatial-temporal resolution and complex back scatter mechanisms in urban settings. However, advancement in big-data and cloud-computing, data acquisition, satellite image processing and predictive analysis are rapidly becoming more accessible. Building on recent advancements, this study presents an analysis of methods exploring and comparing identification of flooded areas in urban and peri-urban locations, which has not been fully described. Using Houston, TX to test these methods, we compare flood maps generated from multiple classification method including constant threshold Change Detection Approach (CDA), Otsu method, and Machine Learning (ML) classification with Random Forest (RF) model using Sentinel-1 SAR images in Google Earth Engine (GEE). An extensive performance evaluation is conducted, including accuracy assessments, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. The CDA approach shows the highest accuracy in peri-urban areas, while ML classifier outperforms both CDA and Otsu in urban settings. The analysis in this paper contributes to the development of flood detection methodologies in support of urban flood management.",10.1371/journal.pwat.0000269,https://journals.plos.org/water/article?id=10.1371/journal.pwat.0000269,PLOS Water,2025-09-11,Md Abdullah Al Mehedi; Virginia Smith; Peleg Kremer,incremental,2025-09-12T22:57:19,2025-09-12T22:57:19
18,Machine learning algorithms and their predictive accuracy for suicide and self-harm: Systematic review and meta-analysis,"There has been rapid expansion in the development of machine learning algorithms to predict suicidal behaviours. To test the accuracy of these algorithms for predicting suicide and hospital-treated self-harm, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis.

11,Human visual grouping based on within- and cross-area temporal correlations,"Perceptual organization in the human visual system involves neural mechanisms that spatially group and segment image areas based on local feature similarities, such as the temporal correlation of luminance changes. Successful segmentation models in computer vision, including graph-based algorithms and vision transformer, leverage similarity computations across all elements in an image, suggest that effective similarity-based grouping should rely on a global computational process. However, whether human vision employs a similarly global computation remains unclear due to the absence of appropriate methods for manipulating similarity matrices across multiple elements within a stimulus. To investigate how “temporal similarity structures” influence human visual segmentation, we developed a stimulus generation algorithm based on Vision Transformer. This algorithm independently controls within-area and cross-area similarities by adjusting the temporal correlation of luminance, color, and spatial phase attributes. To assess human segmentation performance with these generated texture stimuli, participants completed a temporal two-alternative forced-choice task, identifying which of two intervals contained a segmentable texture. The results showed that segmentation performance is significantly influenced by the configuration of both within- and cross-correlation across the elements, regardless of attribute type. Furthermore, human performance is closely aligned with predictions from a graph-based computational model, suggesting that human texture segmentation can be approximated by a global computational process that optimally integrates pairwise similarities across multiple elements.",10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013001,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013001,PLOS Computational Biology,2025-09-11,Yen-Ju Chen; Zitang Sun; Shin’ya Nishida,incremental,2025-09-12T22:05:57,2025-09-12T22:05:57
10,A curriculum learning approach to training antibody language models,"There is growing interest in pre-training antibody language models (AbLMs) with a mixture of unpaired and natively paired sequences, seeking to combine the proven benefits of training with natively paired sequences with the massive scale of unpaired antibody sequence datasets. However, given the novelty of this strategy, the field lacks a systematic evaluation of data processing methods and training strategies that maximize the benefits of mixed training data while accommodating the significant imbalance in the size of existing paired and unpaired datasets. Here, we introduce a method of curriculum learning for AbLMs, which facilitates a gradual transition from unpaired to paired sequences during training. We optimize this method and compare it to other data sampling strategies for AbLMs, including a constant mix and a fine-tuning approach. We observe that the curriculum and constant approaches show improved performance compared to the fine-tuning approach in large-scale models, likely due to their ability to prevent catastrophic forgetting and slow overfitting. Finally, we show that a 650M-parameter curriculum model, CurrAb, outperforms existing mixed AbLMs in downstream residue prediction and classification tasks.",10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013473,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013473,PLOS Computational Biology,2025-09-11,Sarah M.

9,HyperACP: A cutting-edge hybrid framework for anticancer peptide classification via scalable feature extraction and adaptive neighbor-based synthesis,"Cancer remains a major contributor to global mortality, constituting a significant and escalating threat to human health. Anticancer peptides (ACPs) have emerged as promising therapeutic agents due to their specific mechanisms of action, pronounced tumor-targeting capability, and low toxicity. Nevertheless, traditional approaches for ACP identification are constrained by their reliance on shallow, hand-crafted sequence features, which fail to capture deeper semantic and structural characteristics. Moreover, such models exhibit limited robustness and interpretability when confronted with practical challenges such as severe class imbalance. To address these limitations, this study proposes HyperACP, an innovative framework for ACP recognition that integrates deep representation learning, adaptive sampling, and mechanistic interpretability. The framework leverages the ESMC protein language model to extract comprehensive sequence features and employs a novel adaptive algorithm, ANBS, to mitigate class imbalance at the decision boundary. For enhanced model transparency, SHAP-Res is incorporated to elucidate the contributions of individual residues to the final predictions. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that HyperACP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets and validation protocols—including 10-fold cross-validation and independent test sets—according to metrics such as Accuracy (ACC), Sensitivity (SN), Specificity (SP), Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and Area Under the Curve (AUC). Furthermore, the model yields biologically interpretable results, pinpointing key residues (K, L, F, G) known to play pivotal roles in anticancer activity. These findings provide not only a robust predictive tool (available atwww.hyperacp.com) but also novel insights into the structure-function relationships underlying ACPs.",10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013489,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013489,PLOS Computational Biology,2025-09-11,Bangyi Zhang; Yun Zuo; Jun Wan; Jiayue Liu; Xiangrong Liu; Xiangxiang Zeng; Zhaohong Deng,incremental,2025-09-12T22:05:57,2025-09-12T22:05:57
8,Cortical networks with multiple interneuron types generate oscillatory patterns during predictive coding,"Predictive coding (PC) proposes that our brains work as an inference machine, generating an internal model of the world and minimizing predictions errors (i.e., differences between external sensory evidence and internal prediction signals). Theoretical models of PC often rely on high-level approaches, and therefore implementations detailing which neurons or pathways are used to compute prediction errors or adapt the internal representations, as well as their level of agreement with biological circuitry, are currently missing. Here we propose a computational model of PC, which integrates a neuroanatomically informed hierarchy of two cortical areas with a simplified laminar organization and cell-type-specific connectivity between excitatory, PV, SST and VIP cells. Our model efficiently performs PC, even in the presence of external and internal noise, by forming latent representations of naturalistic visual input (MNIST, fashion-MNIST and grayscale CIFAR-10) via Hebbian learning and using them to predict sensory input by minimizing prediction errors. The model assumes that both positive and negative prediction errors are computed by stereotypical excitatory-PV-SST-VIP circuits with the same structure but different incoming input. During sensory inference, neural oscillatory activity emerges in the system due to interactions between representation and prediction error microcircuits, with optogenetics-inspired inactivation protocols revealing a differentiated role of PV, SST and VIP cell types in such dynamics. Finally, our model shows anomalous responses to deviant stimuli within series of same-image presentations, in agreement with experimental results on mismatch negativity and oddball paradigms. We argue that our model constitutes an important step to better understand the circuits mediating PC in real cortical networks.",10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013469,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013469,PLOS Computational Biology,2025-09-10,Kwangjun Lee; Cyriel M.

21,CLASV: Rapid Lassa virus lineage assignment with random forest,"Lassa fever, caused by the Lassa virus (LASV), is a deadly disease characterized by hemorrhages. Annually, it affects approximately 300,000 people in West Africa and causes about 5,000 deaths. It currently has no approved vaccine and is categorized as a top-priority disease. Apart from its endemicity to West Africa, there have been exported cases in almost all continents, including several European countries. Distinct Lassa virus lineages circulate in specific regions, and have been reported to show varying immunological behaviors and may contribute to differing disease outcomes. It is therefore important to rapidly identify which lineage caused an outbreak or an exported case. We present CLASV, a machine learning-based lineage assignment tool built using a Random Forest classifier. CLASV processes raw nucleotide sequences and assigns them to the dominant circulating lineages (II, III, and IV/V) rapidly and accurately. CLASV is implemented in Python for ease of integration into existing workflows and is freely available for public use.",10.1371/journal.pntd.0013512,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0013512,PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases,2025-09-09,Richard Olumide Daodu; Ebenezer Awotoro; Jens-Uwe Ulrich; Denise Kühnert,incremental,2025-09-12T22:25:49,2025-09-12T22:25:49
22,Characterizing the temporal and spatial heterogeneous interaction among multiple indicators within water through time with fuzzy cognitive maps,"Water quality indicators are interrelated, and their interactions vary across different monitoring sites. Additionally, environmental management and policies introduce temporal and spatial heterogeneity. Therefore, predicting water quality indicators requires careful consideration of the relationship among all indicators. Traditional machine learning methods often struggle to process data from independent variables to dependent variables in an inexplicable manner. Some variables are both independent and dependent alongside the temporal axis. In contrast, Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) could model all variables over time to complete the time series prediction task involved with multi-variables, and then output a graph showing the relationship among all variables. Current research aims to uncover the temporal and spatial heterogeneity hidden in each monitoring site across different years via FCMs. This study aims to reveal the temporal and spatial heterogeneity in water quality data from 12 monitoring sites across nine rivers in Tongzhou, Beijing, China (1stJanuary, 2016–31stDecember, 2023). Using this comprehensive dataset, we construct interactive and predictive models for each site. The analyzed results from the produced graphs will help infer the interaction between any pair of variables and predict the concrete amount of variables in future time stamps. The effect between each pair of indicators could be qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed with the graph produced by FCMs. This approach helps in curbing and preventing water pollution by understanding the interactions between various factors.",10.1371/journal.pwat.0000400,https://journals.plos.org/water/article?id=10.1371/journal.pwat.0000400,PLOS Water,2025-09-08,Xu Wang; Meijia Wang; Deying Yu; Xiaoyan Liu; Peng Bai; Shiqi Sun; Jiaxuan Wu; Jianwei Qi; Chuangpeng Lian; Kun Wang; Linqiang Deng; Fuzhong Li; Kai Zhang,incremental,2025-09-12T22:57:19,2025-09-12T22:57:19
17,"Consent-driven, semi-automated data collection during birth and newborn resuscitation: Insights from the NewbornTime study","Accurate observations at birth and during newborn resuscitation are fundamental for quality improvement initiatives and research. However, manual data collection methods often lack consistency and objectivity, are not scalable, and may raise privacy concerns. The NewbornTime project aims to develop an AI system that generates accurate timelines from birth and newborn resuscitation events by automated video recording and processing, providing a source of objective and consistent data. This work aims to describe the implementation of the data collection system that is necessary to support the project’s purpose. Videos were recorded using thermal sensors in labor rooms and thermal and visible light cameras in resuscitation rooms. Consent from mothers was obtained before birth, and healthcare providers were given the option to delete videos by opting out on a case-by-case basis. The video collection process was designed to minimize interference with ongoing treatment and not impose unnecessary burden on healthcare providers. At Stavanger University Hospital, 1012 thermal videos of birth and 274 visible light videos of newborn stabilization and resuscitation have been collected during the data collection period from November 2021 to June 2025. The utilization of automated data collection and AI video processing around birth may allow for consistent and enhanced documentation, quality improvement initiatives, and research opportunities on sequence, timing and duration of treatment activities during acute events, with less effort needed for capturing data and improved privacy for participants.",10.1371/journal.pdig.0000730,https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0000730,PLOS Digital Health,2025-09-08,Sara Brunner; Anders Johannessen; Jorge García-Torres; Ferhat Özgur Catak; Øyvind Meinich-Bache; Siren Rettedal; Kjersti Engan,incremental,2025-09-12T22:06:42,2025-09-12T22:06:42
16,Evaluating anti-LGBTQIA+ medical bias in large language models,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in clinical settings for tasks ranging from patient communication to decision support. While these models demonstrate race-based and binary gender biases, anti-LGBTQIA+ bias remains understudied despite documented healthcare disparities affecting these populations. In this work, we evaluated the potential of LLMs to propagate anti-LGBTQIA+ medical bias and misinformation. We prompted 4 LLMs (Gemini 1.5 Flash, Claude 3 Haiku, GPT-4o, Stanford Medicine Secure GPT [GPT-4.0]) with 38 prompts consisting of explicit questions and synthetic clinical notes created by medically-trained reviewers and LGBTQIA+ health experts. The prompts consisted of pairs of prompts with and without LGBTQIA+ identity terms and explored clinical situations across two axes: (i) situations where historical bias has been observedversusnot observed, and (ii) situations where LGBTQIA+ identity is relevant to clinical careversusnot relevant. Medically-trained reviewers evaluated LLM responses for appropriateness (safety, privacy, hallucination/accuracy, and bias) and clinical utility. We found that all 4 LLMs generated inappropriate responses for prompts with and without LGBTQIA+ identity terms. The proportion of inappropriate responses ranged from 43-62% for prompts mentioning LGBTQIA+ identitiesversus47–65% for those without. The most common reason for inappropriate classification tended to be hallucination/accuracy, followed by bias or safety. Qualitatively, we observed differential bias patterns, with LGBTQIA+ prompts eliciting more severe bias. Average clinical utility score for inappropriate responses was lower than for appropriate responses (2.6versus3.7 on a 5-point Likert scale). Future work should focus on tailoring output formats to stated use cases, decreasing sycophancy and reliance on extraneous information in the prompt, and improving accuracy and decreasing bias for LGBTQIA+ patients. We present our prompts and annotated responses as a benchmark for evaluation of future models.

1,Continuous monitoring and machine vision reveals that developing gerbils exhibit structured social behaviors prior to the emergence of autonomy,"Investigating social and independent behavior structure in early life is critical for understanding development and brain maturation in social mammals. However, this investigation necessitates monitoring animals over weeks to months often with subsecond time resolution creating challenges for both lab studies focused on brief observation periods and field studies in which animal tracking can be imprecise. Here we used machine vision and two-week long continuous behavior recordings of families of gerbils, a highly social rodent, in large, undisturbed home environments to quantify the behavioral development of individual pups. We discovered that individual pups exhibited complex social behaviors from the first day they left the nest including a preference for interactions with siblings over parents. Critically, independent behaviors such as foraging for food and water emerged several days later, each with a stereotyped temporal trajectory. Analysis of individual animal development confirmed the quality of our tracking methods and the stability and distinctness of each behavioral measure. Our work supports a model in which early and sustained social interactions may be supportive of solitary exploration for physiological needs. This model suggests that understanding the development of behavioral independence as well as maturation of sensory and motor systems in social rodents such as gerbils may require integration of social behavioral knowledge earlier than typically considered.",10.1371/journal.pbio.3003348,https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003348,PLOS Biology,2025-09-08,Catalin Mitelut; Marielisa Diez Castro; Ralph E.

6,The detection of algebraic auditory structures emerges with self-supervised learning,"Humans can spontaneously detect complex algebraic structures. Historically, two opposing views explain this ability, at the root of language and music acquisition. Some argue for the existence of an innate and specific mechanism. Others argue that this ability emerges from experience: i.e. when generic learning principles continuously process sensory inputs. These two views, however, remain difficult to test experimentally. Here, we use deep learning models to evaluate the factors that lead to the spontaneous detection of algebraic structures in the auditory modality. Specifically, we use self-supervised learning to train multiple deep-learning models with a variable amount of either natural (environmental sounds) and/or cultural sounds (speech or music) to evaluate the impact of these stimuli. We then expose these models to the experimental paradigms classically used to evaluate the processing of algebraic structures. Like humans, these models spontaneously detect repeated sequences, probabilistic chunks, and complex algebraic structures. Also like humans, this ability diminishes with structure complexity. Importantly, this ability can emerge from experience alone: the more the models are exposed to natural sounds, the more they spontaneously detect increasingly complex structures. Finally, this ability does not emerge in models pretrained only on speech, and emerges more rapidly in models pretrained with music than environmental sounds. Overall, our study provides an operational framework to clarify sufficient built-in and acquired principles that model human’s advanced capacity to detect algebraic structures in sounds.",10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013271,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013271,PLOS Computational Biology,2025-09-05,Pierre Orhan; Yves Boubenec; Jean-Rémi King,incremental,2025-09-12T22:05:57,2025-09-12T22:05:57
5,Drug-induced liver injury prediction based on graph convolutional networks and toxicogenomics,"Drug-induced liver injury is a leading cause of high attrition rates for both candidate drugs and marketed medications. Previous in silico models may not effectively utilize biological drug property information and often lack robust model validation. In this study, we developed a graph convolutional network embedded with a biological graph learning (BioGL) module—named BioGL-GCN(Biological Graph Learning-Graph Convolutional Network)—for drug-induced liver injury prediction using toxicogenomic profiles. The BioGL module learned the optimal graph representations of gene interactions by utilizing the constructed protein-protein interaction network, which represents initial gene relationships, and gene frequency information obtained from gene enrichment analysis. Finally, the graph convolutional network was used to identify drug hepatotoxicity. Our method pays more attention to gene-gene relationships compared to previous approaches, thereby achieving more accurate predictive performance. We applied BioGL-GCN to predict DILI risk for active components in the integrated traditional Chinese medicine (ITCM) database and validated these predictions through hepatotoxicity experiments using a 3D primary human hepatocyte (PHH) model. The results showed that our model achieved a prediction accuracy of 79%, thus further validating the reliability of the constructed model.",10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013423,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013423,PLOS Computational Biology,2025-09-05,Tong Xiao; Ying Liu; Kaimiao Hu; Kaimin Guo; Mengying Zhang; TingTing Wang; Weihua Lei; Wenjia Wang; Shuiping Zhou; Yunhui Hu; Ran Su,incremental,2025-09-12T22:05:57,2025-09-12T22:05:57
4,Potentials and limitations in the application of Convolutional Neural Networks for mosquito species identification using wing images,"This study addresses the pressing global health burden of mosquito-borne diseases by investigating the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for mosquito species identification using wing images. Conventional identification methods are hampered by the need for significant expertise and resources, while CNNs offer a promising alternative. Our research aimed to develop a reliable and applicable classification system that can be used under real-world conditions, with a focus on improving model adaptability to unencountered devices, mitigating dataset biases, and ensuring usability across different users without standardized protocols. We utilized a large, diverse dataset of mosquito wing images of 21 taxa and three image-capturing devices (N = 14,888) and a preprocessing pipeline to standardize images and remove undesirable image features. The developed CNN models demonstrated high performance, with an average balanced accuracy of 98.3% and a macro F1-score of 97.6%, effectively distinguishing between the 21 mosquito taxa, including morphologically similar pairs. The preprocessing pipeline improved the model’s robustness, reducing performance drops on unfamiliar devices effectively. However, the study also highlights the persistence of inherent dataset biases, which the preprocessing steps could only partially mitigate. The classification system’s practical usability was demonstrated through a feasibility study, showing high inter-rater reliability. The results underscore the potential of the proposed workflow to enhance vector surveillance, especially in resource-constrained settings, and suggest its applicability to other winged insect species. The classification system developed in this study is available for public use, providing a valuable tool for vector surveillance and research, supporting efforts to mitigate the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.",10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013435,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1013435,PLOS Computational Biology,2025-09-05,Kristopher Nolte; Jan Baumbach; Christian Lins; Jens Johann Georg Lohmann; Philip Kollmannsberger; Felix Gregor Sauer; Renke Lühken,incremental,2025-09-12T22:05:57,2025-09-12T22:05:57
20,"Peace of mind: A quasi-experimental, mixed-method evaluation of a community-based mental health intervention for persons affected by Neglected Tropical Diseases","Evidence consistently shows high levels of mental distress amongst populations affected by skin NTDs. Self-help groups are thought to be a key intervention strategy to support affected persons. However, to date, self-help interventions have largely been concerned with physical improvements as opposed to psychological outcomes. This paper provides an evaluation of the impact of the ‘Peace of Mind’ intervention in Kasai Province, DRC. Peace of Mind was a community-based, peer-led mental health intervention, combining lay counselling, mutual support, self-care, and income generation activities within a self-help group model to address health, psychosocial and economic impacts of skin-NTDs. This mixed-methods study used a quasi-experimental difference-in-difference approach. A survey measured levels of depression, anxiety, and stigma before and after intervention. To facilitate data matching, machine learning was used to predict (based on age, sex, health zone and disability status) which participants in the baseline would have attended the self-help groups. In addition, qualitative and participatory methods including photovoice, in-depth interviews and key informant interviews were completed to elicit the experiences of group members and health staff. Our findings show that after 6 months of intervention this holistic approach was effective at reducing levels of depression (PHQ-9 score reduction ranging on average from -3.5 to -6.7 points,p< .05) and anxiety (GAD-7 score reduction from -2.0 to -3.3 points,p< .05) in persons affected by skin NTDs. However, the prevalence of depression (64%) and anxiety (52%) remained high with suicidal thoughts reported by 35% of respondents at endline. Whilst we found no impact on stigma scores, qualitative data indicated improvements to self-esteem and ability to take part in community life. To our knowledge, this is the first study in the DRC to evaluate the impact of a community-based, peer-led intervention on mental health outcomes of persons affected by skin-NTDs. Holistic self-help groups have the potential to serve as a key component of integrated NTD/mental health service provision at community-level. However, this should be accompanied by the integration of stigma-reduction strategies, the strengthening of primary health care capacities, and the establishment of mental health services at secondary and tertiary care levels.",10.1371/journal.pmen.0000423,https://journals.plos.org/mentalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmen.0000423,PLOS Mental Health,2025-09-04,Maaike L.

2,A single-graph visualization to reveal hidden explainability patterns of SHAP feature interactions in machine learning for biomedical issues,"In the last decades, the utility of Machine Learning (ML) in the biomedical domain has been demonstrated repeatedly. Their inherent opacity need augmenting ML with explainability techniques. A common practice in model explainability however, is to focus solely on the explanatory values themselves without accounting for both the main and interaction effects. While this approach simplifies interpretation, it potentially overlooks critical medical information since the nature of the interactions may provide clues to the underlying biological mechanisms. This article introduces a novel method for analyzing explanatory values of machine learning (ML) models, in the form of a comprehensive graphical visualization. The method not only emphasises the individual contributions of the features but also gives insights about the interactions they share with one another. Designed for local additive explanation methods, the proposed tool effectively translates the complex and multidimensional nature of these values into an intuitive single-graph format. It offers a clear window into how feature interactions contribute to the overall prediction of the ML model while aiding in the identification of various interaction types, such as mutual attenuation, positive/negative synergies or dominance of one feature over another. This approach provides insights for generating hypotheses, improving the transparency of ML models, particularly in the context of biology and medicine since living organisms are characterised by a multitude of parameters in complex interactions, a complexity that ensures the “stability” and robustness of structures and functions.",10.1371/journal.pcsy.0000060,https://journals.plos.org/complexsystems/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcsy.0000060,PLOS Complex Systems,2025-09-04,Félix Furger; Miguel Thomas; Julien Aligon; Emmanuel Doumard; Cyrille Delpierre; Louis Casteilla; Paul Monsarrat,incremental,2025-09-12T21:59:26,2025-09-12T21:59:26

3,Deep learning approach for automatic assessment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients using R-R intervals,"Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are severe mental illnesses that significantly impact quality of life. These disorders are associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which can be assessed through heart activity analysis. Heart rate variability (HRV) has shown promise as a potential biomarker for diagnostic support and early screening of those conditions. This study aims to develop and evaluate an automated classification method for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder using short-duration electrocardiogram (ECG) signals recorded with a low-cost wearable device. We conducted classification experiments using machine learning techniques to analyze R-R interval windows extracted from short ECG recordings. The study included 60 participants—30 individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and 30 control subjects. We evaluated multiple machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines, XGBoost, multilayer perceptrons, Gated Recurrent Units, and ensemble methods. Two time window lengths (about 1 and 5 minutes) were evaluated. Performance was assessed using 5-fold cross-validation and leave-one-out cross-validation, with hyperparameter optimization and patient-level classification based on individual window decisions. Our method achieved classification accuracy of 83% for the 5-fold cross-validation and 80% for the leave-one-out scenario. Despite the complexity of our scenario, which mirrors real-world clinical settings, the proposed approach yielded performance comparable to advanced diagnostic methods reported in the literature. The results highlight the potential of short-duration HRV analysis as a cost-effective and accessible tool for aiding in the diagnosis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Our findings support the feasibility of using wearable ECG devices and machine learning-based classification for psychiatric screening, paving the way for further research and clinical applications.",10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012983,https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012983,PLOS Computational Biology,2025-09-03,Kamil Książek; Wilhelm Masarczyk; Przemysław Głomb; Michał Romaszewski; Krisztián Buza; Przemysław Sekuła; Michał Cholewa; Katarzyna Kołodziej; Piotr Gorczyca; Magdalena Piegza,incremental,2025-09-12T22:05:57,2025-09-12T22:05:57
19,The effect of weight loss on brain age in schizophrenia spectrum disorders,"Individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) suffer from metabolic conditions including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Moreover, they are at a high risk for cardiovascular disease and this could lead to a shortened life expectancy. Obesity is one of common comorbid conditions in SSDs, which has adverse effects on brain health. However, it is still unknown how metabolic disorders affect brain anatomy in SSDs, and the impacts of weight loss from pharmacological interventions are yet to be studied. This study includes a total of 48 patients with SSDs from three different clinical trials focusing on weight loss interventions. We acquired metabolic parameters, brain anatomical MRI, body mass index (BMI), cognition, and psychopathology scores at baseline and endpoint. We used a convolutional neural network-based classifier to calculate each patient’s brain-age gap estimate (brainAGE) based on high-quality brain structural T1 images. We examined the relationship between the reduction in BMI and brainAGE between two timepoints. There was a significant reduction in BMI (p < 0.001) between two timepoints. Additionally, the analysis revealed that none of the cognitive, or psychopathology measures demonstrated significant differences between the timepoints (p > 0.05). The results of the multiple regression analysis showed a positive association between the reduction in BMI and brainAGE (F(2,44) = 3.69, p = 0.03). Furthermore, there were no noteworthy associations observed between brainAGE and the aforementioned parameters (p > 0.05). This study revealed a positive correlation between brainAGE and significant weight loss in SSDs with comorbid obesity.",10.1371/journal.pmen.0000346,https://journals.plos.org/mentalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmen.0000346,PLOS Mental Health,2025-09-02,Vittal Korann; Nicolette Stogios; Karen Marie Sandø Ambrosen; Gary Remington; Ariel Graff-Guerrero; Bjørn H.

13,Detecting papilloedema as a marker of raised intracranial pressure using artificial intelligence: A systematic review,"Automated detection of papilloedema using artificial intelligence (AI) and retinal images acquired through an ophthalmoscope for triage of patients with potential intracranial pathology could prove to be beneficial, particularly in resource-limited settings where access to neuroimaging may be limited. However, a comprehensive overview of the current literature on this field is lacking. We conducted a systematic review on the use of AI for papilloedema detection by searching four databases: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore. Included studies were assessed for quality of reporting using the Checklist for AI in Medical Imaging and appraised using a novel 5-domain rubric, ‘SMART’, for the presence of bias. For a subset of studies, we also assessed the diagnostic test accuracy using the ‘Metadta’ command on Stata. Nineteen deep learning systems and eight non-deep learning systems were included. The median number of images of normal optic discs used in the training set was 2509 (IQR 580–9156) and in the testing set was 569 (IQR 119–1378). The number of papilloedema images in the training and testing sets was lower with a median of 1292 (IQR 201–2882) in training set and 201 (IQR 57–388) in the testing set. Age and gender were the two most frequently reported demographic data, included by one-third of the studies. Only ten studies performed external validation. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were calculated to be 0.87 [95% CI 0.76-0.93] and 0.90 [95% CI 0.74-0.97], respectively. Though AI model performance values are reported to be high, these results need to be interpreted with caution due highly biased data selection, poor quality of reporting, and limited evidence of reproducibility. Deep learning models show promise in retinal image analysis of papilloedema, however, external validation using large, diverse datasets in a variety of clinical settings is required before it can be considered a tool for triage of intracranial pathologies in resource-limited areas.",10.1371/journal.pdig.0000783,https://journals.plos.org/digitalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pdig.0000783,PLOS Digital Health,2025-09-02,Lekaashree Rambabu; Thomas Edmiston; Brandon G.
