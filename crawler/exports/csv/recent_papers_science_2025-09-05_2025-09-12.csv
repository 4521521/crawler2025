43,Robotic reading companions can mitigate oral reading anxiety in children,"AbstractReading fluency is a vital building block for developing literacy, yet the best way to practice fluency—reading aloud—can cause anxiety severe enough to inhibit literacy development in ways that can have an adverse effect on students through adulthood. One promising intervention to mitigate oral reading anxiety is to have children read aloud to a robot. Although observations in prior work have suggested that people likely feel more comfortable in the presence of a robot instead of a human, few studies have empirically demonstrated that people feel less anxious performing in front of a robot compared with a human or used objective physiological indicators to identify decreased anxiety. To investigate whether a robotic reading companion could reduce reading anxiety felt by children, we conducted a within-subjects study where children aged 8 to 11 years (n= 52) read aloud to a human and a robot individually while being monitored for physiological responses associated with anxiety. We found that children exhibited fewer physiological indicators of anxiety, specifically vocal jitter and heart rate variability, when reading to the robot compared with reading to a person. This paper provides strong evidence that a robot’s presence has an effect on the anxiety a person experiences while doing a task, offering justification for the use of robots in a wide-reaching array of social interactions that may be anxiety inducing.",10.1126/scirobotics.adu5771,,Science Robotics,2025-09-10,Lauren L.Wright; https://orcid.org/0009-0002-3659-2530; PoojaVegesna; https://orcid.org/0009-0007-4249-6103; Joseph E.Michaelis; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3793-3659; BilgeMutlu; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9456-1495; SarahSebo; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2211-6429; Authors Info & Affiliations,incremental,2025-09-11T20:55:41,2025-09-11T20:55:41
42,Observing a robot peer’s failures facilitates students’ classroom learning,"AbstractAccording to productive failure (PF) theory, experiencing failure during problem-solving can enhance students’ knowledge acquisition in subsequent instruction. However, challenging students with problems beyond their current capabilities may strain their skills, prior knowledge, and emotional well-being. To address this, we designed a social robot–assisted teaching activity in which students observed a robot’s unsuccessful problem-solving attempts, offering a PF-like preparatory effect without requiring direct failure. We conducted two classroom-based studies in a middle school setting to evaluate the method’s effectiveness. In study 1 (N= 135), we compared three instructional methods—observing robot failure (RF), individual problem-solving failure, and direct instruction—in an eighth-grade mathematics lesson. Students in the RF condition showed the greatest gains in conceptual understanding and reported lower social pressure, although no significant differences were found in procedural knowledge or knowledge transfer. Follow-up study 2 (N= 110) further validated the method’s effectiveness in supporting knowledge acquisition after a 2-week robot-involved adaptation phase, when the novelty effect had largely subsided. Students confirmed their perception of the robot as a peer, and they offered positive evaluations of its intelligence and neutral views of its anthropomorphism. Our findings suggest that observing the robot’s failure has a comparable, or even greater, effect on knowledge acquisition than experiencing failure firsthand. These results underscore the value of social robots as peers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education and highlight the potential of integrating robotics with evidence-based teaching strategies to enhance learning outcomes.",10.1126/scirobotics.adu5257,,Science Robotics,2025-09-10,LiuqingChen; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9049-0394; YuCai; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1994-7176; YuyangFang; https://orcid.org/0009-0001-5604-5449; ZiqiYang; https://orcid.org/0009-0008-8064-7002; DuoweiXia; https://orcid.org/0009-0004-1084-3949; JiaxiangYou; https://orcid.org/0009-0003-8945-5764; ShuhongXiao; https://orcid.org/0009-0007-0615-0607; YaxuanSong; https://orcid.org/0009-0005-2664-4386; LingweiZhan; https://orcid.org/0009-0000-8033-311X; JuanjuanChen; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1273-9465; LingyunSun; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5561-0493; Authors Info & Affiliations,incremental,2025-09-11T20:55:41,2025-09-11T20:55:41

40,Differential modulation of movement speed with state-dependent deep brain stimulation in Parkinson’s disease,"AbstractSubthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) provides unprecedented spatiotemporal precision for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease (PD), allowing for direct real-time state-specific adjustments. Inspired by findings from optogenetic stimulation in mice, we hypothesized that STN-DBS can mimic dopaminergic reinforcement of ongoing movement kinematics during stimulation. To investigate this hypothesis, we delivered DBS bursts during particularly fast and slow movements in 24 patients with PD. Our findings reveal that DBS during fast movements enhanced future movement speed more than DBS during slow movements, raising movement speed to the level of healthy controls. To understand which brain circuits mediate this neurophysiological mechanism, we investigated the behavioral effects using magnetic resonance imaging connectomics and motor cortex electrocorticography. Last, we demonstrate that machine learning–based brain signal decoding can be used to predict continuous movement speed for fully embedded state-dependent closed-loop algorithms. Our findings provide important evidence for reinforcement-based DBS circuit mechanisms that may inspire previously unexplored treatment avenues for dopaminergic disorders.",10.1126/sciadv.adx6849,,Science Advances,2025-09-10,AlessiaCavallo; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1717-1378; Richard M.Köhler; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5219-1289; Johannes L.Busch; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1280-5928; Jeroen G.

39,Printed sensing human-machine interface with individualized adaptive machine learning,"AbstractDeveloping intelligent robots with integrated sensing capabilities is critical for advanced manufacturing, medical robots, and embodied intelligence. Existing robotic sensing technologies are limited to recording of acceleration, driving torque, pressure feedback, and so on. Expanding and integrating with the multimodal sensors to mimic and even surpass the human feeling is substantially underdeveloped. Here, we introduce a printed soft human-machine interface consisting of an e-skin–enabled gesture recognitions with feedback stimulus and a soft robot with multimodal perception of contact pressure, temperature, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity. The sensing e-skin with adaptive machine learning was able to decode and classify the hand gestures with re-wearable convenience and individual’s differences. The soft interface provides the bidirectional communications between robotics and human bodies in the close-loop. This work could substantially extend the robotic intelligence and pave the way for more practical applications.",10.1126/sciadv.adw3725,,Science Advances,2025-09-10,GuohuiWang; https://orcid.org/0009-0001-9934-5759; YaoTang; XinranLuo; https://orcid.org/0009-0005-6328-0753; ShengdiLu; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5313-2902; YiruZhou; YiLu; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0912-7724; GuangyangSun; https://orcid.org/0009-0006-1308-1403; PeiLiu; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6098-5284; JiayuNing; HuaJiang; KeHu; HongzhenLiu; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6687-1752; WenqiSong; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9627-6420; YouYu; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7059-7023; Authors Info & Affiliations,incremental,2025-09-11T19:37:57,2025-09-11T19:37:57
38,Magnetic field–enhanced vertical integration enables embodied intelligence in untethered soft robots,"AbstractEmbodied intelligence in soft robotics offers unprecedented capabilities for operating in uncertain, confined, and fragile environments that challenge conventional technologies. However, achieving true embodied intelligence—which requires continuous environmental sensing, real-time control, and autonomous decision-making—faces challenges in energy management and system integration. We developed deformation-resilient flexible batteries with enhanced performance under magnetic fields inherently present in magnetically actuated soft robots, with capacity retention after 200 cycles improved from 31.3 to 57.3%. These compliant batteries enable large-area deployment of 44.9% across the robot body, and their vertical integration with rationally designed flexible hybrid circuits minimizes additional stiffness while maintaining deformability. This actuator-battery-sensor vertical integration methodology maximizes functional area utilization in a manta ray–inspired soft robot, establishing an untethered platform with sensing, communication, and stable power supply. The system demonstrates embodied intelligence in aquatic environments through diverse capabilities including perturbation correction, obstacle avoidance, and temperature monitoring, with proprioceptive and environmental sensing enabling real-time decision-making during magnetically actuated locomotion.",10.1126/sciadv.adv9572,,Science Advances,2025-09-10,XiaosaLi; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5285-2502; XiaoXiao; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7365-9795; XiaoXiao; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7861-5596; ZixiaoLiu; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1161-1803; JunhaoGong; https://orcid.org/0009-0009-0142-3041; ZenanLin; BingXue; https://orcid.org/0009-0005-5047-0902; ShiboLiu; https://orcid.org/0009-0004-9282-3043; XinruWu; https://orcid.org/0009-0004-4546-4594; WeiZhang; DongkaiWang; RunzeZhao; https://orcid.org/0009-0000-0224-914X; ZihanWang; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4018-1603; XiongweiZhong; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2307-0450; YiliangLin; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9403-9464; PatrickChia; https://orcid.org/0009-0002-6195-189X; XiminHe; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8845-4637; John S.Ho; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9458-9033; Ghim WeiHo; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1276-0165; WeiOuyang; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4279-661X; WenboDing; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0597-4512; GuangminZhou; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3629-5686; CeciliaLaschi; https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5248-1043; ChangshengWu; https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0921-6356; Authors Info & Affiliations,incremental,2025-09-11T19:37:57,2025-09-11T19:37:57
60,DDX55 safeguards naïve T cell homeostasis by suppressing activation-promoting transposable elements,"AbstractNaïve T cells are maintained in a homeostatic state to preserve a stable T cell pool with diverse T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires, ensuring preparedness for priming. However, the underlying mechanisms controlling naïve T cell homeostasis and priming remain unclear. Leveraging a machine learning–based functional genetic screen, we identifiedDEAD-box helicase 55(Ddx55) as the top factor responsible for naïve T cell homeostasis. DDX55 was highly expressed in naïve T cells and suppressed enhancer- and promoter-like transposable elements (TEs) near T cell activation–associated genes.Ddx55loss led to derepression of these TEs, resulting in TE-derived R loops and genomic instability, ultimately disrupting naïve T cell homeostasis and abolishing T cell proliferation. Mechanistically, DDX55-targeted TEs harbored myelocytomatosis oncogene (MYC)–binding motifs. DDX55 directly bound MYC and restricted its access to these TE loci, thereby preventing inappropriate TE activation in naïve T cells. Thus, naïve T cells exploit DDX55 as a vital regulator of T cell activation, ensuring their genomic stability and homeostatic maintenance.",10.1126/sciimmunol.adq0457,https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.adq0457,Science Immunology,2025-09-05,MengyueWu; KepanLinghu; QiminYin; PingHe; XinyangYu; PengHu; RongyingHe; QinyunDu; ShengliWang; XiChen; ShaohuiWang; XingyunWu; MingfuZhang; KerenPeng; XiangWang; JuxiuLiu; DongDeng; GuangchaoCao; KuiWang; XianliMeng; QuanliYang; DezhiMu; ZhinanYin; LuChen; JiyuTong; Authors Info & Affiliations,incremental,2025-09-12T13:19:29,2025-09-12T13:19:29
59,AI-powered automated model construction for patient-specific CFD simulations of aortic flows,"AbstractImage-based modeling is essential for understanding cardiovascular hemodynamics and advancing the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Constructing patient-specific vascular models remains labor-intensive, error-prone, and time-consuming, limiting their clinical applications. This study introduces a deep-learning framework that automates the creation of simulation-ready vascular models from medical images. The framework integrates a segmentation module for accurate voxel-based vessel delineation with a surface deformation module that performs anatomically consistent and unsupervised surface refinements guided by medical image data. The integrated pipeline addresses key limitations of existing methods, enhancing geometric accuracy and computational efficiency. Evaluated on public datasets, it achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while substantially reducing manual effort and processing time. The resulting vascular models exhibit anatomically accurate and visually realistic geometries, effectively capturing both primary vessels and intricate branching patterns. In conclusion, this work advances the scalability and reliability of image-based computational modeling, facilitating broader applications in clinical and research settings.",10.1126/sciadv.adw2825,https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adw2825,Science Advances,2025-09-05,PanDu; DelinAn; ChaoliWang; Jian-XunWang; Authors Info & Affiliations,incremental,2025-09-12T13:18:09,2025-09-12T13:18:09
58,Machine learning– and multilayer molecular network–assisted screening hunts fentanyl compounds,"AbstractFentanyl and its analogs are a global concern, making their accurate identification essential for public health. Here, we introduce Fentanyl-Hunter, a screening platform that uses a machine learning classifier and multilayer molecular network to select and annotate fentanyl compounds using mass spectrometry (MS). Our classification model, based on 772 fentanyl spectra and spectral binning feature engineering, achieved anF1score of 0.868 ± 0.02. The multilayer network, based on spectral similarity and paired mass distances, covers more than 87% of known fentanyls. Fentanyl-Hunter identified fentanyl members in biological and environmental samples. During biotransformation, 35 metabolites from four widely consumed fentanyl derivatives were identified. Norfentanyl was the major fentanyl compound in wastewater. Retrospective screening of these biomarkers across more than 605,000 MS files in public datasets revealed fentanyl, sufentanil, norfentanyl, or remifentanil acid in more than 250 samples from eight major countries, indicating the potential widespread presence of fentanyl.",10.1126/sciadv.adw2799,https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adw2799,Science Advances,2025-09-05,ChangzhiShi; WanliLi; YangWang; XiChen; MeixiangYu; HaiZhang; ZecangYou; MaoyongSong; XiaojunDeng; MingliangFang; Authors Info & Affiliations,incremental,2025-09-12T13:18:09,2025-09-12T13:18:09
